<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s a deal. Or is it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After apartment-hunting in Williamsburg, Brooklyn[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/brooklyn/?inline=nyt-geo], for months this spring, Dr. Ronald Nath finally lucked out with a two-bedroom duplex at the top of a condominium, listed at $800,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A day after a crowded open house, Dr. Nath, a Massachusetts[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/great-homes-and-destinations/destinations/new-england/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] surgeon, offered $803,000 for the unit, which was to be a home for his son David, a television news producer. But because of its location and the outdoor spaces on both floors, the unit attracted more than a dozen offers, which prompted the seller to request higher bids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For his “best and final” offer, which usually signals the end of the haggling process, Dr. Nath promised $912,000, which seemed to do the trick. The seller congratulated Dr. Nath and told him the unit was his; a contract was drawn up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not so fast. A few days later, like a kite in a gust of wind, the price soared again, to $995,000. Insulted by what he described as being “played,” Dr. Nath refused to raise his offer and ultimately lost the unit to a buyer who plunked down $1.1 million. “I was absolutely outraged,” he said. “When you give your word that a deal is done, you’re supposed to fulfill your agreement.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A real estate deal, like any other business transaction, isn’t ironclad until signatures wind up on a contract, said Tom Le of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, the seller’s broker, who defended his clients’ right to get the highest possible price for their unit, even if it left some raw feelings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Of course Dr. Nath is going to be upset, because his heart was set on the apartment,” Mr. Le said. “But the truth is, Dr. Nath was given every single opportunity to match the price.” He added that after watching home values plummet over the last few years, sellers finally have relief. “They’ve been scraping by for years just to get to this point.” Both the seller and the buyer declined to comment, said Mr. Le, who added that even he had been taken aback by the intensity of interest in the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether caused by economics, or the unseemly equivalent of moving the goalposts to prevent touchdowns, experiences like Dr. Nath’s are becoming more common in a market with a huge pool of buyers chasing a limited number of homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not too long ago, an accepted offer marked the home stretch of the deal: the expectation was that the two sides would sign a contract and a deposit check would be cashed a few days later. Now, as sellers go back on their word and repeatedly increase their asking prices, “best and final” often seems to mean “O.K. and almost there,” according to real estate industry sources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buoyed by a new confidence in the market, some sellers seem intent on keeping the bidding alive even after there appears to be a winner, with some demanding sharply higher prices, as in Dr. Nath’s case, and others coming back with gradual $15,000 bumps every week or so. Are these sellers merely reacting to a fast-moving market — or are they, as unlucky buyers might suggest, just being greedy?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s surprising how ugly it’s getting.” said Robert Frankel, a real estate lawyer who has handled closings for two decades. Years ago, goalpost-shifting was virtually nonexistent, he said. Recently, he has been seeing one a week, while other lawyers have complained about having to draft multiple contracts for some properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you don’t hear back about a contract in two days,” Mr. Frankel said, “there are usually some shenanigans going on.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even sellers’ brokers, who are in theory supposed to take the same tack as their clients, can be left shaking their heads about how deals play out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, soon after a three-bedroom condo on Ludlow Street on the Lower East Sidewas listed at $1.695 million, offers began rolling in. But the seller, perhaps miffed that the bids failed to match the asking price, did not immediately pounce on any of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, in March, he accepted Barry Schwabsky’s $1.55 million offer. But then he proceeded to ignore the agreement and increase the price by $10,000 or $15,000 a week, said Emily Fuller Kingston of Halstead Property, his own broker. “The price was like a moving target,” she said. “The owner kept coming back and saying, ‘We really need more money.’ It was agony.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one point, an increase was justified by a rumor that the SoHo House[https://www.sohohouseny.com/], the popular meatpacking district private club, would soon be opening a local outpost, said Mr. Schwabsky, an art critic. After going five rounds with the seller, he ended up paying $1.65 million, in a deal that closed this month. Although the presence of another bidder may also have been a factor in the ever-increasing price, Mr. Schwabsky, who has bought real estate before, felt that the seller negotiated in bad faith. “It somehow felt like the last bit of toothpaste kept getting squeezed out of the tube,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Claire Groome, the <span class="companylink">Warburg Realty</span> broker who represented Mr. Schwabsky, was more blunt. “It was a little bit greedy,” said Ms. Groome, who has sold houses for 11 years. “I’m a big believer that when you give your word, you honor it.” The seller did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Groome’s concerns may have reached the ears of her boss, Frederick W. Peters, Warburg’s president, who weighed in on the topic in a recent blog post[http://www.warburgrealty.com/blog/?m=201302]. “The idea which so many of us grew up with that your word is your bond seems to have been replaced by the notion that greed is good,” Mr. Peters wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet if owners are taking negotiations to new lengths, their apparent reluctance to commit to a deal could almost be understood as a type of seller’s remorse. Indeed, with open houses routinely drawing hundreds, and people swooping in with juiced-up offers at the 11th hour, sellers would seem to have a powerful incentive to sit back and wait. Or maybe the sweltering market simply caught them unaware.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Sellers are constantly shifting the bar higher, and in some cases, rightfully so,” said a longtime Manhattan[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/manhattan/?inline=nyt-geo] broker who, like some others interviewed, asked to remain anonymous, in part because they’re involved in transactions of this type. “There’s a lapse between the time when a listing is priced and activity on that listing,” the broker added, “and prices are climbing in that period — that’s why this market is setting a new bar.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Lewis of Halstead, a 14-year industry veteran, is another broker sympathetic to this new sellers’ quandary. Moreover, he added, this should be familiar territory for many buyers. “It’s a competitive city,” he said. “Where there is a rope line around a property, it brings out the New Yorker in all of us.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, no-apologies hardball tactics may have their limits. “Up to a point, it’s business, but beyond that, it becomes dangerous, because you will lose that buyer.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any case, buyers aren’t always the good guys. When the market favored them — as when there was a surfeit of inventory in the middle of the last decade — they were known to walk away from deals themselves. “They would just move on to properties that were less expensive,” said Nandini Nathani, a Halstead broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This winter one of her buyers, Sunil Bhavnani, thought he had snagged a one-bedroom condo in Midtown West for $1.255 million. He signed a contract, wrote a check for 10 percent of the total and, confident that the deal was as good as wrapped up, headed to India on a trip. But days before the seller was supposed to sign the contract, Mr. Bhavnani got a call telling him there had been a change of plans. An offer of $1.28 million had been made, the seller said, and Mr. Bhavnani’s bid needed to come up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You’re really in the dark about what’s happening on the other side,” said Mr. Bhavnani, who works for a financial services firm. “Is that other offer real or fictitious? You just don’t know.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But match it he did, and he closed on the apartment in February. “I felt my client was overpaying,” Ms. Nathani said. “Ethically, the seller should not have done what he did. The finish line was moved.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether commonplace, or justifiable within certain definitions, the practice is troubling, said Anthony J. Gray, the president of the Institute for Global Ethics[http://www.globalethics.org/].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Society is not any greedier than it used to be, said Mr. Gray, a former lawyer, and sellers may have perfectly defensible reasons for doing what they’re doing. But, he added, “We sometimes confuse legal commitment with moral commitment.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not to mention the fact that leaving buyers with the impression they might soon have a new home is effectively lying. “Truth-telling is valuable for every culture,” Mr. Gray said. “It helps individual groups and civilizations progress.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then again, when told about the feeding frenzy that has erupted in New York real estate in the last few months, Mr. Gray couldn’t resist adding, “it’s great to hear the market is on the rebound.”</p>

</div><div class="author">By ANNIE LOWREY   </div><div>1127 words</div><div>18 July 2013</div><div>International Herald Tribune</div><div>INHT</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China’s growth has slowed significantly in recent months. But even its current pace of expansion may be unsustainable unless the country starts making significant and systemic changes to its economy, and soon, the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> warned Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Since the global crisis, a mix of investment, credit and fiscal stimulus has underpinned activity,’’ the I.M.F. said in a major annual assessment of the Chinese economy. ‘‘This pattern of growth is not sustainable and is raising vulnerabilities. While China still has significant buffers to weather shocks, the margins of safety are diminishing.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report emphasized downside risks to the Chinese economy, touching on familiar themes though imparting a greater sense of urgency than it has in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country still has large foreign currency reserves and plenty of room for new government spending to buffer against any unexpected shocks, Markus Rodlauer, the I.M.F.’s China mission chief, said in an interview. But he said the Chinese economy was looking more and more vulnerable, with changes only getting harder to make as time goes on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The I.M.F. — along with a variety of international economic officials, research groups, academics and financial market participants — has raised concern that money is pouring into mispriced real estate and infrastructure investments in China that are increasing growth in the short term but might do little for the Chinese economy down the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, a cheap currency, cheap labor and huge infrastructure investments fueled enormous growth in the nation. China has made ‘‘substantial’’ progress on rebalancing its trade deficits with the rest of the world, the I.M.F. said, and its current account balance as a share of its total economy is less than a quarter of its precrisis peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund described the Chinese currency as ‘‘moderately’’ undervalued, as it has for about a year after a long stretch of describing it as ‘‘significantly’’ undervalued — a policy maneuver that helped increase Chinese exports but angered many foreign countries whose goods became relatively less competitive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But imbalances in China’s domestic economy ‘‘remain large,’’ the I.M.F. warned, with Chinese consumers failing to take over for the consumers from the United States, Germany and other countries who helped stoke China’s growth for years. Consumption rates have barely budged from last year. But net purchases of physical assets like roads, hospitals and commercial buildings grew further as a share of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘A decisive shift toward a more consumption-based growth path has yet to occur,’’ the I.M.F. said. ‘‘Accelerating the transformation of the growth model remains the main priority.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The I.M.F. focused on a few spots of acute risk in the Chinese economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One is the financial system. The country has seen a huge boom in lending through ‘‘less regulated’’ parts of its financial system, it said. The report raised concerns about the adequacy of the country’s regulatory controls and about the quality of underwriting and the pricing of risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The formal banking sector might not be as strong as it looks either, the I.M.F. warned. ‘‘Based on reported data, bank balance sheets appear healthy and loan books show only a modest deterioration in asset quality,’’ it wrote. ‘‘However, banks remain vulnerable to a sharper worsening of corporate sector financial performance.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another issue is a proliferation of debt-financed spending by local governments without adequate tax bases, often through ‘‘local government financing vehicles’’ that have long been fingered as a weak spot in China’s markets. ‘‘Further rapid growth of debts would raise the risk of a disorderly adjustment in local government spending,’’ the I.M.F. warned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, it also cautioned about the possibility of sharp price drops in the real estate markets, which remain ‘‘prone to bubbles,’’ the I.M.F. said, in no small part because many Chinese savers do not earn interest on their deposits and thus push money into the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making adjustments to the financial markets and correcting the pace of infrastructure spending might mean slower growth in the near term, the I.M.F. has said. But it might mean more sustainable growth in the long term, with substantial benefits not just for China but for global growth as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that message is coming as the Chinese economy is already slowing down considerably, with growth falling to an annual pace of about 7.5 percent, down from a peak of more than 14 percent in 2007, before the global financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More broadly, the emerging market economies that helped pull the world out of the global recession have cooled of late, dragging down the global growth rate with them. Growth remains sluggish in the United States, and much of Europe is mired in a recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Growth in emerging-market economies will remain high, much higher than in the advanced economies, but may be substantially lower than it was before the crisis,’’ Olivier Blanchard, the I.M.F.’s chief economist, said at a news briefing this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers in Beijing are aware of the issues that the I.M.F. and other analysts have raised and are aiming to restructure the economy in a bid to make future growth more sustainable. The fact that China’s population is aging — and its labor force gradually shrinking — adds to the pressure for structural overhauls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authorities are now aiming to raise domestic consumption and productivity, reduce China’s reliance on exports and construction investment, and rein in financial risks flagged in the I.M.F.’s report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, Beijing has made it increasingly clear that it is prepared to tolerate a slower pace of growth as it pursues those goals and that there will be no repeat of an aggressive stimulus that followed the global financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Li Keqiang reiterated that message in comments reported by the official <span class="companylink">Xinhua</span> news agency on Wednesday. Although he acknowledged that the economy faced risks and challenges, he said, it remained ‘‘generally stable,’’ according to the report. And while the authorities must work to ‘‘keep economic growth within a reasonable range,’’ they would aim to deploy ‘‘targeted’’ policies and ‘‘not change the direction of policies based only on temporary changes in economic barometers,’’ <span class="companylink">Xinhua</span> quoted Mr. Li as saying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Beijing is trying to boost public confidence and emphasize the seriousness of its intention by reiterating the need to stabilize growth,’’ Qu Hongbin, chief China economist at <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> in Hong Kong, wrote in a note on Wednesday, referring to Mr. Li’s comments. ‘‘We expect further modest fiscal stimulus to put a floor on growth.’’</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rarefied few who can afford to shell out tens of millions of dollars for an apartment in one of the gleaming new condominiums being built across New York City may be searching for luxury, but in some cases they will find an unexpected perk: a break on real estate taxes that can mean tax bills as low as $96 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 56 Leonard Street, where a penthouse just went into contract for $47 million, the buyers are poised to receive a 76 percent break on their real estate taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 150 Charles Street, an ultraluxury development in the West Village, the tax break is 70 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And at One57, the 90-story skyscraper in Midtown where asking prices top $10,500 a square foot, the tax break is an eye-popping 94 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent review of the offering plans for some of the city's most expensive new apartment buildings offers an interesting peak into the perquisites and disadvantages of a lavish lifestyle. There are the windfalls, like the generous tax breaks, but there are also oft-overlooked expenses, like mandatory health club and dining-room fees, that can add to a buyer's bottom line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 56 Leonard Street, for example, the buyer who is in contract for the record-breaking penthouse would typically pay $140,000 a year in real estate taxes, according to estimates from the offering plan. But because the project laid its foundation in 2008 -- it stalled during the downturn and was resurrected only recently -- it was eligible to apply for a 10-year tax abatement. The city has given its preliminary approval, which means that when the building is completed, the penthouse buyer will pay just $33,000 annually for the first two years, with taxes progressively increasing through the remaining eight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax abatement, known as the 421A program, was established in the 1970s, during the depths of the city's financial crisis, to spur residential construction. In the 1980s, as the economy improved, the program was modified, and affordable-housing requirements were added. In 2008 it was substantially scaled back, although some buildings, like 56 Leonard, made it just under the wire to get the abatements by starting construction before the stricter rules went into effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The case for One57 is slightly more complex. Its location on West 57th Street would prohibit the developer from applying for the abatement, but in January the state legislature passed a broad housing bill that included an exemption for the building. The legislation gave a similar pass to several others, including 99 Church Street, otherwise known as 30 Park Place, an ultraluxury condominium that the developer Larry Silverstein is building in Lower Manhattan, and to a site owned by the developer Joseph Sitt at 516 Fifth Avenue in Midtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city has not yet signed off on the abatement, but if it does, a result will be an annual real estate tax bill of under $18,000 for the buyer of the penthouse at One57, assuming it sells for its $115 million list price. That tax bill would more typically apply to a $3 million apartment; for this penthouse, the typical bill would be nearly $300,0000, according to the offering plan. Similarly, the least expensive unit in the building, a 1,000-square-foot one-bedroom, has monthly taxes of just $96, which works out to $1,157 a year -- versus $19,234 without the tax break.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Yes, we allowed an exemption,'' said Senator Martin J. Golden, who sponsored the bill with Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright, ''but I am a proponent of the 421A program, and I believe it was the right thing to do.'' An Extell spokeswoman said in a statement that the legislation merely ''remedied an oversight'' in the 421A program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exemptions have given some market observers pause, particularly in the case of One57, which was already under way when the legislation was passed and presumably would have been built even without the tax break. ''The idea of the program was that tax subsidies can be an important tool to create residential housing and affordable housing that otherwise wouldn't be built,'' said Vicki Been, the faculty director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy. ''I don't see how giving a tax break to a building like One57 helps either of those goals.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some may question whether buyers of multimillion-dollar homes deserve breaks on city taxes, there is no doubt that the benefits are lucrative. But within the fine print of offering plans, which run hundreds of pages and are thick with dense legalese, hidden costs can also crop up. For example, at 432 Park Avenue, which will be the tallest condo in the Northern Hemisphere when it opens in 2015, full-floor penthouses are priced between $72.5 million and $95 million and will be saddled with common charges of more than $17,000 a month. The common charges are several times what the average New Yorker typically pays in rent, and they are most likely being underestimated, experts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Developers have been known to low-ball their estimated figures,'' said Aaron Shmulewitz, a partner at the law firm Belkin Burden Wenig &amp; Goldman. ''I've seen common charges increase 25 percent between the first year and the second year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On top of those costly common charges come fees like the mandatory membership in the building's gym, known as The Club at 432 Park Avenue, which bases its charges on the size of the apartment, with larger units owing more. Then there is the $2,000 that owners are required to pay annually toward the building's dining room, and the additional $1,200 in private dining services that owners are required to buy annually, whether or not they use the restaurant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The budgets included in offering plans can also be overly rosy, said lawyers. They typically cover just the first year of the condominium's operations, allowing developers to fudge important expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sponsors are motivated to have their budget seem as affordable as possible -- they shoot low, not high, in many instances,'' said Jeffrey S. Reich, a partner at Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman &amp; Herz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, developers often do not include the cost of maintenance contracts for elevators and other mechanicals, because most of the equipment is still under warranty. They also rarely allocate money to hire an engineer or a lawyer should there be construction defects, which are seldom discovered until a development is inhabited, Mr. Reich said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is even the risk that buyers could lose the views for which they have paid so dearly. Both 150 Charles Street and One57, for example, have apartments with ''lot line'' windows -- windows adjacent to neighboring buildings -- which may eventually have to be boarded up and removed if the neighboring buildings are expanded. In the case of One57, the developer estimates the cost of removing the windows at $5,000 per window, to be borne by the owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, while there are both risks and rewards in buying these exclusive properties, ''none of it should come as a shock to anyone who reads the offering plans,'' Mr. Reich said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even by New York City standards, Annette Suarez’s Manhattan apartment has a few drawbacks. It is a 408-square-foot one-bedroom and a fifth-floor walk-up. While it is nicely renovated, the miniature stainless steel refrigerator accommodated by its kitchen area is only hip-high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter. When the apartment was listed two months ago for $595,000, 55 people hoofed it up the stairs for the first and only open house. Seven offers and 10 days later, a contract was signed. Because, despite its flaws, Ms. Suarez’s apartment had something very powerful going for it, said one of her brokers, Christopher Kromer of Halstead Property [http://www.halstead.com/]: at the time, it was the only condominium for sale in the West Village for under $600,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment had no competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes for sale in and around New York City has fallen far behind demand, with inventory of apartments in Manhattan reaching the lowest levels in at least 13 years [http://www.elliman.com/reports-and-guides/reports/new-york-city/2q-2013-manhattan-sales/1-431]. With so few properties on the market, and so many buyers eager to lock in historically low interest rates before they climb any further, many “for sale” signs planted in a window or on the Web are greeted by a tidal wave of desperate buyers and frantic offers. And almost as quickly as they appear, those listings are gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In the last several decades of housing, the lack of supply hasn’t been seen on this scale,” said Jonathan Miller, president of the Miller Samuel [http://www.millersamuel.com/] appraisal firm. “No supply means frenzy, and it means prices rise.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price for a Manhattan apartment this spring was a stratospheric $1.425 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anthony Francavilla and his girlfriend had hoped to buy a two-family home in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, but gave up on that plan after encountering an open house crammed with perhaps 100 people, he said, and another with nearly two dozen offers already on the table. Another would-be buyer, John Clark, a corporate lawyer with a healthy down payment, lost out on at least two apartments because his bids were not all cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Michael Munn, a math professor looking to buy a studio in Brooklyn or downtown Manhattan, recently rushed back to the city in the middle of a Fire Island beach vacation to see a newly listed apartment, because he worried it would be gone by the time he got back just a few days later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Everybody was warning me how emotional it can become,” Mr. Munn said of the buying process. “It’s a huge purchase, it’s exciting and nerve-racking. But this is a whole different emotion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It felt very manic,” Mr. Munn said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was outbid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the economy crashed in 2008, financing for new residential projects all but evaporated, and for the next several years there were few new apartments to buy. But several other factors contributed to this scarcity as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight lending standards and low amounts of equity in some homes meant that many people could not afford to buy a new apartment, even if they sold the one they had. And powerful jitters about the economy in recent years — and last year, concerns about the so-called fiscal cliff — have persuaded many sellers to keep their homes off the market until calmer times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of 2012, Manhattan apartment inventory dropped to only 4,749 listings for sale, the lowest level seen since at least 2000, according to Miller Samuel, which prepares reports for <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, the real estate brokerage firm. In the second quarter of this year, that figure was only nominally higher, at 4,795 listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditionally, the spring is the busiest real estate season of the year, with a big bump in inventory and an influx of buyers who have waited through the winter for those homes to appear on the market. This year, however, that balancing of supply and demand did not happen, and what new listings there were became overwhelmed by a rush of buyers hoping to escape high rents and to catch low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We just put up a banner at 7 Harrison, and we have 120 people who have called already,” said Leonard Steinberg [http://theleonardsteinbergluxuryloftteam.elliman.com/], a managing director at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, of a sign that went up about three weeks ago on an unfinished condominium in TriBeCa. The building is still surrounded by scaffolding and Dumpsters, and from the street it appears to still be without windows and ceilings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not just Manhattan that is experiencing a scarcity of inventory. This phenomenon extends throughout much of New York City, especially in Brooklyn, where inventory fell 45.6 percent from the first quarter of 2012 to the first quarter of 2013, according to Miller Samuel. Across the country, the National Association of Realtors found that the inventory of existing single-family homes for sale fell by 9.2 percent from May 2012 to May 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many places, one step toward a solution would be to build new homes. But not in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are starting to see new projects that will come to market over the next couple of years, but the fact is that most of it will be very high-end,” said Pamela Liebman [http://www.corcoran.com/nyc/Agents/Display/7857], president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. Because of the high cost of land, she continued, “it’s the only way developers can finance these project.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller estimates that most residential development in Manhattan is now targeted at the top 10 percent of the market, which has started at around $3 million for the last four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scarcity creates an extraordinary climate for sellers. They are besieged by accommodating offers and all-cash bids, meaning the buyer does not apply for a mortgage, which takes time and sometimes falls through, especially if the appraised value is lower than the sale price. But sellers must also become buyers or renters themselves, so the very lack of inventory their listing would ease also helps to pin them in their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Sellers who would like to move, they can’t find anything either,” said Hall F. Willkie [http://www.bhsusa.com/about-hall-willkie], president of the real estate firm Brown Harris Stevens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of inventory is helping to push prices higher in Manhattan, though the rise is modest over all. The median apartment price for the borough in the second quarter of the year was $865,000, 4.3 percent higher than the same time last year, according to Miller Samuel. (Median prices are generally lower than averages because they are less influenced by very high-end sales.) But that figure is still far below the same period five years ago, in the period just before <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> collapsed, when the median price was $1.025 million, a difference of 15.6 percent. Tight credit and memories of the economic collapse are keeping buyers from drastically bidding up listings, real estate professionals said, and overpriced apartments tend to sit on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just shy of 36 percent of Manhattan sales that closed in the second quarter of this year sold at or above the asking price. Among sales that closed in the third quarter of 2008 — deals that were struck in the first half of that year, during the height of New York City’s housing boom — 51.6 percent of listings in Manhattan sold at a sum at least as high as the ask.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, in the face of much frenetic competition, many would-be buyers have decided to go another route; they are giving up. Like Jenna Weiss-Berman, for example, who spent nine months trying to buy an apartment in Brooklyn for a maximum of $475,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was horrible,” Ms. Weiss-Berman said. “It feels like buying real estate in New York is something rich people can do, and I was naïve to think it was something I could do, too.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So a few weeks ago, she started looking for a rental apartment instead. She and her girlfriend signed a lease for a place in Bedford-Stuyvesant, and they will move in this weekend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Weiss-Berman said that she has not felt so calm in months.</p>
<p>Annette Suarez, with her dog Chi Chi, listed her 408-square-foot one-bedroom apartment in the West Village for $595,000 two months. At the time, it was the only condominium for sale in the West Village for under $600,000. | Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Time Warner Inc</span>. has a tentative deal to move its headquarters farther west in Manhattan in what would be a major reshuffling meant to accelerate the long-awaited development of what is known as Hudson Yards while leaving Columbus Circle in the hunt for a defining corporate presence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company would move to an 80-story skyscraper to be built as part of the Hudson Yards project, at the railyards at 10th Avenue and 33rd Street, once an industrial neighborhood of warehouses, factories and tenements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it is approved by <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span>'s board this month, the deal will be a coup for Related Companies, the developer of the 26-acre Hudson Yards project as well as the <span class="companylink">Time Warner Center</span>, which combines a hotel, condominiums, luxury retail and office space at Columbus Circle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, an investment group led by Related is expected to pay <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> about $1.3 billion for the company's space at the two-tower <span class="companylink">Time Warner Center</span> complex. Under that agreement, <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> would lease its space at Columbus Circle for about five years, or until the new tower was completed. Related also plans to move its office to Hudson Yards from the <span class="companylink">Time Warner Center</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Time Warner</span>'s brokers, Douglas Harmon and Amy Spies of Eastdil Secured, have lined up a second buyer for its current space in case the company is unable to complete a final agreement with the Related group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They've found a new home,'' said one executive who had been briefed on the <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> deal but was not authorized to discuss it, ''and they found a winner for the old home.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the West Side deal, <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> would buy more than half the space in the 2.4-million-square-foot Hudson Yards tower, presumably to be renamed <span class="companylink">Time Warner Center</span>. <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span>, which is in the process of spinning off its magazine portfolio, <span class="companylink">Time Inc</span>., would move its executive suite to the new tower along with its HBO, Turner Networks, CNN and Warner Brothers offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives involved in the deal were reluctant to discuss it because the final papers had not been signed. But word of the pending deal has been coursing through the real estate industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, Related started work on a 47-story office tower in Hudson Yards, at the northwest corner of 30th Street and 10th Avenue, which will be home to Coach, the luxury retailer; <span class="companylink">L'Oreal USA</span>, the beauty products company; and SAP, the software company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it needed a corporate anchor for the second, larger tower to build the rest of the multiblock site on a platform over the railyard between 10th and 11th Avenues. The new complex would comprise the two office towers, a glass-walled luxury mall between them, a cultural institution, a 72-story residential building and a 60-story mixed-use tower with a hotel, office space and condominiums at the top.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related has been willing to sell its office space at cost to lure <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span>, one of the few corporations in the market for new space, and get the rest of the complex under way. The developer expects to make money on the retail and residential portions of the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related and its partner, Oxford Property Group, are now betting that <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span>'s move to Hudson Yards will establish the area as a new commercial district, much the way the company transformed Columbus Circle when it moved there a decade ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related is currently building a residential building nearby and closing on a separate parcel at 33rd Street and 11th Avenue. It also has the rights to build over the adjacent railyard between 11th and 12th Avenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Related expects that companies will leap at the chance to pay a premium for the old <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> office space at Columbus Circle, and presumably, the opportunity to put its own name on the high-profile complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But large companies have moved cautiously in the current market, making many developers squirm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey L. Bewkes, <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span>'s chairman and chief executive, first signaled his plans in 2011 to consolidate the company's operations in a modern, highly efficient, albeit less luxurious, tower by 2017, when many of the company's leases expire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> hired the brokerage firm Studley to look for a new home, touching off a frenzy among the city's top developers, including <span class="companylink">Boston Properties</span>, Extell Development and <span class="companylink">Brookfield Properties</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — Americans spent more in May as their income rose, encouraging signs after a slow start to the year. But spending was weaker in April, February and January than previously estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said on Thursday that consumer spending rose 0.3 percent last month, nearly erasing a decline of similar size in April. Income rose 0.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers, benefiting from low inflation, spent more at retail businesses in May, notably for cars, home improvements and sporting goods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another bright spot, the number of people who signed contracts to buy homes in the United States jumped in May to the highest level in more than six years, a sign home sales will probably rise in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_association_of_realtors/index.html?inline=nyt-org] said Thursday that its seasonally adjusted index for pending home sales rose 6.7 percent to 112.3 last month. That is the highest level since December 2006. Signed contracts have risen 12.1 percent in the last 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase could reflect an effort by potential buyers to complete deals before mortgage rates rise further. Mortgage rates rose in May and then jumped after the Federal Reserve[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/f/federal_reserve_system/index.html?inline=nyt-org] chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, suggested last week that the Fed could slow its bond purchases later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase points to healthy gains in home sales in the coming months. There is generally a one- to two-month lag between a signed contract and a completed sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The activity report should provide comfort as it shows that housing is still holding on, said Jennifer Lee, an economist at BMO Capital Markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, rising rates could weigh on demand later this year. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage soared this week to 4.46 percent, the highest in nearly two years, according to a report Thursday by the mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. But rates are still low by historical standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Despite the rise in mortgage rates and house prices, housing affordability will still be well above its long-term average,” said Joseph LaVorgna, an economist at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>.</p>

</div><div class="author">By ANN CARRNS   </div><div>634 words</div><div>28 June 2013</div><div>NYT Blogs</div><div>NYTB</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates have been rising, making it a bit more expensive to borrow to buy a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices [http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/business/economy/home-sales-are-rising-and-so-are-prices.html]have been on the upswing, as well. (The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span> Case-Shiller home price index showed a 12 percent gain in home prices in 20 cities from April 2012 to April 2013.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some perspective is warranted. Mortgage rates are still historically low — they’re expected to hover around 4 percent for the second half of the year, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. (The average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 3.93 percent last week; a year ago, the average was 3.71 percent).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while home prices are rising, they are still relatively affordable. According to a <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> statement on June 18, “At today’s house prices and income levels, mortgage rates would have to be nearly 7 percent” before the typically priced home would be unaffordable for most families making a typical income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jed Kolko, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, a real-estate site, wrote in a recent blog post [http://trends.truliablog.com/2013/06/mortgage-rates-rent-vs-buy/]that despite the recent upswing in mortgage rates, the cost of owning a home is still low when compared to the main alternative: renting. In most markets, he argued, buying is cheaper than renting, and it will remain so until mortgage rates move significantly higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To see how much rates would have to rise before it becomes cheaper to rent, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> updated its “rent vs. buy” analysis to reflect home prices and rents (based on properties listed for sale and for rent on <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>) from March, April and May. The result? Rates would have to rise to an average of 10.5 percent before the scales tip in favor of renting nationally, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some markets where home prices are much higher, like many cities in California, the calculated “tipping point” is much lower. In San Francisco and San Jose, rates have to climb just over 5 percent to make renting more attractive. In New York and New Jersey, the tipping point comes around 7 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While such rent vs. buy comparisons can be informative, they are, by necessity, made using a series of assumptions, which may or may not reflect your personal financial situation, said Daniel McCue, research manager at the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University[http://www.jchs.harvard.edu/].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, he noted, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>’s calculator assumes a 20 percent down payment. For a $200,000 home, that is $40,000 — an amount the typical renter is unlikely to have handy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site’s rental listings also may not capture many individual apartments owned by smaller landlords, which may be less expensive than large, investor-owned apartment complexes, he noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysis also assumes that the buyer will stay in the home for seven years and so will &nbsp; benefit from a modest appreciation in price. But if you are young and mobile, you aren’t necessarily going to stay in a house that long — so you lose out on the chance to earn back closing costs and other home-buying expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(A complete list of the calculation’s assumptions[http://info.trulia.com/rentvsbuy] is available on <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>’s Web site).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, rent vs. buy calculations can help track trends, but it’s hard to say that there is a single, magic number where home buying must be cheaper than renting — for you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are rising mortgage rates affecting your decision to buy a home? Do you think continuing to rent makes sense?</p>

</div><div class="author">By SHAILA DEWAN   </div><div>1173 words</div><div>27 June 2013</div><div>International Herald Tribune</div><div>INHT</div><div>15</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates may be inching up, but they have not put a damper on the U.S. housing market’s rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly data from the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span>/Case-Shiller home price index, released Tuesday, showed a 12 percent increase in prices in 20 cities from April 2012 to April 2013, the largest gain since early 2006, when home values began to level off in advance of the market collapse. The rate of new-home sales also picked up to its quickest pace since July 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gains added to months of stronger showings in housing, a market that can infuse the economy with spending on big-ticket items like furniture and dishwashers. But the data released Tuesday covered a period before comments made last week by Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, caused a further jump in interest rates, raising fears that the market’s momentum could stall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, many housing experts shrugged off that concern, noting that the effect of a single factor like mortgage rates would be tempered by other forces like prices, wages and changes in employment. Moreover, any increase in interest rates could cut both ways, with some potential buyers encouraged to try to make deals sooner to get ahead of further increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, though, the biggest factor in the market, real estate agents say, is a low number of homes for sale, and that did not change after the Fed’s announcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘For our low-$100,000 buyer, it’s almost impossible to find a house right now,’’ said Renae Jackson, an agent in Houston, recounting a flurry of bidding wars. She acknowledged that if mortgage rates increased too much it would cause a pullback but said she believed ‘‘whoever it is’’ who controls interest rates would be cautious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘I don’t think they’re going to take it that high that fast — they don’t want to see the economy crash again,’’ she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates are not specifically under the control of the Federal Reserve, and they are subject to a wide variety of market forces. But they remain near historical lows, and home prices are still well below their peaks in most markets, meaning that housing is still relatively affordable for many Americans. Stuart A. Miller, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., one of the country’s top home builders, credited recent gains to an improving economy, pent-up demand and a severe housing shortage after so little was built during the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Inventories are low for both new and existing homes, as well as for rentals,’’ said Mr. Miller, whose company reported a 53 percent rise in revenue in the second quarter compared with the same period a year earlier. ‘‘The monthly payment math continues to push families to find a way to purchase.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home values are 11.7 percent below their peak in the mid-2000s, according to a home price report by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> that tracks mortgages, and more than 25 percent below their peak, according to Case-Shiller, which includes all-cash purchases in its calculations. If mortgage rates rise to 4 percent by the end of the year, as the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> forecasts, they will still be much lower than the rates most Americans have experienced over the last few decades. In May, the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage stood at 3.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For budget-conscious buyers, a return to a more historically normal 6 percent interest rate would make a significant difference. The monthly payment on a $300,000 mortgage would be about $460 more at 6 percent than at 3.5 percent. But such buyers could still turn to alternatives like adjustable-rate mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leah Berk, a business school student who is searching for a condominium in the Boston-area town of Brookline, said she was much more concerned about finding the right property than about rising mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘I’m really at the beginning of my search, so I’m not looking at the interest rates super-duper carefully,’’ she said. ‘‘My parents, when they bought their house 30 years ago, the interest rates were 17 percent. So with that in mind, if I can get an interest rate that’s 4 or 4.5 percent, that’s fine.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home prices are bound to soften if mortgage rates keep rising, at this point in a recovering market, rising prices and even rising mortgage rates are likely to help rather than hurt. In the short term, both may push the undecided to step up their timetable to catch rates and prices before they rise further. In the big picture, they provide some assurance that a house may once again be a prudent investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several analysts warned that the steep price gains of recent months would slow in the second half of the year, in part because of rising interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Today’s Case-Shiller numbers may reflect where the housing market has been in some of the frothier metros, but they are not indicative of where it’s headed,’’ said Stan Humphries, the chief economist at Zillow, a real estate Web site. ‘‘The housing market worm has turned over the past few weeks.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Schiff, the chief executive of the brokerage firm Euro Pacific Capital and one of the few who foresaw the housing bust, said that low interest rates were creating another bubble that was outpacing wage growth and putting housing out of the reach of many potential buyers. At the same time, he said, prices might fall again if homeowners who have been waiting for a recovery and investors who have been buying up houses are tempted to sell to take advantage of current conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller figures, which track prices in 20 markets, show a wide variety across the country. While the average increase was 12.1 percent, houses in the New York metropolitan area were up only 3.2 percent over the year, while homes in San Francisco rose a sharp 23.9 percent. Some of the markets that were hit hardest during the recession produced some of the largest one-year gains, with Atlanta, Detroit and Las Vegas each rising around 20 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Angeles showed a gain of nearly 19 percent over the last 12 months, while Boston, Chicago and Denver were closer to 10 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>, which issued its own price index report Tuesday, reported its strongest gains in the western part of the United States and the weakest in New England and the mid-Atlantic region. The agency, which looks at all mortgages sold or guaranteed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, said prices were up 7.4 percent in April over the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate survey, new homes were selling at a rate of 476,000 a year in May, up 2.1 percent from April, the Commerce Department reported.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, it was the Japanese. Moneymen from Tokyo blew into the United States to buy famous pieces of the American landscape, from Rockefeller Center in New York to the Pebble Beach Golf Links in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, about a quarter-century later, another set of deep-pocketed foreign buyers is pushing ever deeper into United States real estate: the Chinese.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undaunted by Japan's real estate misadventures in the 1980s -- some Japanese investors wildly overpaid for United States property, and Japan eventually suffered one of the biggest property market collapses in history -- Chinese investors are fanning out in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What began with a few isolated purchases two years ago has become a hunt for trophy properties and billion-dollar deals. So far, the kind of fears that arose in the 1980s -- unfounded talk that Japan was ''buying up'' America -- have not surfaced this time. To the contrary, the Chinese, or at least their money, are being welcomed, even celebrated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some caution that China could quickly retreat, as Japan did, if its economy worsens. Signs of economic weakness in China have been mounting, and the country's financial system has recently come under stress. Those concerns could dissipate if Beijing steps in to ease strains in the nation's banking industry and to spur growth, but many economists see real and growing dangers within China's economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet in recent weeks, several big deals in New York City have set real estate circles abuzz. Zhang Xin, a Chinese business magnate and chief executive of the largest commercial real estate developer in Beijing, joined forces with the Safra family of Brazil to buy a large piece of the General Motors Building in Midtown. <span class="companylink">Dalian Wanda Group</span>, a big Chinese developer, said it intended to build a luxury hotel in Manhattan. (Wanda is also planning to build a hotel in London.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deals go beyond shimmering glass-and-steel towers: Chinese and Hong Kong investors have also become the second-largest foreign buyers of United States homes, after the Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're just getting started,'' said Steve Collins, the international director at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> Capital, a real estate services firm that recently held conferences for potential buyers in Shanghai and Beijing. ''There's just been some incredible wealth creation there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the moment, the Chinese government is encouraging the investments and even helping to finance them. The state-owned Bank of China has become the largest foreign lender in commercial real estate deals in the United States, replacing big European banks. Beijing is eager to diversify its investments. The Chinese government owns more than $1 trillion of United States Treasury securities, but those investments generate little return given how low interest rates are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The political support for investments beyond U.S. Treasuries has increased significantly over the last couple of years and that has encouraged Chinese investors to look at real estate in big, stable markets like New York or other big cities,'' said Thilo Hanemann, a research director the Rhodium Group, a firm that analyzes global business and economic trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese aren't limiting themselves to megadeals. Some purchases have been relatively small by the standards of commercial real estate. Ms. Zhang, who is the chief executive of SOHO China and one of the richest women in the world, paid about $600 million in 2011 for a 49 percent stake in the Park Avenue Plaza, a Midtown Manhattan skyscraper. That same year, the real estate arm of the <span class="companylink">HNA Group</span>, a Chinese airline company, saved an office building at 1180 Sixth Avenue from foreclosure for $265 million. HNA also bought the boutique Cassa Hotel in Times Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese investors or firms have also bought large hotels in California, including the Sheraton Universal in Universal City; the Crowne Plaza in Burlingame, near the San Francisco airport; and the Hilton Ontario in Ontario. They have also purchased a riverfront parcel in Toledo, Ohio, and, earlier this year, an office building in Morristown, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese firms and investors are also betting that the potential returns in American commercial property markets will be higher than in other areas of the world. The market for office, industrial and retail property appears to have bottomed out. Office vacancy rates have fallen and rent prices have stabilized amid signs of economic improvement. And while competition is heating up -- three Manhattan office buildings have sold for more than $1 billion so far this year -- many of the big bidders and lenders from Europe have pulled back as their home economies struggle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to buying commercial real estate, China is emerging as a powerful force in financing other players' deals. In particular, the Bank of China, China's premier lender and one of the country's four major state-run banks, has assumed an increasingly large role. ''A few years ago, the U.S. branches of German banks were the top three or four foreign lenders for commercial property deals, now it's the Bank of China,'' said Matthew Anderson, a managing director at Trepp L.L.C., a data and analytics firm that tracks bank lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese development firms are also lining up large United States commercial real estate projects. In February, <span class="companylink">China Vanke</span>, a development company, made its first North American investment when it formed a joint venture with Tishman Speyer to build luxury condominiums in San Francisco. Another Chinese developer has agreed to provide funding for a $1.5 billion project that will transform 65 industrial acres in Oakland, Calif., into a waterfront neighborhood with 3,100 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the Chinese have even arrived in hipster central: Williamsburg, Brooklyn. A Chinese firm has purchased a site and plans to build a 216-unit condo project there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts say the Chinese money flowing directly into real estate pales in comparison with the money that is moving through private investments or real estate funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, <span class="companylink">China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange</span>, which manages foreign exchange reserves, agreed to invest $500 million in a $13 billion real estate fund overseen by the <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span>, a Wall Street investment firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's main sovereign wealth fund, the <span class="companylink">China Investment Corporation</span>, has taken direct stakes in properties but has also invested more billions of dollars in real estate funds overseen by large private investment funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The overwhelming majority of Chinese capital is getting into the commercial property market through third parties,'' said Dan Fasulo, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. ''They're getting billions of dollars into the system almost unnoticed.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDCredit our plutocrats and the real estate developers who adore them with this: No financial advantage is too small for them to pursue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest evidence that our developers scour sidewalks for pennies might be found at the 90-story ziggurat known as One57, with his-and-her bathrooms, super deep freeze, titanium-reinforced views that reach to the Arctic, or at least Putnam County. The <span class="companylink">Extell Development Company</span> recently sold a 14,000-square-foot penthouse (but does it have enough closets?) to a hedge-fund billionaire for $90 million. Bargain flats are still to be found at $18 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Barnett of Extell paid $1.3 billion or so to put up this obelisk on 57th Street and will emerge holding great sacks of profits. Yet none of this gave him pause in his pursuit of a 10-year property tax exemption -- known as the 421-a program -- for this same project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seven years ago, the New York State Legislature ruled out tax breaks for Midtown Manhattan developments unless they included affordable units; reformers noted reasonably that there was no shortage of construction cranes and fortunes to be had in that neighborhood. In all, 150,000 units in New York City receive the 421-a property tax abatements, for $1.1 billion in lost revenue for the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever. A subsidy is like catnip for a developer; the more difficult the pursuit, the more glorious the catch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barnett and four princeling developers joined the Real Estate Board of New York last year, spreading a thick green carpet of cash for politicians, at least $1.5 million. (To peruse their donation lists is to glory in nonpartisan giving: the governor, the attorney general, the state party organizations that have proved so corrupt of late, and any politician, Republican or Democrat, who possessed the simple wit to create a ''Friends of ... '' committee -- all are awash in the developers' cash.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is known as fertilizing a field. Spread manure and, voilà!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impossible proves porously possible. In January, State Senator Martin J. Golden, Republican of Brooklyn, and Assemblyman Keith Wright, Democrat of Manhattan, attached a gilded little 421-a ''carve-out'' to the underside of a much-needed housing bill for New York City. The vast majority of legislators voted for it. Just like that, Mr. Barnett's development earned a property tax exemption worth at least $50 million, maybe much more, over the next 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barnett's fellow developers, including Larry Silverstein and Joseph Sitt (who tried hard to ruin Coney Island before selling his holdings and walking away with a golden pile) stand to make tens of millions of dollars in subsidies for their developments. The Metropolitan Council on Housing detailed this in its report ''Tax Breaks for Billionaires''; <span class="companylink">Common Cause</span> New York also investigated the political giving; and The Daily News contributed fine reporting last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cumulatively, the exempted property taxes could pay to keep the city's libraries open for a sixth day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State Senator Liz Krueger watches such unneeded tax subsidies -- for energy, insurance, tobacco and luxury development -- slip like barges down a darkened canal. She notes that the housing bill ''was held hostage so a few well-connected developers could rob taxpayers to the tune of millions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps we should admire the gumption of our developers. They often argue that without tax breaks, the city would be a desert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in this case, the property tax exemption arrives as the Extell tower, a dull sheath of blue glass that spirals above the skyline like an exercise in ego architecture, is near completion. Mr. Barnett has been blessed with a retroactive tax break. ''A tax incentive given retroactively is the stupidest thing in the world,'' notes Senator Krueger, with a tone suggesting that she's becoming expert in the stupidest things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assemblyman Wright, who represents Harlem, did not return a phone call. Several of his fellow legislators occupied themselves last week trying to pass another such tax break.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assemblyman Joseph R. Lentol, Democrat of Brooklyn, sponsored a bill to retroactively extend tax breaks to developers who had converted old factories into luxury lofts. That bill passed the State Senate. Alas, it foundered in the Assembly. And that, he noted, broke the hearts of a few developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Was this proposed tax break for these properties a good thing or not? I can't say,'' Mr. Lentol said. ''I don't have enough knowledge to say it's a good thing or bad thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if legislators don't ask, why should anyone else?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: June 26, 2013, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Gotham column on Tuesday, about developers of luxury buildings who are seeking tax breaks, misstated the vote margin on a state housing bill that included a property tax break of at least $50 million for a 90-story building on 57th Street in New York City known as One57. The vote was 56 to 7 in the State Senate, and 139 to 7 in the Assembly; not every legislator voted for the bill.</p>

</div><div class="author">By GRAHAM BOWLEY </div><div>705 words</div><div>20 June 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span>, the auction house that has for centuries put other people's treasures up for sale, is in the early days of exploring whether it should place one of its own on the block: its glittering glass-and-granite-fronted worldwide headquarters on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has hired two real estate firms to weigh a possible sale. One, Eastdil Secured, is seeking out buyers for the 10-story building, at York Avenue and 72nd Street; the other, <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, will evaluate where <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> could operate next were it to sell its home, which it has occupied for more than 30 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are looking at our options,'' said Andrew Gully, <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> worldwide director of communications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exploration of a possible sale, which was first reported by The New York Post, includes a sale-and-lease-back option that would give the company time to consider its next move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 490,000-square-foot building, which takes up the entire front of the York Avenue block between 71st and 72nd streets, is in a prime neighborhood known for luxury residential towers and a corridor of hospitals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the city's robust real estate market, <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> has already fielded unsolicited overtures, Mr. Gully said, without specifying further details. As a public company, the auction house had a duty to explore a possible sale, he said. That decision, he added, was not motivated by a thirst for capital and should not be interpreted as a signal that the heart of Manhattan's art market has shifted elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the building, which houses <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> headquarter offices and auction space, is vast and near the Upper East Side art galleries, much of the activity in the New York art market has long since moved to other areas like Chelsea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a long-term decision that has nothing to do with short-term results or sales,'' Mr. Gully said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first quarter of this year, <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> reported a 3 percent decline in revenue from a year earlier and a net loss of $22.3 million, after auction commission margins were squeezed. That followed a 37 percent decline in net income to $108.3 million in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christie's, the rival auction house, said it had no plans to move from its New York headquarters, at 20 Rockefeller Plaza, which it rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built in 1925 as a cigar factory and functioning as a <span class="companylink">Kodak</span> warehouse beginning in 1949, the York Avenue building was first occupied by <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> in 1980. Around 2000 the auction house bought the building for $11 million and completed a $140 million expansion and renovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by then, a federal investigation of a price-fixing conspiracy between <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> and Christie's was under way as well as an array of related lawsuits. The affair, culminating in a trial of Sotheby's former chairman and principal owner, Alfred Taubman, drained <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> of cash, and the company sold the building in 2002 for $175 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It leased it back from the buyer, the real estate RFR Holding, and in 2009 it repurchased it for $370 million. At the time, it assumed the existing mortgage of $235 million and paid $135 million in cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas Harmon of Eastdil Secured said the property was of ''trophy quality.'' ''It is a beautiful building in a very good location,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He described it as ''a blank canvas'' that would be perfect for hospital or office use -- or even for knocking down to build a new residential tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He suggested that <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> could capture a ''sell-high-buy-low moment'' by selling at a peak price while taking advantage of leasing prices that are still relatively low at some developments in the city where the auction house would be welcomed as a prime tenant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harmon recently handled the sale of the 37-story Sony Building, on Madison Avenue at 55th Street, to a consortium for $1.1 billion.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Making Energy Efficiency Attractive For Owners of Older Seattle Buildings</span>
</div><div class="author">By FELICITY BARRINGER </div><div>947 words</div><div>19 June 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For commercial building owners, energy-efficiency improvements have had modest appeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Switching to less power-hungry light bulbs is relatively easy, and the payoff relatively swift. But replacing furnaces or boilers or reconfiguring the building's shell involves sinking millions of dollars into an asset that the owner may want to get rid of long before the investment has paid off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a new twist, some investors, a technology company, a municipal utility and an environmentally oriented foundation have joined forces to show that major energy-efficiency improvements in commercial buildings may provide alluring new revenue to all involved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A program at the <span class="companylink">Bullitt Foundation</span>'s new building in Seattle is aimed at attracting the notice of commercial building owners around the country who may be reluctant to make heavy investments in such technologies. Under this plan, if they, or investors, put in the capital for major efficiency retrofits, new revenue, based on precise measurements of energy savings, will keep coming in for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, building owners, utilities and utility regulators who underwrite some efficiency measures remain somewhat skeptical of what are called ''deep retrofits,'' like swapping out furnaces, boilers or the building shell itself. This has been particularly true for older, smaller commercial buildings, which, according to a new report, account for 47 percent of all commercial real estate outside the world of malls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Seattle City Light</span>, a municipal utility, has agreed to the long-term purchase of energy savings from the <span class="companylink">Bullitt Foundation</span>, whose new building is known for being ultra-thrifty with water and power. The savings will be measured by a new software program from EnergyRM, using a new kind of meter that will, from one day to the next, track and verify how much savings have occurred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a whole new frontier,'' said Brett Phillips, the chief sustainability officer of Unico Partners, based in Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Traditionally commercial real estate and how we go about paying for products is very conventional,'' he said. ''Change is hard to come by. The more we can innovate our financial instruments, the better.'' But he cautioned that the Bullitt Center's experiment would have to show real results before even he, a businessman working in an environmentally conscious setting, would be persuaded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The basic plan intends to ensure that utilities lose none of the revenue that supports their fixed costs -- wires and other infrastructure -- while allowing them access to a new power source. The energy not used by Bullitt or any other building is purchased by the utility in a 30-year contract, just as if they were purchasing hydropower or coal-fired electricity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And how does unused electricity get its value? The building has already paid market rates for the unused kilowatt-hours. Seattle Power and Light buys them back for resale, paying for what were christened ''nega-watts'' more than three decades ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the calculations for Bullitt are still being worked out, the working estimate is they will use about one-third of the electricity a new building constructed to city codes would use -- a saving of more than 500,000 kilowatt-hours annually. For that savings, <span class="companylink">Seattle City Light</span> would pay about $44,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The utility was not easy to convince. As ''Disruptive Challenges,'' a recent report from the <span class="companylink">Edison Electric Institute</span> shows, the industry is getting increasingly nervous about its long-term ability to finance its infrastructure costs in a new world of efficiency and renewable energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Jorge Carrasco, the superintendent of Seattle City Light, explained it, any utility executive must think ''about what does this new approach do from a financial standpoint to an entity that makes its living by selling energy?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, ''this program ties the savings to performance,'' It ensures, he said, that ''you don't pay any incentive until you realize the savings.'' The building owner continues to pay the full retail rates they would have paid before the retrofit, ensuring that the utility has cash up front to pay its fixed costs; if the owner himself invests in major efficiencies, he shares in the revenue from the long-term contract for his ''nega-watts.'' Or the investors do. Or both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For investors, a guarantee of a long-term payment from a financially stable municipal or investor-owned utility is supposed to make the cost of capital cheaper, because the risk is lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Campbell, a principal at Equilibrium Capital, a San Francisco investment group, said, ''Utilities are regulated to be an investment-grade credit.'' The solidity of this backing, he said, makes assembling capital, ''a much simpler and more straightforward task and therefore one that costs less.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the investors are banking on the creditworthiness of the utility, <span class="companylink">Seattle City Light</span> is banking on the accuracy of the metering software developed by Energy Resource Management, a Portland company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every external factor affecting a baseline established by the meter -- a week that is warmer or wetter than the same week in earlier years or an energy-intensive tenant moving out and a low-energy company moving in -- is supposed to be accounted for. The metering software is a virtual accountant making sure the efficiency calculations are correct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denis Hayes, president of the Bullitt Foundation, argued, ''The powerful thing about this proposal is that it works best for existing buildings.'' Given the turnover of commercial building space is less than 2.5 percent a year, it is the old buildings that could produce the greatest savings.</p>

</div><div class="author">By ANN CARRNS   </div><div>578 words</div><div>19 June 2013</div><div>NYT Blogs</div><div>NYTB</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are credit cards that offer cash-back rewards for goals as diverse as travel and saving for college. Now, as the housing market rebounds, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> is stepping up its promotion of a card that can help borrowers pay down their home loan faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Home Rebate card[https://www.wellsfargo.com/credit-cards/home-rebate/] has been around for a few years, but <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> thinks customers interested in reducing their mortgage debt may have renewed interest in the offering. <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, which says it makes one in every three home loans in the country, first introduced its Home Rebate credit card in 2007, at the start of the housing bust, when it was offered to new mortgage applicants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that home sales are reviving, Wells is revving up marketing of the card, not only to new loan applicants, who stand to reap longer-term benefits, but also to existing <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> borrowers. (The card is only available to <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> mortgage holders, and some loans — like commercial loans, certain second mortgages and reverse mortgages — aren’t eligible.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea is that customers can earn cash back for goods they are going to purchase anyway, and use it to reduce their home loan balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Customers don’t like to carry debt, and there’s de-leveraging going on,” said Brent Vallat, head of <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>’s credit card, lines and loans group. He said he isn’t aware of another credit card that dedicates cash back rewards to the holder’s mortgage principal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(American Banker, which recently reported on the Home Rebate card, said <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> offered a similar card more than a decade ago, but it has been discontinued).</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a move that may enrage those who enjoy a cigarette on their couch after work, but delight air-freshener-wielding neighbors, a major landlord has banned smoking in all of its apartments across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of this month, the Related Companies has decided that tenants can no longer light up in the 40,000 rental units it owns or manages. The edict, which builds on an effort that began for Related with a handful of its New York buildings in 2009, is meant to create healthier living conditions, company officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the program will roll out gradually, it appears to be the first of this scale by a national property owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also seems likely to create controversy. Where past efforts against smoking have focused on public gathering places -- like bars, stadiums and courthouses -- Related is now trying to prohibit legal private behavior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that smokers will get kicked to the curb right away. New tenants must sign a contract promising not to smoke anywhere in the building, including their private terraces or balconies. If they break the rules, they can be evicted. But those already renting will not face the same fate until after they renew their leases and sign the no-smoking contract. With a turnover rate of 10,000 a year, Related's apartments could conceivably be smoke-free in a few years' time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics point out that tenants could always lie about their habit, and hide it successfully. Also, it can be very difficult to evict tenants -- especially those whose rents are regulated, as they have strong protections and guaranteed lease renewals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some smokers -- and even nonsmokers -- worry about privacy infringement and say Related is overreaching. ''It's just mean,'' said Polina Skoch, a resident of Related's One Union Square South, who smokes half a pack of Marlboros a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though she signed her lease earlier and is out of the immediate line of fire, Ms. Skoch said she worried about the ''Big Brother'' vibe that the changes could facilitate, because Related will mostly rely on neighbors to report on neighbors. ''I thought it couldn't get any worse when the city banned smoking in parks,'' she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Jeffrey I. Brodsky, the president of Related Management, says people can't expect such freedoms in an apartment building, where resources are shared. ''It's not unlike somebody playing their tuba at two in the morning and compromising their neighbors' efforts to enjoy their apartments,'' he said. ''There's an expectation of certain behavior.'' As for the increasingly trendy smokeless cigarettes, Related says that because they don't emit plumes, they aren't banned -- although ''we reserve our right to adjust our program if they become known as hazardous to others,'' a spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail. Related's condominiums won't be affected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many studies have proved that secondhand smoke, which is cited as the reason for most smoking bans, is a health hazard. What's less obvious is how much smoke actually seeps from one apartment to the next. In New York last year, for instance, the 311 complaint line received 1,340 calls about smoke from other apartments. To put that in perspective, calls to 311 last year totaled 19.4 million, and 127,607 of them were complaints about noise from neighbors, officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, fewer adults are smoking in New York. In 2002, according to the city health department, the rate was 22 percent; in 2011 it was 15 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the cause of that decline or just a coincidence, a raft of policies in the last decade have greatly limited where people can smoke. In New York, smoking was snuffed out in restaurants in 2002 and on beaches and in city parks in 2011; last year, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said he wanted every building, including co-ops and condos, to draft a smoking policy, whether pro or con, which some saw as encouraging bans on apartment smoking. The mayor also hopes to set limits on who can smoke: in April, officials unveiled a plan to raise the age limit for cigarette purchases to 21 from 18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On some of its tactics, New York City has company. In recent years several cities and towns in California have banned smoking in apartments; San Rafael did so last fall. And in Sacramento this spring, a bill was introduced to ban smoking in multifamily housing statewide -- although it was scuttled by concerns about the feasibility of enforcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the fact remains that not everybody is convinced the only way to deal with smoking complaints is to ban smoking. Donald Erwin, a principal of Erwin &amp; Bielinski, an architecture and engineering firm, said a minor renovation might be enough to remedy secondhand smoke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the last real estate boom, he explained, many people in condos and co-ops cut into buffering wall space when expanding their apartments, making it easier for secondhand smoke to travel. Also, newer condos often have thinner walls than century-old buildings, which explains why their tenants complain more frequently about smoking, said Mr. Erwin. He added that putting proper insulation inside walls, and seals around lights, can keep smoke out. ''It can be incredibly simple to fix,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some property managers, too, favor a less extreme approach than bans, like air purification systems, said Enid Hamelin, a spokeswoman for Lawrence Properties, which manages 65 buildings in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Whether it's ethnic cooking, candles or incense,'' Ms. Hamelin said, ''we handle it the same way. You try very hard to avoid people getting emotional, try to handle it as Solomon-esque as you can.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2009, when Related began its antismoking program at TriBeCa Green in Battery Park City and the Sierra in Chelsea, courts have generally supported the legality of smoking bans in apartment buildings, lawyers say. With market-rate units, landlords can kick smokers out simply by deciding not to renew leases. But Related's buildings have many rent-regulated units, including more than 4,000 in New York. Lawyers said protections like guaranteed lease renewals would make it difficult to evict smokers from these kinds of affordable apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, at least, bans have rarely led to evictions. There haven't been any in the dozens of buildings managed by Pan Am Equities since it imposed a smoking ban in 2008, said David Iwanier, a vice president of the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only a single person has left 1510 Lexington Avenue, owned by Kenbar Management in East Harlem, where smoking is banned not only in the apartments but also on adjacent sidewalks, said Kinne Yon, a Kenbar principal. But that person, a cigar smoker, moved out voluntarily after just a few days, and got his security deposit back, Ms. Yon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Mr. Iwanier and Ms. Yon acknowledged, however, that smokers may avoid their buildings in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-ops are like rentals, in that rules can be passed by a majority of the co-op board, although a ban attempted by Lincoln Towers, the 452-unit Upper West Side complex, failed in 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condos are trickier, because bans usually require a change in bylaws, which means two-thirds of residents need to approve them. ''And good luck getting a group of New Yorkers to agree on anything,'' said Adam Leitman Bailey, a real estate lawyer who has handled several smoking cases. He added that if a building has unsold units controlled by the developer, who gets a vote for each one of them, the developer may decide to vote against a ban, so as not to limit the buyer pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the 32-story Ariel West, a condo on the Upper West Side, banned smoking in 2011. Fines are $150 for the first offense and go up by $150 for each one that follows. And last winter, the 98-unit One Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn banned smoking in all spaces except for private terraces and its roof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This spring, after a few years of deliberation, Zeckendorf Towers, a 670-unit full-block development at Union Square, also put a ban in place, staking a claim as the largest apartment complex in the country to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And with that kind of momentum on its side, Related is also acting in a favorable economic climate. Vacancy rates are low in many cities, which means that even limiting the applicant pool should not hurt the company's ability to fill up its buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the recession, demand slackened everywhere, which delayed rollout of the initial ban. ''There were a lot of other exigencies in the marketplace for a while,'' Mr. Brodsky said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the plan, Related will also ban smoking in its new rental buildings; one of them, 500 West 30th Street at 10th Avenue, a 386-unit rental, is to open next year in the Hudson Yards neighborhood. Outside New York, soon-to-be-completed projects include Ocean Avenue South in Santa Monica, Calif.; 111 West Wacker Drive in Chicago; and 100 Arlington Street in Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether smokers will decide to quit in order to live in a Related building, or simply go somewhere else, remains to be seen. But Mark Panzarino, an artist who also lives at One Union Square South, strongly supports what his landlord is doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Coming here and wanting to smoke would be like asking for meat at a vegetarian restaurant,'' he said. ''It's just something you're not allowed to do.''</p>
<p>Those already renting from Related can light up until their leases expire, but new tenants must sign a contract promising not to smoke, even inside their own units. (PHOTOGRAPH BY TONY CENICOLA/THE NEW YORK TIMES) (RE9) </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interview conducted and condensed by</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VIVIAN MARINO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Your predecessor, Brandon Moore, served as C.E.O. for less than a year. Will you be sticking around for a while?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Well, I hope to stick around. My predecessor was brought in to do mechanical things — conversion testing on the Web site — and then I’ve been brought in to grow from here. It was always going to be short for him; he was brought in to make some adjustments, which he did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What changes have you been making since taking the he lm?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. RealtyTrac has a history of aggregating data. We were using that data for all sorts of things — probably too broad of a focus — and the goal has been to narrow the focus but take bigger swings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How so ?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We’re just focused on our two core competencies, which is: get more data and get it out there to more people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We’ve gotten rid of the business divisions that weren’t as profitable. Those include certain advertising areas — advertising that wasn’t making sense, referral fees that weren’t making sense. Bottom line: We were negative a few years ago and now we’re in good, positive territory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. So business has turned around .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. 2012 was a very profitable year; 2013 is on pace to be the most profitable in the history of this company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How much have profits increased ?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I would probably get in a little bit of trouble if I said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Has there ever been any discussion about taking the company public ?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Anything’s on the table. Of course investors want to see an event at some point, whether that is being taken out or an I.P.O. The company behind us, Renovo Capital, is very patient. As long as things are working, they’re going to let us just roll with it. The goal right now is to grow top line revenue while maintaining bottom line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. You derive much of your income from subscriptions. Who are your main customers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Investors, real estate professionals and people in the home-buying process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Census Bureau and HUD buy large quantities of data. We have some banks that purchase data — I’m not at liberty to say who — and municipalities. The F.B.I. has purchased from us, and a lot of educational institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We also have a lot of free information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How do you gather your data?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We have on any given time north of 100 outsourced people that we call foot soldiers out there aggregating a lot of data. Some of the data you have to go to the courthouses to get, and then we have people who will go in with their cellphones and take pictures of it and go home and type it in. Some of it you can get online in PDFs and then you have to enter it in manually. Some ways I wish it was easier to get, but our competitive advantage is that it’s difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What’s your assessment of the housing market based on your latest foreclosure numbers ?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The housing market is out of intensive care and in stable condition, with some strong vital signs when it comes to higher home prices and lower foreclosure activity. U.S. foreclosure activity over all was down to a more than six-year low in April. But there still is a decent amount of foreclosure backlog in some local markets that needs to be cleared out of the system. A full housing recovery is going to take time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Has the process gotten easier for buying foreclosed property ?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. It has. The banks have gotten more efficient. They were bombarded with a whole lot of bad stuff at once and they weren’t equipped to deal with that, especially with the F.D.I.C. taking over other banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Do you own any foreclosed properties?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I have bought foreclosed properties in the past, mostly hospitality-based. I bought a hotel in Jackson Hole, Wyo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. But not foreclosed residential ?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I guess I’ve been too busy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Your main residence is in Park City, Utah[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/great-homes-and-destinations/destinations/mountain-states/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], but RealtyTrac’s headquarters are in Orange County, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I’ve been in Park City since the SkiWest days. I fly to Orange County on Monday morning, where I stay until Friday night, then go home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We made the office a fun place. We put in a gym so people stay. We’ll get a workout in and talk business the whole time; after that some of us will stick around, maybe work a little bit longer, have a tequila — all of which is good for creative discussions. You put a nice facility in, people are happy to stay at work longer.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joe Vollono and his wife, Monica Raquel Ortiz, are ready to buy an apartment. Actually, they were ready to buy in November, when they found a one-bedroom they loved in Brooklyn Heights and came to an agreement with the developer on the price. They were ready in January when they signed a contract, and they have been ready ever since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet more than seven months after the process began in earnest, they have not closed on their condominium. Why? Because Mr. Vollono, who served as an officer in the Navy submarine force for four years, wants to use a loan guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. That kind of loan is available under a 69-year-old program, with over half a million loans nationwide last year, but in New York City it is as though the program barely exists. There were only 266 Veterans Affairs loans made or refinanced in the five boroughs last year, in a city that is home to over 200,000 veterans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while there are many thousands of apartment buildings in the city, only 30 condominiums are approved for participation in the program. In Manhattan there are two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nobody here knows anything about it,'' Mr. Vollono said. ''Imagine you had the G.I. Bill, but no universities accepted it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage program is designed to help military veterans achieve the centerpiece of the American dream: the chance to own a house. But if you want to use what is known as a V.A. loan to buy an apartment in the biggest city in the country, you are practically out of luck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Veterans Affairs does not lend money but guarantees a portion of a veteran's loan, even with no down payment. But the department will offer guarantees on loans only up to a certain amount, about $725,000 in New York City. That figure, based on a <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> estimate of home values in the entire metropolitan area, including counties like Putnam and Rockland, is too low for much of the city marketplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the greater obstacles to using the program in New York are the rules. For a loan to buy a condominium, the entire building must apply to Veterans Affairs for approval, since the fate of one unit is tied to that of its neighbors. Buyers or owners of units cannot apply one by one. And cooperatives are barred from the program altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like we are a different country,'' said Stuart M. Saft, a partner at <span class="companylink">Holland &amp; Knight</span> and the chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums. Like other federal programs, he continued, V.A. loans ''are designed for other places.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In those other places, the program generally works well. According to Jason Hansman, a senior program manager at the group <span class="companylink">Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America</span>, it is one of the more straightforward Veterans Affairs programs to navigate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York City, however, Mr. Vollono and Ms. Ortiz said they had encountered a chorus of real estate agents on their apartment search who were unfamiliar with V.A. loans. When they went into contract at One Brooklyn Bridge Park, at 360 Furman Street in Brooklyn Heights, they found that the sales team there representing the building's sponsor appeared to have no experience with the loans either. It took almost six months for them and the sponsor's lawyer to submit a completed application to Veterans Affairs. The final piece was sent in just two weeks ago, Mr. Vollono said, and they are awaiting approval or denial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple declined to give the contract price on their apartment, but according to the real estate Web site Streeteasy, one-bedrooms in the building have tended to sell over the past six months for $700,000 to $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for One Brooklyn Bridge Park would not comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vollono has a job in finance, and master's degrees in public policy from <span class="companylink">Georgetown University</span> and in business administration from <span class="companylink">Oxford University</span>. Ms. Ortiz spent nearly a decade working at the State Department and now has a business importing French products. They have resources, experience with government, and even experience with the program, which Mr. Vollono used several years ago to buy a house in Newport, R.I. They are determined to make it work for them in Brooklyn, as well, so they can buy without a down payment and can keep the price they locked in months ago in a rising market. Yet the process drags on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The sad fact is that if you were the average young veteran,'' Mr. Vollono said, ''you'd give up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Frueh, the director of the loan guarantee program, suggested in a phone interview that the primary reason the loans were rare in New York City was the cost of housing. He also pointed to a 2006 expansion of the program that allowed Veterans Affairs to guarantee loans in co-ops, which would make them more usable in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he neglected to mention that the co-op inclusion expired at the end of 2011. During the period that the program had the authority to lend on co-ops, a spokeswoman said, it did not receive a single co-op application from anywhere in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat from the Upper East Side, introduced legislation last year that would permanently permit the participation of co-ops in the program. It would also require Veterans Affairs to promote that expansion, so that perhaps this time it might receive an application or two. Ms. Maloney said she planned to introduce the measure again during the current Congressional session.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's imperative that New York veterans have access to the same kind of home-buying support that veterans in other parts of the country obtain,'' Ms. Maloney said in an e-mail. ''Because a home is a home, whether it's a bungalow in the suburbs or a third-floor one-bedroom in Astoria.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not the only federal housing program that slams into roadblocks in the city. F.H.A. loans, which allow for very low down payments, for example, have a similarly ill-fitting design. Among other restrictions, the F.H.A., like Veterans Affairs, requires condo buildings to apply as a whole and excludes co-ops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As many buildings discovered after Hurricane Sandy, co-op associations are also ineligible for <span class="companylink">Federal Emergency Management Agency</span> grants for repairs to their common areas, like hallways left moldy or elevators damaged and corroded by flooding. Lifting that restriction would require an act of Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Vollono and Ms. Ortiz say getting a V.A. loan should require considerably less effort than that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had to remind the attorney and several other people on the attorney's staff,'' Ms. Ortiz recalled. ''I said, 'Don't forget where Sept. 11 happened.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm so sick of people saying 'We support our troops' -- show me you support our troops!''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bidding wars sound almost quaint. These days, the only way for would-be buyers to secure a home in many areas of the United States, it often seems, is to offer all cash and be ready to do so within hours, not days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bursting of the housing bubble in the past decade feels like ancient history in Los Angeles, where first-time home buyers are competing with investors to get into single-family homes with prices approaching $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘It’s everyone from a kid out of law school to an investor from China, walking around with thousands to spend,’’ said Kameron Eliassian, a Los Angeles real estate agent. ‘‘I don’t know where it’s coming from, and I don’t care. Just show me proof that it’s there, and we’re good.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After saving money for years, waiting for the residential real estate market to hit bottom, buyers all over the United States appear eager to get back in, lured by low interest rates and the prospect of a good deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with the number of homes for sale at historically low levels and large investors purchasing thousands of properties, buyers are facing a radically changed market and prices are quickly rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The percentage of homes bought with cash has shot up in many markets across the nation. Nearly a third of all homes purchased in Los Angeles during the first quarter of this year went for all cash, compared with 7 percent in 2007. In Miami, 65 percent of homes sold were for cash deals, compared with 16 percent six years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prices on all-cash deals are also rising significantly. In Los Angeles, the median price on an all-cash home this year is about $351,000, compared with $230,000 in 2009. Over the same period, the median price over all increased to $410,000, up $85,000. In fact, last month, home prices in Southern California hit their highest level in the past five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All-cash buyers, typically investors eager to renovate and flip — quickly resell — or rent out homes, are making it more difficult for first-time buyers, who typically rely on mortgage loans that can take weeks or months to materialize. More California homes have been flipped in the past year than in any year since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while Los Angeles may be a center of the frenzy, it is not an anomaly. Buyers in Boston are offering $100,000 more than the asking price or placing offers on homes they have spent only minutes in. In San Francisco; Miami; and Phoenix, Arizona, sellers are looking at dozens of offers within days of putting their home on the market, often accompanied by letters from would-be buyers professing their love for the property. New York City has seen similar drops in inventory, and prices have been rising steadily since 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly after Andres Alvarez, 36, got married last fall, he began to look for a home with his wife, figuring that their steady jobs, savings and good credit would make them the perfect buyers in Los Angeles. They were ready to spend $700,000. Their optimism deflated quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘We thought we were the cream of the crop, but anything that was in our price range and move-in ready, there was this insane competition,’’ Mr. Alvarez said. They put in nearly a dozen bids, often losing to cash buyers, before finding a two-bedroom home for $650,000. ‘‘It might be a great time to buy, but it’s a horrible time to be a buyer,’’ he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dick and Susan Yost can vouch for that. They wanted to downsize while leaving their home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to their son and his family. ‘‘We bid on eight places before we finally got one,’’ Mr. Yost said. ‘‘The worst we bid was $85,000 over the asking price, and we didn’t get it.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even unappealing homes, he said, had ‘‘people all over them.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there are plenty of skeptics wondering how long the sharp price increases can last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘People are realizing we’ve probably hit bottom, but the kinds of spikes we’re seeing in places like California seems like history is repeating itself,’’ said Daren Blomquist of RealtyTrac, which monitors residential sales. ‘‘That’s not sustainable for the long term, at least not for the regular home buyer, so I think there are some warning flags there.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For agents who spent the past several years scrounging for business, the change is welcome. When Mr. Eliassian listed a three-bedroom home in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood for $699,000 this year, he worried that the current renters would make it difficult to schedule prospective buyers. But with just two open houses — one meant only for other agents — nearly 300 people came through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘I had to turn the phone off to avoid people asking to see the place,’’ Mr. Eliassian said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the week, he had six offers, and the home sold for $745,000. He said he had represented and sold homes to more cash buyers in the past year than at any other time in his career.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lewis Legon, a developer in Salem, Massachusetts, jumped into the Boston market after he saw how many people were showing up at open houses. ‘‘It was like Times Square,’’ he said of one open house, at a property listed for $1.5 million. He beat out two dozen other bidders by offering $1.8 million in cash, not the first time he had made an all-cash offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘The first time, I was ready to have a heart attack,’’ he said of an all-cash purchase. ‘‘But it makes you a more attractive buyer and helps you stand out.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also waived the inspection clause, an increasingly common practice. While offers have typically included appraisal clauses, allowing buyers to back out if the home was valued below what they were willing to pay, offers today are more likely to include escalation clauses, saying buyers will pay an additional amount over the highest bid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Buyers are taking a lot more risks than they ever would before,’’ said Dana DeSimone, a Boston real estate agent who called the current market an ‘‘insane asylum.’’ ‘‘I don’t know that I’ve ever heard of waiving the inspection contingency on a 150-year-old brownstone until now.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now agents say their biggest challenge is potential sellers who are wary of putting their home on the market because they fear they cannot find a place to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff and Lorena Leininger considered moving from their suburban Los Angeles home over the past several years, but they feared they would not get as much as they paid for it. But this year, with their youngest child getting ready for kindergarten, they decided it was time. Three days after showing the home, they had nine offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘It felt as crazy as it was back when we bought 10 years ago,’’ Mr. Leininger said. ‘‘But it was much worse on the other side. We would show up to an open house, and it was already sold. The clear message was: Be ready to move fast or just get left out.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in Florida, where the market was once swamped with foreclosures, there are signs of the latest boom, with cash purchases fueled in part by international investors and retirees awash in cash after selling their homes elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don Faught, a manager with Alain Pinel Realtors near San Francisco, said the current market was turning buyers to desperation, particularly because the turnaround has come so quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘A year ago, people didn’t want a deal, they wanted a steal,’’ he said. ‘‘Sellers were listing homes for less than what they originally paid for them and offering all these concessions. Now, the only concessions are coming from the buyers.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His office has begun to track the number of offers clients make before landing a property. The current record: 27 offers, nearly all at or above asking price.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The empty shell of the enormous retail and entertainment complex in the New Jersey Meadowlands, formerly known as Xanadu, has served as a daily reminder of how outsize ambitions made it one of the most notorious examples of the real estate collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, a new developer says the former Xanadu project is about to become a testament to the rebounding market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Triple Five</span> Worldwide, the company chosen more than two years ago by Gov. Chris Christie to revive the project, says it plans to resume construction in the coming weeks, more than four years after work stopped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, a conglomerate based in Canada that owns two of the world's largest malls, plans to spend $1.7 billion, on top of the $1.9 billion spent by two previous developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our intent is to start shortly,'' said Tony Armlin, vice president for development construction at <span class="companylink">Triple Five</span>. ''We've never wavered in our intent to move forward. This is a great project.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current vision for the project is even bigger than the initial conception that failed so incredibly. It now has approvals to add an exotic glass-domed water park and an amusement park inspired by DreamWorks Animation -- in addition to the performing arts center, indoor ski hill, movie theater, 400 shops and more than 50 restaurants already planned for what they call American Dream Meadowlands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the hundreds of thousands of drivers who pass the derelict structure during every rush hour might be forgiven for their skepticism. After all, highly publicized starting dates have flown by like exit ramps on the Garden State Parkway with little to show for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most recently Governor Christie, who has promoted the project politically and financially, promised that it would be open by the time the area welcomes visitors to the 2014 Super Bowl, a date the company has acknowledged it will not meet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is partly because of opposition from the Jets and the Giants, who play at the nearby <span class="companylink">MetLife</span> Stadium in the Meadowlands. The football teams refiled a lawsuit last month seeking to block the expanded project, claiming that American Dream would turn game days into a traffic nightmare, a violation of their lease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It defies logic to say to have a complex that attracts 55 million, or 40 million, people a year, adding thousands and thousands of cars, and say it would not have a disastrous effect on ingress and egress,'' John K. Mara, president of the Giants, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also questions about the viability of the project. The company estimates that the complex will draw 40 million visitors a year, down from their previous 55 million estimate, and that half of them would be tourists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But New Jersey has no shortage of malls, six of which can be found within a 16-minute drive of <span class="companylink">MetLife</span> Stadium. And tourists may be reluctant to make the seven-mile trip from Times Square. (Last year, a record 52 million tourists visited New York City, but only 11.5 million traveled south of Midtown to Lower Manhattan.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, as <span class="companylink">Triple Five</span> gears up, retail brokers say they are beginning to see some momentum among retailers wary of the project's start-and-stop history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You could have written this thing off a couple of months ago,'' said Robert K. Futterman, whose firm, RKF Associates, represents Gap and Old Navy. ''But it now seems to be getting traction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">H &amp; M</span>, Uniqlo, Zara, Forever 21 and dozens of others stores, many of which are already well established in the region, have signed conditional letters of intent to move into the complex, despite Bergen County's blue laws, which prohibit retail sales on Sundays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Armlin said that the original project ''fell short on recreation and entertainment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is why <span class="companylink">Triple Five</span> has pushed to expand the project on an adjoining wetland parcel with an enclosed water park and, in partnership with DreamWorks, an amusement park based on Shrek, Kung Fu Panda and other animated movie characters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They had omitted one key feature: the amusements necessary to becoming a true tourist destination,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Triple Five</span>, which is owned by the Ghermezian family, envisions American Dream as a sister complex to the Mall of America in Minnesota and the West Edmonton Mall in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although <span class="companylink">Triple Five</span> has repeatedly tried and failed to add a third entertainment-retail mall to its portfolio, he said that this one would be successful because of the population density, relatively high household income and elaborate transportation networks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By late summer or early fall, Mr. Armlin said, <span class="companylink">Triple Five</span> plans to reach an agreement with the lenders that control the project, invest $200 million of its own money, take out a $700 million construction loan, raise as much as $450 million in secondary loans and sell up to $650 million in tax-exempt bonds. But, he insisted, construction will begin well before that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State and federal officials ultimately approved <span class="companylink">Triple Five</span>'s plan, with a healthy assist from the Christie administration, which has offered hundreds of millions of dollars in public financing for a project that was once hailed as cost free to taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many local officials also support American Dream, because of the promise of jobs and tax revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Giants and the Jets want the amusement and water parks closed on game days, arguing that the crowds will wreak havoc. Their lease has what is effectively a veto over any expansion of the original mall. ''Our endgame is not to kill the project,'' said Mr. Mara of the Giants. ''It's to protect our core business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Triple Five</span> contends that highway improvements and mass transit connections surrounding the stadium and the adjacent mall, racetrack and arena will make the impact negligible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For months now, Governor Christie has shuttled between the two sides with the hope of resolving the dispute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have worked hard to appease their concerns,'' Mr. Armlin said. ''The inability to reach a settlement clearly concerns us. There has to be something else going on.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot of people were surprised by the upsurge in home sales and prices last year, especially in some of the nation’s most depressed markets. Nationwide sales prices rose 7.3 percent last year, according to one major index, while prices in hard-hit Phoenix surged 23 percent. Other trouble spots, including Las Vegas and Riverside County, Calif., have also had double-digit gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it turns out, the surge was not mainly the result of first-time buyers or growing families or job relocators. Rather, as Nathaniel Popper reported[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/behind-the-rise-in-house-prices-wall-street-buyers/?hpw] in The Times, Wall Street investors — including the <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> and other private equity firms — have been big buyers in the troubled areas where prices have been rising the fastest. Those gains, in turn, have propelled rising home prices nationwide, in part by reducing supply and in part by fostering a shift in perceptions about the housing market that has drawn some potential home buyers off the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But is the housing rebound durable?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the Wall Street players, who have not traditionally invested in homes, are renting out the properties for now and planning to sell later at a profit. Their presence in the market is not so much confirmation that housing has revived as a bet that the economy will recover enough in the coming years to justify the investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They could be wrong. In many regions with the biggest housing rebounds, house prices have outstripped the growth of the local economies, suggesting that price gains are not sustainable. Or they could be right, and make a lot of money. But even if their bets pay off, certain distressing trends in the housing market are likely to persist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For starters, homeownership, now at an 18-year low of 65 percent[http://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/files/currenthvspress.pdf], is likely to stay low by historical standards for a long time. Investors are buying rental properties because the bust has turned many people into renters, including those who lost homes to foreclosure and those who would have bought homes but for job loss and high debt. Given the traditional role of homeownership in building wealth, fostering communities and driving the economy forward, a lower rate of homeownership is a troubling development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The emergence of Wall Street investors also reflects the continued failure of public policy to deal with the housing bust. The decline in homeownership and the loss of home equity could have been stanched if Congress and the Obama administration had aggressively pursued efforts to keep financially troubled borrowers in their homes, including bankruptcy reform and principal reduction loan modifications. But the banks did not want that, because it would have slowed their return to profitability. As a result, a glut of cheap homes and a ready supply of renters are available for Wall Street’s taking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even now, Wall Street’s involvement will complicate efforts by troubled borrowers to obtain loan modifications. After all, if there are Wall Street buyers for distressed homes, it is bound to be more advantageous for the bank that services the loan to steer homeowners into foreclosures or short sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing bust may be over. But the pain and damage lingers.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Bill Would Sweeten Loans for Energy-Efficient Homes</span>
</div><div class="author">By DIANE CARDWELL </div><div>783 words</div><div>7 June 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers purchasing energy-efficient properties could qualify for larger mortgages than their incomes would normally allow under a Senate bill reintroduced Thursday with broad real estate industry support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measure would allow lenders to include projected energy savings from efficiency upgrades when measuring the borrower's income against expenses and the value of the home against the debt. In addition to giving borrowers larger loans in new purchases and refinancings, it could also lower their interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Johnny Isakson, a Republican from Georgia who worked in the real estate industry for 33 years and introduced the bill with Senator Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado, said that consumers should get credit for energy-saving construction materials, which are often ''out of sight and out of mind and are not valued.'' Decreasing the amount of energy a home uses, he said in an interview, increases ''the amount of dollars in the pockets of the homeowners.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government already promotes so-called energy-efficient mortgages under a Department of Housing and Urban Development program. But the proposed legislation would require lenders to take the projected energy savings into account when presented with a qualified energy report. The senators originally introduced the bill in 2011, and although it attracted support from groups across a broad political spectrum -- including the United States Chamber of Commerce and the <span class="companylink">Center for American Progress</span> -- it failed to gain approval. The sponsors have broadened its appeal within the real estate industry, chiefly by eliminating provisions that could have penalized older, less efficient homes or those lacking a report based on estimated energy consumption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How the bill will fare this time around is unclear. Its proponents in the Senate say they are hopeful it could pass, possibly as part of a comprehensive energy bill introduced by Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, and Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio. The proponents say the changes could curtail energy use, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the market for conservation upgrades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The legislation would apply to loans guaranteed by the federal agencies that collectively back roughly 90 percent of new mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the absence of a home energy report, which would come from an approved third-party inspector, the home's energy use would not become a factor. But lenders would provide applicants with information about the benefits of investing in energy-saving upgrades and counsel them on how they could go about doing so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Really we're just talking about disclosure here,'' Sean Babington, legislative counsel on energy and natural resources for Senator Bennet, said in an interview. ''For years you've had to disclose if there are termites in your house or if you have radon gas in your basement. You bring an inspector out to make sure the foundation's not cracked. Here we have something that probably over the life of the home costs the homeowner orders of magnitude more than all those problems, and we totally ignore it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Senator Bennet's office, a household's average energy costs can run to more than $70,000 over the life of a 30-year loan, more than the real estate taxes and insurance payments that are already taken into account during the underwriting process. Investments in insulated hollow-core doors, double-pane windows and insulated floor-joist systems above crawl spaces can reduce the average home's bill by at least 30 percent, a value that does not always translate into a higher purchase price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm, said the consensus in the real estate market was that ''people want green, but to date they haven't been willing to pay for it to the extent of what it costs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If passed, proponents say, the proposal could help close that gap, in addition to promoting energy conservation and construction jobs, generating $1.1 billion a year in savings for consumers by 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loan applicants could expect to gain about 5 percent more borrowing power on average, said Cliff Majersik, executive director of the Institute for Market Transformation, a nonprofit group that promotes energy efficiency in buildings and helped shape the proposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Many people buy what they can qualify for and no more and no less,'' he said. ''There are $2 trillion in mortgage loans that happen every year, and the fact that you have this big blind spot is an enormous impediment to energy efficiency.''</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Wall St. Buyers Behind the Rise In House Prices</span>
</div><div class="author">By NATHANIEL POPPER </div><div>1361 words</div><div>4 June 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time the housing market was this hot in Phoenix and Las Vegas, the buyers pushing up prices were mostly small time. Nowadays, they are big time -- Wall Street big.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large investment firms have spent billions of dollars over the last year buying homes in some of the nation's most depressed markets. The influx has been so great, and the resulting price gains so big, that ordinary buyers are feeling squeezed out. Some are already wondering if prices will slump anew if the big money stops flowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The growth is being propelled by institutional money,'' said Suzanne Mistretta, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>. ''The question is how much the change in prices really reflects market demand, rather than one-off market shifts that may not be around in a couple years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street played a central role in the last housing boom by supplying easy -- and, in retrospect, risky -- mortgage financing. Now, investment companies like the <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> have swooped in, buying thousands of houses in the same areas where the financial crisis hit hardest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>, which helped define a period of Wall Street hyperwealth, has bought some 26,000 homes in nine states. Colony Capital, a Los Angeles-based investment firm, is spending $250 million each month and already owns 10,000 properties. With little fanfare, these and other financial companies have become significant landlords on Main Street. Most of the firms are renting out the homes, with the possibility of unloading them at a profit when prices rise far enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While these investors have not touched many healthy real estate markets, they are among the biggest buyers in struggling areas of the country where housing prices have been increasing the fastest. Those gains, in turn, have been at the leading edge of rising home prices nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some see the emergence of Wall Street buyers as a market-driven answer to the nation's housing ills. Investment companies are buying up rundown homes at a time when ordinary people can't or won't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, 68 percent of the damaged homes sold in April went to investors, and only 19 percent to first-time home buyers, according to Campbell HousingPulse. That is helping to shore up prices and create confidence in the broader markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When people write the story of this housing recovery, these investors will be seen to have helped put the floor under the housing market,'' said David Bragg, an analyst at Green Street Advisors. ''In some of the key markets, that contributed to the recovery.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story, though, often looks more complicated on the ground. Joe Cusumano, a real estate agent in Riverside County, Calif., said that in recent months 90 percent of his business had been for companies like Invitation Homes, a <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> subsidiary. Home values in Riverside County have risen by 15 percent in the last year, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Cusumano said he wondered if faraway investors would properly maintain the homes they buy. He said that Invitation Homes had been willing to put money into the properties, but he was not so sure about the other players. He also worries what will happen when these investors start selling, as they inevitably will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The thing that scares me is the values going up so quickly,'' said Mr. Cusumano. ''That's what happened before and that's what's scaring me. Is this going to happen again?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea of investors' buying homes and renting them out is nothing new. But in the past, landlords were almost always local. Now big investors are using agents like Mr. Cusumano to stake a claim to entire neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign of the potential peril ahead, some of the investment firms have recently taken the first steps to cash out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investment fund financed by Colony Capital filed last week to go public, the second firm to do so in May. Another early player in the business, the Carrington Holding Company, said last week that prices had risen too far, leading the firm to begin selling some of its holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> warned last Tuesday that prices for single-family homes in the regions with the biggest housing rebounds had been outpacing the growth rate in the local economies and ''could stall or possibly reverse'' if big investors start selling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We see economies that continue to struggle -- we don't see them recovering enough to justify this drastic increase in prices,'' said Ms. Mistretta at Fitch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the recent gains, housing prices remain well below their precrisis highs. In Riverside, for example, home values are still down more than 40 percent from their 2006 records, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the extent that the housing rebound is becoming overheated in some pockets, it does not carry the most significant risks of the real estate boom that came crashing down in 2008. The new investment groups are not heavily indebted, making them less vulnerable to small movements in real estate values, and the risks are not spread as widely through the financial system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly all of the big investors have insisted that they plan to rent the houses they are buying for years to come. The <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> unit, Invitation Homes, has opened 14 offices across the country to serve the homes it has bought, a spokesman for the firm said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At American Residential Properties, which went public in May, the chief executive, Stephen G. Schmitz, said that if other firms start selling their houses, ''we'll step up our buying.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: ''We still think that we're in a buyer's market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet some investment companies are already pulling back in the markets that have had the fastest growth. In Phoenix, the percentage of all house purchases involving investors fell to about 25 percent in March from a high of 36 percent last summer, according to the Campbell HousingPulse Survey. The same survey shows that investors have been increasing their presence in new areas like Florida and California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this has made it hard for house hunters like Jeff Martin, who is looking to buy a fixer-upper in Riverside County. Mr. Martin, 58, has made offers on 15 houses over the last year. Last Wednesday, he received his latest rejection. On most of the houses, Mr. Martin has lost out to investors offering all cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Martin, a retired Navy veteran, puts much of the blame on banks that have been holding onto empty houses, lowering the supply of available homes. He said he has trouble faulting the investors, given that he was involved in real estate financing during the last boom. But he is worried that if mortgage rates begin to rise he will lose out on his opportunity to buy. Rising mortgage rates could also lead to a broader slowdown in the real estate recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cusumano said that the investors he works for have been trimming back their purchases in the area. His agency closed on three houses for investors in May, down from eight in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the fevered pitch of the market has not died down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late May, one of his clients closed on a house just a month after it went on the market. There were eight bidders, despite a listing that said ''NEEDS TLC!!'' Mr. Cusumano's client won the house only after agreeing to go $500 over the asking price of $194,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just a strange market,'' he said. ''We are in uncharted territory.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there was any doubt that New York City[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/manhattan/?inline=nyt-geo] real estate has become a seller’s market, consider the following: open houses are packed to capacity, bidding wars and all-cash offers have almost become the norm, and some listing prices actually rise, not drop, after a home is listed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s the kind of insanity you live for in this business,” said Mickey Conlon, a broker with CORE, recalling a two-bedroom two-bath condominium at 49 East 21st Street in the Flatiron neighborhood that he listed with his business partner, Tom Postilio, for $1.89 million in early January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“At the moment, that was considered aggressive pricing,” Mr. Conlon said. Yet within 24 hours, the brokers had received a flurry of requests to see the place, which prompted them to be bold. The next day they raised the price by $100,000, to $1.99 million. Though some potential buyers grumbled about the change, about 100 people came to the first open house. Soon, there were multiple offers above the asking price. By the end of January, there was a signed contract for $2.16 million — all cash. The sale closed in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rules of engagement for buying an apartment in the city have changed. Negotiation, brokers say, is no longer part of the equation. Forget about taking time to mull over your decision. Serious buyers need to be prepared to pounce. And while lots of cash has always helped, it’s now more important than ever, as sellers select the best offers with the least amount of hassle involved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that sellers can name just any price. Brokers caution that even in this market of extremely tight inventory, listings priced too high tend to linger, and low prices intended to bring the biggest crowds through the door could result in lowball offers. There is an art to choosing the right price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While housing prices across the country recently posted their biggest gains in seven years, New York City’s market has been experiencing a slow and steady recovery ever since the market hit bottom in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, scarce apartment listings and low mortgage rates have stoked competition among buyers and driven up prices. The number of Manhattan[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/manhattan/?inline=nyt-geo] apartments for sale dropped 27.6 percent last month, to 5,077, versus 7,011 for the same period a year ago, according to the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. At the same time, prices have inched up. The median sale price rose 12 percent to $930,000, from $829,000 a year ago, according to the most recent available data for the second quarter, which began on April 1. That follows a 5.9 percent year-over-year increase in the median sale price, to $820,555, in the first three months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartments are going into contract at a faster pace, with listings lasting 105 days on the market, down from 156 a year ago, according to Miller Samuel. In popular neighborhoods like the West Village, it’s not uncommon for sought-after properties to go into contract well above the asking price in the head-spinning span of 10 days or less. Brokers are fueling the frenzy, turning open houses into pressure cookers, with tactics like one-day-only showings and short deadlines set for best and final offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet for the tenacious buyer, it is still possible to land an apartment without offering a pound of flesh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After losing one place in a bidding war and another because he waited a week to make up his mind, Shamoun Afram, a program manager at an investment bank in Manhattan, kicked his search for a one-bedroom condo into high gear and homed in on the Orion, a modern high-rise condominium in Midtown. In January he toured about 10 units there with the help of his real estate agent, Patrick Mills of CORE, and he was about to sign a contract on an apartment slightly above his $1 million sweet spot when he noticed a new listing on Streeteasy.com late on a Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next morning he was on the phone with his broker to see if he could get in to see the apartment that day, but it wasn’t being shown until Thursday. “I knew I had to make a decision fast,” Mr. Afram said. He put in an offer that day, sight unseen, at the full asking price of $999,000. “We decided, let’s just be cavalier about it,” Mr. Mills added. The offer was accepted on Wednesday; on Thursday they toured the apartment; and on Friday they signed the contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that didn’t stem a wave of interest in the apartment. “After we had the contract out, people started to call,” said Sarah Son, a broker at <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> who represented the seller. “Even after we told them we had a signed contract,” she said, “they kept trying to make us an offer. It was really crazy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a highly competitive market, where cash is king, here is what you need to do to buy an apartment in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REFRESH, REFRESH, REFRESH. With prime listings being snapped up, the faster you get to an apartment the better. Web sites including nytimes.com/realestate[http://nytimes.com/realestate], Streeteasy.com and <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span> eliminate some of the work by automating your search. Apartment hunters can save search criteria, and the sites will e-mail new listings that meet their requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DON’T WAIT FOR THE OPEN HOUSE. “If you can’t see an apartment the first week it is on the market,” said Doug Perlson, the chief executive of the online brokerage RealDirect, “there is a good chance you will not even get a chance to make an offer. Schedule a showing during the week before the first open house and use the open house for your second visit. Then you should be ready to make your offer.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FORGET ABOUT GETTING A DEAL. The conventional wisdom over the last few years has been to come in at 5 percent below the asking price when making an initial offer. That won’t fly for attractive listings that are particularly scarce, especially if they are priced fairly. “Give the full price with no contingencies and leave that offer on the table for 24 hours,” said Shaun Osher, the chief executive of CORE. “You want to let the seller know that you’re really serious, that you really want the property, but you’re not going to let them use you as bait to get a higher offer.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DON’T DELAY. Being the first to make a solid offer can give you an edge. When a one-bedroom two-bath unit at the Memphis Downtown Condominium in the West Village drew more than 100 people to its first open house, Adolfo Brenes and Lena Datwani of Bellmarc Realty knew they had to act quickly on behalf of the buyer they were representing. They submitted an all-cash offer at the full asking price of $1.65 million. The next day they received a call from the seller’s broker informing them that two other full-price all-cash offers had been made. “Because we were first,” Mr. Brenes said, “the seller was giving us the chance to come up to $1.8 million to take it off the market.” Having been outbid for other West Village apartments at the full asking price, the buyer decided to meet the seller’s increased price. They closed the deal in April. A few weeks later, a similar apartment four floors above was listed at $2.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BE THOROUGH. A well-prepared offering package can be a leg up for buyers. When submitting an offer on behalf of her clients for a two-bedroom in Carnegie Hill recently, Lisa Larson, a Warburg Realty associate broker, “prepared the buyers’ financial statement, as well as a short bio, as this was a co-op and we also needed to show that they would pass the board’s approval process. We also presented the offer as all-cash and agreed to sign the contract in five days.” Her clients, she said, were recently approved by the board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RAISE YOUR DOWN PAYMENT. Thirty or 35 percent down is the new 20 percent, brokers say. In a rising market, appraisals tend to lag behind asking prices because they are based on past sales of comparable apartments. Banks will not lend more than the appraised amount, so buyers need to come up with more cash to make up the difference. “The stronger offers are the ones putting down more money,” said Josh Scheier, a public defender with the Legal Aid Society in Brooklyn[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/brooklyn/?inline=nyt-geo] who was recently in the enviable position of choosing among 30 offers for the two-bedroom two-bath co-op in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, that he and his wife, Anat Soudry, listed in April for $699,000. After winnowing the possibilities down to two of the highest offers — both of which were more than 20 percent above the asking price — Mr. Scheier said the decision came down to who was “less of a risk” if the apartment were to appraise for less. The winner offered to put 50 percent down and had more money left over after the purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEWARE MORTGAGE CONTINGENCIES. With demand high, fewer sellers are willing to accept contingencies, and desperate buyers may feel pressed to waive the mortgage contingency and risk losing the typical 10 percent deposit, in order to have a shot at an apartment. But unless you have the cash to cover your losses, it’s not a good idea. Without a contingency, you will lose your deposit if the appraisal comes in low and you are unable to make up the difference, or if the bank finds something wrong with the building and will not lend the money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEGOTIATE THE CONTINGENCY. Christopher Kromer of Halstead Property and his business partner, Nora Ariffin, recently found something of a middle ground. The buyer they represented wasn’t comfortable making his offer of $1.7 million for a two-bedroom in TriBeCa without a mortgage contingency, and the seller was concerned that a low appraisal could ruin the deal. “What I suggested is that we present our offer with a 70 percent contingency, while reserving the right to finance 80 percent,” Mr. Kromer said.&nbsp; “This is essentially telling the seller that the buyer will put down 30 percent if the bank requires it, but he is also reserving the right to put down 20 percent if allowed.”&nbsp; This addressed the seller’s concerns while creating a 10 percent cushion for the buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SET YOUR ULTIMATE PRICE. If a bidding war ensues, buyers will need to have a “walkaway number,” Mr. Kromer said. Mr. Conlon of CORE put it this way: “Think of it like anything else you are going to buy or like something on <span class="companylink">eBay</span>. What is the number you are willing to go up to and be able to sleep at night?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SIGN YOUR CONTRACT QUICKLY. A year ago, buyers could take as much as two to three weeks for due diligence and negotiation before signing a contract. “Today’s sellers are less patient and may pull a deal from a buyer that is taking too long,” said Mr. Perlson of RealDirect.&nbsp;“Also, since there is nothing binding until a contract is signed, we have seen very aggressive buyers try to steal a deal by offering an amount significantly above ask to try to get the seller to switch buyers.” Ethical brokers, he added, will not abandon an accepted offer, but if it takes too long, they will go to their backup faster than in the past.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lloyds Banking Group</span> is on a selling spree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, the British bank announced that it had agreed to sell a portfolio of U.S. securities backed by real estate for £3.3 billion to a number of U.S. investors, including <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>. Lloyds said it expected to generate a pretax profit of £540 million from the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disposal is part of the bank’s mounting efforts to increase its capital reserves after British regulators demanded that the country’s banking sector raise a combined £25 billion, or $38 billion, by the end of the year to fill a capital shortfall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale of the mortgage-backed securities allowed Lloyds to benefit from a resurgent U.S. property market, where housing prices rose almost 11 percent in March from a year earlier, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span>/Case-Shiller home price index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lloyds said it sold the portfolio at a 22 percent premium to the combined £2.7 billion value of the securities. The deal is expected to close in the coming week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transaction is the latest in a series of asset sales by Lloyds, which is 39 percent owned by the <span class="companylink">British government</span> after it received a bailout during the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this past week, Lloyds announced the sale of its private banking unit in Miami to the Spanish firm <span class="companylink">Banco Sabadell</span>, and the sale of its international private banking subsidiary to <span class="companylink">Union Bancaire Privée</span> for around £100 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transactions follow a recent sale of the shares in the wealth management firm St. James’s Place, which raised £450 million. It was the second time Lloyds has reduced its stake in the company in an effort to bolster its capital reserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In total, the disposals have pushed the bank’s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of a firm’s ability to weather financial shocks, to about 8.7 percent from 8.1 percent in the first quarter of the year, under the accountancy rules known as Basel III. Lloyds has said that it plans to reach a 9 percent ratio by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the deal, Lloyds TSB Group Pension Trust will generate pretax profit of £360 million from selling its share of the securities, which have a book value of £805 million. The proceeds will be used to reduce the pension fund’s deficit, according to a company statement.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — The economy grew at a modest 2.4 percent annual rate from January through March, slightly slower than initially estimated. Consumer spending was stronger than first thought, but businesses restocked more slowly, and state and local government spending cuts were deeper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said on Thursday that economic growth in the first quarter was only marginally below the 2.5 percent annual rate the government had estimated last month. The rate is still much faster than the 0.4 percent growth during the October-December quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most economists think growth is slowing to around a 2 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter as the economy adjusts to federal spending cuts, higher taxes and further global weakness. Still, many say the decline may not be as severe as once thought. The numbers have been buoyed by solid hiring, surging home prices and record stock gains, which should keep consumers spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said the small revision to first-quarter growth supported her view that the economy would grow a moderate 2.2 percent for the year, the same as last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Ms. Lee said she expected growth to improve to 3.2 percent in 2014, as the job market accelerates and consumers grow more confident in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employers have added an average of 208,000 jobs a month since November, well above the monthly average of 138,000 during the previous six months. And the government said on Thursday that weekly jobless aid applications had risen to 354,000, a level consistent with modest job gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the number of Americans who signed contracts to buy homes edged up in April to the highest level in three years. The increase points to growth in home sales in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Thursday that its seasonally adjusted index for pending home sales rose 0.3 percent to 106. That is the highest since April 2010, when a home buyer tax credit inflated sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signed contracts have jumped 10.3 percent in the last 12 months. 8There is generally a one- to two-month lag between a signed contract and a completed sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously occupied homes rose in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.97 million, a 3 1/2 year high. Sales of new homes also rose in April, to nearly a five-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the supply of homes on the market remained low, and that could keep sales from accelerating later this year. The number of available homes for sale rose in April, the Realtors’ group said last week, but was still down 14 percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer homes for sale may be holding back sales in tight markets in the West, like Las Vegas and Phoenix. In those cities, many homeowners still owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Federal Program for Distressed Homeowners Is Extended</span>
</div><div class="author">By JACKIE CALMES </div><div>641 words</div><div>31 May 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Despite signs of revival in housing, the Obama administration announced on Thursday an extension of its principal program for helping distressed homeowners to get mortgage modifications and avoid foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, and Shaun Donovan, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, said the Making Home Affordable program, which includes the Home Affordable Modification Program, known as HAMP, and related consumer protections, would remain in effect through 2015. They were due to lapse at the end of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under HAMP, the federal government gives financial incentives to mortgage providers to modify the loans of eligible borrowers so the homeowners' monthly payments do not exceed 31 percent of their monthly income. Beneficiaries have included homeowners with negative equity where property values plummeted and those who lost jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The housing market is gaining steam, but many homeowners are still struggling,'' Mr. Lew said in a joint statement with Mr. Donovan. ''Extending the program for two years,'' he added, ''will benefit many additional families while maintaining clear standards and accountability for an important part of the mortgage industry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Donovan said of the program: ''Families across the country have used its tools to reduce their principal, modify their mortgages, fight foreclosure and stay in their homes -- helping further stimulate our housing market recovery. And with this extension, we ensure that the program keeps supporting communities for years to come.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama introduced the mortgage-modification program and related initiatives in early 2009 at the peak of the recession and credit crisis. But, especially at the outset, the initiatives collectively called the Making Home Affordable program did not come near to fulfilling the administration's promise of relief for several million homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks and other financial institutions were slow to participate, while many homeowners were either dissuaded or disqualified by paperwork requirements and restrictions intended to prevent waste and fraud in the $30 billion program. Over time, administration officials refined the initiative and pressured lenders to help borrowers. Participation increased, if not to the anticipated levels of three million to four million homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, in 2012, after widespread reports of foreclosure abuses, five of the nation's biggest banks agreed to a $25 billion settlement with the federal government and 49 state attorneys general that required them to modify homeowners' payment terms. The lenders were <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>, Citi, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and Ally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Treasury Department, about 1.3 million homeowners received direct assistance from the Making Home Affordable initiatives. Another 300,000 have received other relief, like forbearance in mortgage payments for homeowners who suddenly lost their jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of March 2013, Treasury said, more than 1.1 million homeowners had moved from trial modifications to permanent modifications of their mortgages, for median savings of $546 a month, an amount that exceeds the median relief resulting from private sector modifications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the special inspector general charged with overseeing such relief programs, in the most recent quarterly report on April 24, expressed concern at the number of loan defaults among homeowners who have received assistance through mortgage modifications that reduced their payments.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">DELL</span> FIGHTS BACK &nbsp;|&nbsp; The fight over <span class="companylink">Dell Inc</span>. has climbed to a new level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The computer maker on Friday began its official campaign to support a proposed $24.4 billion sale of itself to Michael S. Dell and the investment firm Silver Lake, amid continued opposition to the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The computer company filed its definitive proxy materials after receiving final approval from the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span>. And it set July 18 as the date for a shareholder vote on the transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Dell</span> said that its board had examined every possible alternative to the deal, and rebutted calls by <span class="companylink">Southeastern Asset Management</span> and Carl C. Icahn to instead pursue a big stock buyback and special dividend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our analysis led us to conclude unanimously that a sale to the Michael Dell/Silver Lake group for $13.65 per share is the best alternative available — in a challenging business environment it offers certainty and a very material premium over pre-announcement trading prices,” the company wrote in a letter to shareholders.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LLOYDS’ BIG MORTGAGE SALE &nbsp;|&nbsp; Lloyds Banking announced that it had agreed to sell a portfolio of United States real estate-backed securities for £3.3 billion ($5 billion) to a number of American investors, including <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>. The British firm said it expected to generate a pretax income of £540 million from the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disposal is part of Lloyds’ mounting efforts to increase its capital reserves after British regulators demanded that the country’s banking sector raise a combined £25 billion to fill a capital shortfall by the end of the year, Mark Scott reports on DealBook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By offloading the American mortgage-backed securities, the British bank has benefited from a resurgent American property market, where housing prices in March rose almost 11 percent compared to the same period last year, according to the S.&amp;P. Case-Shiller home price index.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Graduates say the classes give them a new appreciation for the heart of financial analysis. An eight-hour crash course on leveraged buyouts from Training the Street was so intensive that it “kind of makes you want to slit your wrists,” said Michael Rojas, who graduated from Columbia Business School this month.</p>

</div><div class="author">By JULIE CRESWELL </div><div>803 words</div><div>30 May 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After more than a year of intense behind-the-scenes battles, stakeholders that own the Empire State Building approved a plan this week to sell the 102-story tower as part of an initial public offering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan's approval is a major victory for Peter L. Malkin and his son Anthony E. Malkin, the real estate barons who control the landmark tower but are minority owners. They have vigorously campaigned in recent months to persuade 80 percent of the building's roughly 3,000 stakeholders to vote in favor of going public, even as a small group of stakeholders fought against the plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The threshold was finally crossed Tuesday, according to a filing made with the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> on Wednesday. That vote now clears the way for the Malkins to offer to the public shares in <span class="companylink">Empire State Realty Trust</span> -- a company that will combine 19 properties in the New York area with the crown jewel, the Empire State Building. The public offering is expected to raise as much as $1 billion, and the Malkins' stake could be valued as much as $730 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vote was delayed for months by a small group of dissidents led by a California businessman, Richard Edelman, and Andrew S. Penson, a speculative investor. They had contended that the deal could hurt the value of investors' shares, potentially exposing them to tax liabilities and the wild swings in the stock market, all while enriching the Malkins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tide began to turn this month when a New York State judge ruled in favor of the Malkins in a legal challenge mounted by some members of the dissidents' group. The group was fighting a provision that requires holdouts to either sell their units back for $100 a unit, or vote in favor of the plan after the 80 percent threshold is reached. The plans for the public offering values those units at about $323,000 each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for <span class="companylink">Malkin Holdings</span> said in an e-mailed statement that the company was pleased with the vote tally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The vote remains open and we urge all investors who have not yet voted in favor of the proposed consolidation and I.P.O. to do so immediately,'' the statement said. ''We look forward to delivering to our investors what we believe to be the many benefits of this transaction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some of the dissidents vowed to continue to fight the plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are going away for a month or two months, and they don't want to worry about getting a 10-day notice that says they have to change their vote or they could lose their investment for $100,'' Mr. Edelman said. ''That's a pretty coercive way to get people to vote in your favor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Edelman said that a motion to stay the judge's decision as well as an appeal have been filed in the New York case and that those outcomes would affect whether the public offering goes forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen B. Meister, the lawyer representing some of the dissidents in the court case, said he expected a decision soon on the motion to stay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know that it will be feasible to contemplate the transaction even in the absence of a stay because anyone involved in the transaction would know that if I win, the votes would be no good,'' Mr. Meister said. ''I have no idea how you do a $1 billion I.P.O. with that hanging over you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While even supporters of the deal said the Malkins would become wealthy as a result of the offering, many said they wanted the ability afforded by a publicly traded company to sell their stakes easily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fight is part of a longstanding feud dating back to 1961, when Harry B. Helmsley, a prominent figure in New York real estate, and his partner, Lawrence A. Wien, bought control of the Empire State Building from the industrialist Henry Crown. Peter Malkin, who was also involved in that deal, is the son-in-law of Mr. Wien; Anthony Malkin is Mr. Wien's grandson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help finance the deal, the group sold 3,300 units in the building priced at $10,000 a unit. Mr. Edelman said the group of dissidents would hold their regularly scheduled conference call on Thursday night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm sure it will be a lively one,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans are in a buying mood, thanks largely to the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest sign emerged Tuesday as the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span> Case-Shiller home price index posted the biggest gains in seven years. Housing prices rose in every one of the 20 cities tracked, continuing a trend that began three months ago. Similar strength has appeared in new and existing home sales and in building permits, as rising home prices are encouraging construction firms to accelerate building and hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broad-based housing improvements appear to be buoying consumer confidence and spending, countering fears earlier this year that many consumers would pull back in response to government austerity measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, the two-year-old payroll tax holiday ended, stripping about $700 from the average household’s annual income, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Federal government spending cuts that started in March are also serving as a drag on economic growth, economists say. And some recent data on other parts of the economy, like manufacturing and exports, have also disappointed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet consumer confidence reached a five-year high in May, according to a Conference Board report also released on Tuesday, with big improvements in Americans’ views about both the current economy and future economic conditions. Consumer spending has also been strikingly resilient so far this year, given the tax hikes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Five years after the start of the financial crisis in earnest, and four years and a week’s time from the beginning of the economic recovery, we’re finally starting to get more of a pickup,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics. “It’s been a very drawn-out process, but you have to remember what we’ve been digging our way out of.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent decline in gas prices is probably helping, as are increases in the stock market even though only about half of Americans own any equities. [http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/08/stock-markets-rise-but-half-of-americans-dont-benefit/] Perhaps most important, economists say, the growth in the value of the existing housing stock means that homeowners around the country are finally feeling richer, and that so-called wealth effect is probably making consumers loosen their purse strings a bit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The positive impact of rising home values and the appreciating stock market is expected to offset at least a third of the fiscal tightening, according to Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller 20-city composite index rose 10.9 percent over the last year, the biggest increase since April 2006. Several cities — Charlotte, N.C.; Los Angeles; Portland, Ore.; Seattle; and Tampa, Fla. — had their largest month-over-month gains in more than seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stock markets rose on the news, with the S.&amp; P. 500-stock index up 10.46, or 0.63 percent, at 1,660.06 and the Dow up 106.29, or 0.69 percent, at 15,409.39 at the close on Tuesday. The Nasdaq was up 29.74, or 0.86 percent, at 3,488.89. The 10-year Treasury yield surged to 2.17 percent, its highest level in over a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The double-digit housing price increase is being driven by a confluence of factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one, employers have added jobs for 31 straight months, so families are willing to start buying again. At the same time, the inventory of homes available on the market remains unusually low, thanks to little new building in the last few years and the large number of homeowners who are still underwater on their mortgages, making them reluctant to sell at a cash loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now there are signs that higher prices are beginning to encourage some would-be sellers to come off the sidelines and place their homes on the market. That could be healthy for the market, countering concerns that housing might become overvalued again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You’ve had this dynamic that has been favorable for price increases now, but it’s also favorable for supply to come back on market, so that will mean some moderation in the pace of price increases,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>, who said that he expected home prices to continue growing but not necessarily at the double-digit rate seen in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction has been picking up, too, in response to the rise in home prices, but builders cannot bring homes to the market as quickly as buyers want them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You really need new construction to get rid of the shortages, but it takes seven months between the time when they take out a permit and when the builder actually completes the home,” said Patrick Newport, an economist with IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also pushing up home price measures are the declines in distressed sales — that is, foreclosures and short sales. Homes in foreclosure typically sell at bargain-basement prices, which depresses the overall price levels reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the composition of homes sold includes fewer sales at the depressed prices that bring down the overall numbers, said Michael Gapen, senior United States economist at <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>. The decline in distressed sales and so-called shadow inventory (homes that are behind on mortgage payments or in foreclosure, but not yet on the market) had been pushing up prices, Mr. Gapen said, but that upward pressure will fade over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, home prices in many areas experienced severe, unsustainable plunges during the recession. The recent increases are coming off a very low base, so the growth looks strong even if the level of prices is still well below the peaks of the housing boom in the middle of the decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Some of the areas with the largest declines in house prices during the crisis have shown the strongest increases in prices more recently,” Mr. Silver said. In Phoenix, for example, home values have risen 22.5 percent from a year earlier; Las Vegas posted a 20.6 percent gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists generally expect home prices to continue rising, particularly as the economy improves and more young people move out of their parents’ homes and into homes of their own. And many dismiss concerns of a potential bubble, not only because household formation is growing but also because housing prices remain well below their highs. Even after 10 straight months of year-over-year gains, the 20-city Case-Shiller composite price index is 28 percent below its previous peak in July 2006, which is probably a good thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Talk of a house price bubble seems premature,” said Ed Stansfield, an economist at Capital Economics. “In relation to incomes, rents or their own past, U.S. home prices still look low.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What’s more, credit is still hard to come by. The Federal Reserve has pushed interest rates down about as far as they can go, but many people who want to buy are still finding it difficult to get a home loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We usually think of bubbles as being driven by extremely easy credit, with people borrowing more than the outstanding value of the house and making little to no down payment,” said Mr. Gapen. “That’s not the case with credit standards today.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices surged as resales of homes in the United States rose in April to the highest level in nearly three and a half years, offering the economy a buffer from the stiff headwinds of belt-tightening in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Wednesday that existing-home sales had advanced 0.6 percent to an annual rate of 4.97 million units, the highest level since November 2009. The data underscored the housing market’s improving fortunes as it starts to regain its footing. Resales were 9.7 percent higher than in the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s quite supportive of the overall economy,” said Michelle Meyer, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span><span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> in New York. “It’s a cushion against some of the other concerns in the economy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight supplies in some parts of the country have constrained the pace of home sales, but sellers are starting to wade back into the market, attracted by rising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, the median home sales price increased 11 percent from a year ago to $192,800, the highest level since August 2008. It was the fifth consecutive month of double-digit gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With prices rising, more sellers put their properties on the market. The inventory of homes on the market rose 11.9 percent from March to 2.16 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to signs that the housing recovery was becoming firmly established, distressed properties, which can weigh on prices because they typically sell at deep discounts, accounted for only 18 percent of sales last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the lowest since the real estate association started monitoring them in October 2008. Those properties — foreclosures and short sales — made up 21 percent of sales in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another bright sign, properties were selling more quickly. The median time on the market for homes was 46 days in April, down from 62 days the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 44 percent of all homes sold in April had been on the market for less than a month, while only 8 percent had been on the market for a year or longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were up in three of the four regions, falling 3.4 percent in the Midwest.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New data released Thursday on the United States economy showed some worrisome signs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jobless claims rose sharply last week, while housing starts tumbled in April and a gauge of underlying inflation pointed to weak demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data could feed fears over the impact of a government austerity drive that began in January and could also raise pressure on the Federal Reserve to continue to buy bonds to support the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits climbed last week at the fastest pace in six months, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits jumped by 32,000 to 360,000. That was the biggest jump since November and confounded analysts' expectations for a more modest increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think there's plenty of slack in the labor market,'' said Tanweer Akram, an economist with ING U.S. Investment Management in Atlanta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Futures indexes for United States stocks turned lower after the data's publication, and so did yields on government debt. The dollar weakened against the euro and the yen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Labor Department analyst said no states had estimated their data, and there were no signs that furloughs for government employees had played a significant role in last week's increase in claims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy has shown signs that growth slowed late in the first quarter and in April as Washington's push to trim the budget deficit weighed on consumers and businesses. The federal government raised taxes in January, and sweeping budget cuts were initiated in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many analysts have noted that a reluctance by employers to lay off workers has made an outsize contribution to recent improvements in employment levels. Last month, employers added 165,000 new jobs while the unemployment rate dropped to a four-year low at 7.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing has also been an economic bright spot, but a separate report showed groundbreaking for new homes fell more than expected in April. The Commerce Department said starts at building sites for homes fell 16.5 percent last month. Still, permits to build new homes increased, a reassuring indication that the housing sector could still contribute to the economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a third report, a sharp drop in gasoline costs led consumer prices to tumble in April by the most in over four years, while a gauge of underlying inflation was also weak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index slipped 0.4 percent, the biggest decline since December 2008 when America was suffering some of the worst days of its financial crisis. Analysts had expected a more modest 0.2 percent decline in last month's prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 12 months through April, consumer prices rose 1.1 percent. That is well below the Fed's 2 percent inflation goal. Much of April's decline in prices was because of an 8.1 percent dive in gasoline costs, the biggest since December 2008.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the housing market continues its recovery, prospective home buyers in some areas may have found, much to their dismay, that the inventory of houses for sale is somewhat limited, and sellers are receiving multiple offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent analysis by the real estate site Zillow[http://www.zillowblog.com/research/2013/05/06/inventory-constraints-are-easing/], for instance, found that while some improvement has occurred, the inventory of homes for sale nationally in April was down about 14 percent from the same time last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, meanwhile, also reported a decrease in inventory [http://www.realtor.com/data-portal/Real-Estate-Statistics.aspx?source=web]in many markets compared with a year ago. Some markets saw drops of 20 percent or more, indicating “near record lows” of available homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Specifics vary by market, of course, and there are also some signs that the lack of inventory is easing this spring, as home values have risen, Zillow found. Rising values bring more sellers off the sidelines, putting more homes on the market. Many owners have been waiting to sell because their homes are still “underwater,” or worth less than their mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Cenci, broker with ERA Martin &amp; Associates in Chillicothe, Ohio, said buyers need to be aware that the market is changing. Sometimes home shoppers are confused, he said, because there appear to be a lot of houses listed for sale, but many are actually under contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They think there’s plenty of&nbsp; houses, and that they can find what they want and get a great price,” he said. But that’s not necessarily the case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what should a home shopper do, in a market where inventories are tight, and there may be competition for some homes?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cenci recommended that if you are eager to buy and have found a home you really want, you make your offer as strong as possible — even if that means going a bit above the asking price. If you have time to shop around, you can be a bit more aggressive — that is, lower — in your offer. But, “If they need to move and they find house they love, they shouldn’t be afraid to make a good offer,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another way to show a buyer that you are serious, and to set your offer apart from other buyers’, is to increase the amount of earnest money you put up with your offer.&nbsp; The money goes toward your down payment if your offer is accepted, and is returned to you if the seller declines your offer. (Of course, if your offer is accepted and you back out, you lose your earnest money. So again, it makes sense to up the ante only if you’re confident that you want the house.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you think there’s a chance you won’t go through with the purchase, he said, save everyone a lot of time and “don’t make the offer.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also makes sense to consider the type of mortgage you will use, according to ERA. While some buyers are attracted to F.H.A. loans because they typically require lower down payments, a conventional mortgage may be more attractive to a seller. That’s because the requirements for the condition of the property are often tougher for F.H.A. loans, so some sellers may be wary of being asked to make repairs before the sale can proceed. If you can swing a higher down payment, a conventional mortgage may help your offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, limiting the number of contingencies in your offer — whether they are related to financing, inspections or other conditions — will strengthen your offer, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are you in the market for a home? Have you had difficulty finding a house, or encountered competition for your chosen property?</p>

</div><div class="author">By AMY CORTESE </div><div>1610 words</div><div>15 May 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDThe practice of crowdfunding real estate is spreading from South America -- where Prodigy Network recently raised around $239 million from 3,100 Colombians to build a 66-story skyscraper in Bogotá -- to New York, where the developer Urban Muse is hoping to offer a slice of a Brooklyn Bridge Park project to the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking a page from Web sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, real estate upstarts like Fundrise, Property Peers, Realty Mogul and Prodigy Network, which is based in New York, are transforming the way real estate projects are built and who profits from them, by allowing the public to invest in an asset class that has traditionally been the exclusive domain of wealthy investors and private equity firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a very simple concept,'' said Daniel Miller, co-founder of Fundrise. ''You should be able to invest in your neighborhood.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Miller, 25, and his brother Benjamin, 36, are the pioneers behind Fundrise, a Web platform that lets communities invest in local real estate projects. Sons of a prominent developer in the Washington area, the brothers began wondering a few years ago why people in a community, like the transitional H Street NE neighborhood, couldn't have more of a say in what was being built there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They realized that who the investors are and where the money comes from determine what gets built: distant private equity backers who see a deal as simply an investment vehicle tend to put up cookie-cutter projects and strip malls anchored by chain stores -- hardly what the community may want or need.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Who your money is affects what you build, but no one ever thinks about that,'' said Benjamin Miller, who also co-founded a site called Popularise that lets developers solicit input from the community. ''We're taking an institutional asset and changing who gets to invest in it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A faded two-story brick building on Washington's H Street seems an unlikely site for a revolution. But the unassuming structure -- at 906 H Street NE -- on Monday became the latest commercial development project to be open to public investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial stakes in the renovation project were offered to residents of Washington and Virginia on Fundrise.com. By Tuesday morning, investors had snapped up 1,500 shares priced at $100 a share. All told, 3,500 shares were offered to the public -- or 25 percent of the project cost (the rest was raised from private investors and West Mill Capital, the Millers' development firm).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cameron Cook, a 25-year-old project manager and Web developer who lives close to H Street NE, was among the first to invest, paying $1,000 for 10 shares. In addition to the potential financial gain -- an estimated 7 percent annual dividend from rental revenue plus appreciation in the property -- he was drawn to the novelty of the idea and the ability to directly take part in the neighborhood's revival. ''I think it's cool that the community can be more in control of what's happening around them,'' Mr. Cook said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That seemingly simple idea is actually a radical departure from conventional practice, and requires some financial and regulatory gymnastics. Under current law, only wealthy ''accredited'' investors (typically those with a net worth of $1 million or more) are allowed to invest in private firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But recent changes to securities laws ushered in by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, signed into law in April 2012, will soon make it much easier for the Millers and other new-breed developers to ''crowdfund'' real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under that law, unaccredited investors may invest up to $2,000 a year, or 5 percent of their income or net worth (whichever is greater), in private firms, like a real estate limited liability company, as long as the investment takes place on a site or broker-dealer registered with the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span>. The law, however, has been bogged down at the S.E.C., which missed an end-of-year deadline to complete rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until then, crowdfunding companies must either restrict investments to accredited investors or, as Fundrise has done, register each development project with the S.E.C. -- a process that can take months and tens of thousands of dollars. For now, says Benjamin Miller, offerings are being subsidized to prove the concept. But the brothers hope that eventually the process of offering shares to the public will become much easier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of their first projects, 1351 H Street NE, a tear-down building in Washington's H Street Northeast neighborhood, will include a Taiwanese ramen restaurant run by a chef with a local following, food stalls and a retail shop -- an idiosyncratic project that would have been a hard sell for conventional investors. But scores of neighborhood residents were happy to invest an average of $2,000 each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That first deal took three months to close. A subsequent offering -- for $320,000 worth of shares in 1539 Seventh Street NW, a 3,600-square-foot building in the Shaw neighborhood -- sold out in three hours. And the 906 H Street deal was on track to sell out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investing public will also benefit from appreciation of the property -- a new streetcar line that will run down H Street is expected to accelerate a revival already under way and bolster real estate values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gina Schafer, the owner of several Ace hardware stores in the Washington area, invested in two Fundrise projects. ''I thought it was cool the minute I saw it,'' she said. ''We don't own our hardware store spaces, because real estate is so expensive here, but wish we could.'' The H Street projects are ''a way for us to get involved in the crazy D.C. real estate market and support our local community.'' She said that her first dividend payment was on its way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lately, the Miller brothers have been to New York, where they talked with local developers about using the Fundrise platform on community-scale projects in the $500,000 to $1 million range. They have been in touch with Jason Goodman, the chief executive of Third Ward, the co-working space that is building a 30,000 square-foot commercial kitchen and incubator in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, and Dan Biederman, the developer behind the Bryant Park revival.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their first New York partnership, they teamed up with Glauco Lolli-Ghetti, founder and principal of Urban Muse, to bid for rights to develop the John Street parcel on the northern edge of the Brooklyn Bridge Park development project. The site, a fenced-in lot adjacent to the Manhattan Bridge, is zoned for up to 130 residential units as well as ground-floor retail. Mr. Lolli-Ghetti envisions a 120,000-square foot building designed by <span class="companylink">Snohetta</span>, which created the Norwegian Opera House and the September 11 Memorial and Museum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the joint bid, Urban Muse would allow New Yorkers to invest up to $1 million in the retail component. ''Retail is such an amenity, I wanted it to be woven into the community,'' said Mr. Lolli-Ghetti, although he worries that city officials handling the request for proposals may consider public participation ''a gimmick.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's not sure crowdfunding is suited to large, complex projects. ''In real estate, $10 million to $20 million projects are easy. But if you need $500,000 to buy a (small) property and put a local tenant on the street floor, you can't do it. It's too small for private equity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Goodman of Third Ward, the co-working and educational space in Bushwick, is a long-term leaseholder who said owning the building through usual lending would require putting 50 percent down in cash -- or $7.5 million, an amount out of reach for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying it with the help of small investors is ''something we've started to explore again,'' he said. (Its Crown Heights commercial kitchen project opening next year is largely financed by <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Third Ward mailing list of 80,000 people, 3,000 members, 15 investors and thousands of students who have taken classes there over the last six years could be a ready investor base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Many of them would be very interested in different ways of participating,'' Mr. Goodman said. ''This is game-changing for small businesses like ours but also for the neighborhood. It's bottom-up development instead of top-down, and that is totally unique. Nobody understands a neighborhood better than the people who live there or are stakeholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To me, it's like, why hasn't this already happened?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: May 16, 2013, Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption with an article on the Square Feet pages on Wednesday about crowdfunding for development projects described incorrectly the status of a joint venture between Fundrise, a Web platform that raises such funds, and the New York real estate developer Urban Muse. The venture is bidding on the right to develop a parcel adjacent to the Manhattan Bridge; it has not started development. The article also misstated the proximity of Fundrise's project at 1351 H Street NE in Washington to Dupont Circle in that city. It is more than three miles from Dupont Circle; it is not ''near.''</p>
<p>In a joint venture, the Washingtonbased Fundrise began to develop a  lot near the Manhattan Bridge,  above. Fundrise is operated by Daniel Miller, left, and Benjamin Miller. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY CHESTER HIGGINS Jr./THE NEW YORK TIMES; VANESSA VICK FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trophy high-rises on Madison, Park and Fifth Avenues in Manhattan have long commanded the top prices in the country for commercial real estate, with yearly leases approaching $150 a square foot. So it is quite a Gotham-size comedown that businesses are now paying rents four times that in low, bland buildings across the Hudson River in New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why pay $600 or more a square foot at unglamorous addresses like Weehawken, Secaucus and Mahwah? The answer is still location, location, location -- but of a very different sort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies are paying top dollar to lease space there in buildings called data centers, the anonymous warrens where more and more of the world's commerce is transacted, all of which has added up to a tremendous boon for the business of data centers themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The centers provide huge banks of remote computer storage, and the enormous amounts of electrical power and ultrafast fiber optic links that they demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are particularly steep in northern New Jersey because it is also where data centers house the digital guts of the New York Stock Exchange and other markets. Bankers and high-frequency traders are vying to have their computers, or servers, as close as possible to those markets. Shorter distances make for quicker trades, and microseconds can mean millions of dollars made or lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the centers opened in the 1990s as quaintly termed ''Internet hotels,'' the tenants paid for space to plug in their servers with a proviso that electricity would be available. As computing power has soared, so has the need for power, turning that relationship on its head: electrical capacity is often the central element of lease agreements, and space is secondary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A result, an examination shows, is that the industry has evolved from a purveyor of space to an energy broker -- making tremendous profits by reselling access to electrical power, and in some cases raising questions of whether the industry has become a kind of wildcat power utility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though a single data center can deliver enough electricity to power a medium-size town, regulators have granted the industry some of the financial benefits accorded the real estate business and imposed none of the restrictions placed on the profits of power companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the biggest data center companies have won or are seeking <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> approval to organize themselves as real estate investment trusts, allowing them to eliminate most corporate taxes. At the same time, the companies have not drawn the scrutiny of utility regulators, who normally set prices for delivery of the power to residences and businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While companies have widely different lease structures, with prices ranging from under $200 to more than $1,000 a square foot, the industry's performance on Wall Street has been remarkable. <span class="companylink">Digital Realty</span> Trust, the first major data center company to organize as a real estate trust, has delivered a return of more than 700 percent since its initial public offering in 2004, according to an analysis by Green Street Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock price of another leading company, Equinix, which owns one of the prime northern New Jersey complexes and is seeking to become a real estate trust, more than doubled last year to over $200.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Their business has grown incredibly rapidly,'' said John Stewart, a senior analyst at Green Street. ''They arrived at the scene right as demand for data storage and growth of the Internet were exploding.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Push for Leasing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many businesses own their own data centers -- from stacks of servers jammed into a back office to major stand-alone facilities -- the growing sophistication, cost and power needs of the systems are driving companies into leased spaces at a breakneck pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York metro market now has the most rentable square footage in the nation, at 3.2 million square feet, according to a recent report by 451 Research, an industry consulting firm. It is followed by the Washington and Northern Virginia area, and then by San Francisco and Silicon Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A major orthopedics practice in Atlanta illustrates how crucial these data centers have become.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With 21 clinics scattered around Atlanta, Resurgens Orthopaedics has some 900 employees, including 170 surgeons, therapists and other caregivers who treat everything from fractured spines to plantar fasciitis. But its technological engine sits in a roughly 250-square-foot cage within a gigantic building that was once a Sears distribution warehouse and is now a data center operated by <span class="companylink">Quality Technology Services</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eight or nine racks of servers process and store every digital medical image, physician's schedule and patient billing record at Resurgens, said Bradley Dick, chief information officer at the company. Traffic on the clinics' 1,600 telephones is routed through the same servers, Mr. Dick said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That is our business,'' Mr. Dick said. ''If those systems are down, it's going to be a bad day.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The center steadily burns 25 million to 32 million watts, said Brian Johnston, the chief technology officer for Quality Technology. That is roughly the amount needed to power 15,000 homes, according to the Electric Power Research Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dick said that 75 percent of Resurgens's lease was directly related to power -- essentially for access to about 30 power sockets. He declined to cite a specific dollar amount, but two brokers familiar with the operation said that Resurgens was probably paying a rate of about $600 per square foot a year, which would mean it is paying over $100,000 a year simply to plug its servers into those jacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While lease arrangements are often written in the language of real estate,''these are power deals, essentially,'' said Scott Stein, senior vice president of the data center solutions group at <span class="companylink">Cassidy Turley</span>, a commercial real estate firm. ''These are about getting power for your servers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One key to the profit reaped by some data centers is how they sell access to power. Troy Tazbaz, a data center design engineer at <span class="companylink">Oracle</span> who previously worked at Equinix and elsewhere in the industry, said that behind the flat monthly rate for a socket was a lucrative calculation. Tenants contract for access to more electricity than they actually wind up needing. But many data centers charge tenants as if they were using all of that capacity -- in other words, full price for power that is available but not consumed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since tenants on average tend to contract for around twice the power they need, Mr. Tazbaz said, those data centers can effectively charge double what they are paying for that power. Generally, the sale or resale of power is subject to a welter of regulations and price controls. For regulated utilities, the average ''return on equity'' -- a rough parallel to profit margins -- was 9.25 percent to 9.7 percent for 2010 through 2012, said Lillian Federico, president of Regulatory Research Associates, a division of SNL Energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators Unaware</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the capacity pricing by data centers, which emerged in interviews with engineers and others in the industry as well as an examination of corporate documents, appears not to have registered with utility regulators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interviews with regulators in several states revealed widespread lack of understanding about the amount of electricity used by data centers or how they profit by selling access to power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bernie Neenan, a former utility official now at the Electric Power Research Institute, said that an industry operating outside the reach of utility regulators and making profits by reselling access to electricity would be a troubling precedent. Utility regulations ''are trying to avoid a landslide'' of other businesses doing the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some data center companies, including <span class="companylink">Digital Realty</span> Trust and <span class="companylink">DuPont Fabros Technology</span>, charge tenants for the actual amount of electricity consumed and then add a fee calculated on capacity or square footage. Those deals, often for larger tenants, usually wind up with lower effective prices per square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless of the pricing model, Chris Crosby, chief executive of the Dallas-based Compass Datacenters, said that since data centers also provided protection from surges and power failures with backup generators, they could not be viewed as utilities. That backup equipment ''is why people pay for our business,'' Mr. Crosby said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melissa Neumann, a spokeswoman for Equinix, said that in the company's leases, ''power, cooling and space are very interrelated.'' She added, ''It's simply not accurate to look at power in isolation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Neumann and officials at the other companies said their practices could not be construed as reselling electrical power at a profit and that data centers strictly respected all utility codes. Alex Veytsel, chief strategy officer at RampRate, which advises companies on data center, network and support services, said tenants were beginning to resist flat-rate pricing for access to sockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think market awareness is getting better,'' Mr. Veytsel said. ''And certainly there are a lot of people who know they are in a bad situation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Equinix Story</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The soaring business of data centers is exemplified by Equinix. Founded in the late 1990s, it survived what Jason Starr, director of investor relations, called a ''near death experience'' when the Internet bubble burst. Then it began its stunning rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equinix's giant data center in Secaucus is mostly dark except for lights flashing on servers stacked on black racks enclosed in cages. For all its eerie solitude, it is some of the most coveted space on the planet for financial traders. A few miles north, in an unmarked building on a street corner in Mahwah, sit the servers that move trades on the New York Stock Exchange; an almost equal distance to the south, in Carteret, are Nasdaq's servers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data center's attraction for tenants is a matter of physics: data, which is transmitted as light pulses through fiber optic cables, can travel no faster than about a foot every billionth of a second. So being close to so many markets lets traders operate with little time lag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Starr said: ''We're beachfront property.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Standing before a bank of servers, Mr. Starr explained that they belonged to one of the lesser-known exchanges located in the Secaucus data center. Multicolored fiber-optic cables drop from an overhead track into the cage, which allows servers of traders and other financial players elsewhere on the floor to monitor and react nearly instantaneously to the exchange. It all creates a dense and unthinkably fast ecosystem of postmodern finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quoting some lyrics by Soul Asylum, Mr. Starr said, ''Nothing attracts a crowd like a crowd.'' By any measure, Equinix has attracted quite a crowd. With more than 90 facilities, it is the top data center leasing company in the world, according to 451 Research. Last year, it reported revenue of $1.9 billion and $145 million in profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the ability to expand, according to the company's financial filings, is partly dependent on fulfilling the growing demands for electricity. The company's most recent annual report said that ''customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet,'' its term for data center space. It also noted that given the increase in electrical use and the age of some of its centers, ''the current demand for power may exceed the designed electrical capacity in these centers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To enhance its business, Equinix has announced plans to restructure itself as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, which, after substantial transition costs, would eventually save the company more than $100 million in taxes annually, according to Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen &amp; Company, an investment banking firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress created REITs in the early 1960s, modeling them on mutual funds, to open real estate investments to ordinary investors, said Timothy M. Toy, a New York lawyer who has written about the history of the trusts. Real estate companies organized as investment trusts avoid corporate taxes by paying out most of their income as dividends to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equinix is seeking a so-called private letter ruling from the I.R.S. to restructure itself, a move that has drawn criticism from tax watchdogs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is an incredible example of how tax avoidance has become a major business strategy,'' said Ryan Alexander, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan budget watchdog. The I.R.S., she said, ''is letting people broaden these definitions in a way that they kind of create the image of a loophole.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equinix, some analysts say, is further from the definition of a real estate trust than other data center companies operating as trusts, like <span class="companylink">Digital Realty</span> Trust. As many as 80 of its 97 data centers are in buildings it leases, Equinix said. The company then, in effect, sublets the buildings to numerous tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, Mr. Synesael said the I.R.S. has been inclined to view recurring revenue like lease payments as ''good REIT income.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Neumann, the Equinix spokeswoman, said, ''The REIT framework is designed to apply to real estate broadly, whether owned or leased.'' She added that converting to a real estate trust ''offers tax efficiencies and disciplined returns to shareholders while also allowing us to preserve growth characteristics of Equinix and create significant shareholder value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cloud Factories: Articles in this series are examining the physical structures that make up the cloud, and their impact on our environment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many reasons to be bullish on housing. Valuations, affordability and supply and demand are moving in the right direction. But there are also causes for concern. Home sales and home prices can rise only so far given today’s high level of unemployment and low level of wage gains. And millions of homeowners are still in financial distress. At the end of 2012, some 11.3 million homeowners — nearly one-fourth of all those with a mortgage — still owed more on their mortgages than their homes were worth, according to <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> Analytics. Of those, three million are currently in or near foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Against that backdrop, President Obama has nominated[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/02/business/obama-to-name-melvin-watt-to-oversee-fannie-and-freddie.html] Representative Melvin Watt[http://watt.house.gov/], a Democrat of North Carolina, to be the next director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency[http://www.fhfa.gov/], the overseer of the government-backed mortgage companies <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee[http://financialservices.house.gov/], Mr. Watt has long been a champion of homeownership and credit availability. Before credit standards were abandoned in the lending of the bubble years, careful efforts by Mr. Watt and other policy makers had prudently expanded homeownership to middle- and low-income families, without the negative consequences of the subprime era. Reviving those successful efforts, while averting the dangers, should be a priority for the next director of the agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a representative from North Carolina, whose district includes parts of Charlotte, the home of <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, Mr. Watt is also aware of the needs and demands of banks. He has been criticized for taking campaign donations from the financial industry, though, sadly, it is hard to find a politician who doesn’t accept special-interest money. But Mr. Watt has shown a willingness to act in the public interest — and to compromise skillfully across the aisle. During debates over the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill in 2010, he was instrumental in passing core mortgage reforms, including rules to improve and enforce underwriting standards to protect borrowers and the public from reckless lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question, of course, is whether Mr. Watt can be confirmed in a Senate where Republicans block nominees for the sake of doing so. For some time, many Republicans have insisted that the most important housing issue is the privatization of Fannie and Freddie, which have been under government control since their bailout in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debate over the future of Fannie and Freddie is legitimate, but premature. Currently, Fannie and Freddie and other federal agencies guarantee about 90 percent of new mortgages. Banks and other private sector lenders are simply in no position to fill that role anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A confirmation hearing should focus on the real, near-term priorities for Fannie and Freddie, especially the need to ensure the flow of ample mortgage credit and to provide relief to hard-pressed borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current acting director, Edward DeMarco, has been slow to clarify mortgage issues that impair the banks’ willingness to extend credit. He has also stood in the way of principal reductions for underwater borrowers, saying that writing off principal would be against the taxpayer interest. Mr. Watt’s record indicates that he would take a smarter, more forceful approach to mortgage relief. Research by the <span class="companylink">Congressional Budget Office</span> confirms that principal write-downs would save the government money and reduce foreclosure and delinquency rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Watt has what it takes to explain and carry out policies to help revive credit and provide long overdue assistance to homeowners — if only the Senate will give him the chance.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What gives? Where are the missing construction workers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those are questions that economists have been puzzling over for the last year or so, as the housing market has started to normalize, with low inventory and new demand causing prices to rise in markets across the country and builders eagerly breaking ground on new developments from Florida to California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over time that should lead to rising employment in the sector, especially given pent-up demand for projects. But not yet. Construction employment is starting to turn up[http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=i2Z], but from a very low level: There are about as many construction workers now as there were in 1997. And construction employment in the residential sector remains essentially flat, gaining about 2.5 percent in the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There seem to be a few components to the answer. The first is that housing starts tend to tell us where the market for construction workers is going, not where it is right now. So even as starts have surged as builders have begun new projects, the overall number of units under construction remains relatively low – meaning relatively few available jobs. (See <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>’s chief economist, Jed Kolko, on this point[http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2013/01/kolko-here-are-missing-construction-jobs.html].)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, it seems that builders in some markets may be having trouble recruiting skilled workers, as my colleague Catherine Rampell recently reported[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/business/economy/in-us-surprise-housing-demand-catches-industry-off-guard.html?pagewanted=all]. That has not yet led to much of a surge in compensation[http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=i2Q] in the sector, as you might expect. But perhaps the businesses are paying workers under the table, or making do with fewer of them, in part by increasing their hours[http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=i2X].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, builders will eventually need to hire employees to work on new projects. (As far as I know, there have not been any great productivity advances in home building in the past few years, and nobody’s outsourcing the work to robots.) That would be a good thing for an economy still desperately in need of jobs[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/04/business/economy/us-adds-165000-jobs-in-april.html?hp], despite the better numbers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MIAMI — Of the 22,000 condos created in downtown Miami during the boom years, only about 600 remain unsold — thanks mainly to an influx of Latin American investors seeking a safe haven for their money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers are reacting to the unexpectedly swift condo recovery in a predictable way: they are building more condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most ambitious project by far is the $1.05 billion Brickell CityCentre, a 5.4-million-square-foot mixed-use development that will add about 800 condo units in two 43-story towers to the central business district, a hotel, a luxury movie theater, and a wellness center aimed at tourists from Latin America. With the Brickell CityCentre, the downtown neighborhood will have its first upscale shopping center and its first office building since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Miami construction boom — with its own local idiosyncrasies — comes after a broad revival in the real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As demand rises and supply shrinks, cities around the country are experiencing a residential rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, national home prices jumped by 9.3 percent over the same month a year ago, the highest growth rate since May 2006, according to data released on Tuesday by the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index, which measures 20 major cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami fared better than most, with home values rising by 10.4 percent. The local condo market, which is not counted in the Case-Shiller data, is equally robust. Prices of condos in downtown Miami increased to $440 a square foot in the last quarter, compared with $400 in the same quarter a year ago, according to Condo Vultures, a local brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With foreign buyers scooping up properties, developers are trying to capitalize on the demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last two years, 25 new condo projects have been announced in the downtown area, although it is far from certain they will all be completed. Within sight of Brickell CityCentre alone, eight residential buildings are under construction, including three being developed by the Related Group, an affiliate of the Related Companies of New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We seem to be on the cusp of another boom,” said Peter Zalewski, a principal at Condo Vultures. “The question is whether this will be a controlled boom or another out-of-control boom, which is what we’re known for.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers of Brickell CityCentre, <span class="companylink">Swire Properties</span>, a division of the Hong Kong conglomerate with deep roots in Miami, are trying to balance the various market forces. While the residential market is looking healthier, demand for office space is still weak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Swire also sees a strong need for high-end shopping in the rapidly growing downtown neighborhood. The company’s partner in the 500,000-square-foot retail component at Brickell CityCentre is the Whitman family, the owners of Bal Harbour Shops, a hugely successful open-air shopping center just north of Miami Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the office side, Swire is remaining cautious. The vacancy rate in the city’s financial district is well into the double digits at roughly 16.7 percent, according to CBRE, a real estate services firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Swire hopes eventually to include an office tower with 750,000 square feet, but for now, the office component of the project will contain only 120,000 square feet. Diana L. Parker, a senior vice president at CBRE, said the new office space would be available just as a number of leases downtown were expiring. “Their timing is impeccable,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plans for Brickell CityCentre reflect Miami’s desire to bring its downtown in line with trends occurring in business districts across the country, where developers are being encouraged to provide convenience to public transportation, street-level retail and underground parking. Occupying four blocks, the Brickell CityCentre is next to the 8th Street station serving Metromover, a free transit line that circulates downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen L. Owens, president of Swire, said his company had been looking at the location, known as West Brickell, since 2006 when two of the sites were listed for sale at $110 million. Two years later, Swire paid $41 million for those properties, which were vacant except for several dozen 100-year-old oak trees. (The trees were uprooted and transported by barge to Museum Park on the other side of the Miami River.) Subsequently, Swire added to its assemblage by buying the Brickell Tennis Center and 799 Brickell Plaza.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That gave Swire 9.1 acres — slightly more than it needed to qualify as a special area under Miami’s new zoning code. This designation enabled the developer to work with the city to create a master plan that includes improvements to the streets and sidewalks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials are allowing Swire to build two bridges to make it easier for shoppers to travel from one building to another. These bridges will house shops and cafes, Mr. Owens said. “The biggest challenge was connectivity,” he said. Many urban planners, however, frown on such bridges because they draw foot traffic away from sidewalk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Swire also won approval to build something rare in Miami — an underground parking lot with 1,600 spaces for the project’s commercial components. Shoppers will of course have the option of taking the Metromover and getting off at the 8th Street station, which Swire is also renovating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Miami is not exactly known for its public transportation, ridership on both Metromover and Metrorail, an elevated train that connects suburbs north and south of Miami, has been steadily increasing — up 5.5 percent and 11.3 percent in February over the same period in the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increased usage, in part, comes after an influx of young residents to downtown. The recent condo boom was driven primarily by cash-paying Latin American investors who either use the apartments occasionally or rent them out, often to young professionals working nearby, said Mr. Zalewski of Condo Vultures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Swire’s focus on high-end shopping also happened to coincide with a new direction in the Whitmans’ business. Since Bal Harbour Shops opened in 1965, the family had luxury shopping almost exclusively to itself and fought strenuously to keep tenants from opening other stores in the area. The Whitmans say sales last year at Bal Harbour Shops — their lone shopping center — were $2,810 a square foot, compared to a national average of $526.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But more recently, several longtime tenants, including Louis Vuitton, Cartier and Hermès, have decamped to the Design District across Biscayne Bay. Luxury shops are also opening at Aventura Mall, just north of Miami.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the competitive landscape changing, the Whitmans decided to expand by investing in Brickell CityCentre. “We see that area as a strong residential community with a thriving tourist market that is only getting stronger,” said Matthew Whitman Lazenby, the operating partner of Bal Harbour Shops and a grandson of the company’s founder, Stanley Whitman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shopping center is being designed so that shoppers will feel the breezes off Biscayne Bay, just as they do at Bal Harbour. A glass trellis will “protect you from the outside elements but let you have a natural al fresco experience,” Mr. Owens said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This will be our Rockefeller Center,” said Robert Kaplan, a principal with the Miami Beach office of Ackman-Ziff, a New York-based mortgage brokerage, referring to the Brickell CityCentre. “We don’t have anything like that here.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Home prices rose in February at their fastest rate in almost seven years, another sign the housing market recovery will help counter the drag on the economy from government belt-tightening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case Shiller index[http://www.standardandpoors.com/servlet/BlobServer?blobheadername3=MDT-Type&amp;blobcol=urldocumentfile&amp;blobtable=SPComSecureDocument&amp;blobheadervalue2=inline%3B+filename%3Ddownload.pdf&amp;blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&amp;blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobheadername1=content-type&amp;blobwhere=1245350915749&amp;blobheadervalue3=abinary%3B+charset%3DUTF-8&amp;blobnocache=true] of 20 metropolitan areas released on Tuesday showed single-family home prices rose 9.3 percent in February from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data reinforces the view that rising home prices could make Americans feel better about spending this year, helping counter a blow to economic growth from tax increases and government spending cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This will be a powerful positive fundamental, not only for housing, but presumably helpful for consumer spending as well,” said Stephen Stanley an economist at <span class="companylink">Pierpont Securities</span> in Stamford, Conn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report showed consumer confidence rebounded in April as Americans felt better about the outlook for the economy and their income prospects. The Conference Board, a private industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes rose[http://www.conference-board.org/press/pressdetail.cfm?pressid=4800] to 68.1 from a revised 61.9 the previous month. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 60.8.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there appears to be a growing risk that weakness in the labor market and broader economy could dial down the housing recovery’s strength. Hiring slowed drastically in March and economic growth was lackluster in the first quarter, raising fear that the economy could struggle to cope with Washington’s austerity drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business activity in the Midwest unexpectedly contracted in April to its lowest level since September 2009 as a gauge of employment declined, another report showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago business barometer fell[https://www.ism-chicago.org/chapters/ism-ismchicago/files/ChicagoPMI-13-04.pdf] to 49, below the 50 mark that denotes contraction and falling short of economists’ expectations for 52.5.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technology companies led the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span> 500-stock index to a new closing high on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock market has recovered all the ground it lost over the previous two weeks, when worries over slower economic growth, falling commodity prices and disappointing quarterly earnings battered financial markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.&amp; P. 500 index rose 11.37 points, to close at 1,593.61. The 0.7 percent increase nudged the index above its previous closing high of 1,593.36, reached on April 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The market has had a terrific run,” said Philip Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors, noting that the S.&amp; P. 500 is up 12 percent since the start of 2013. “At the beginning of the year, I thought we were going to 1,660,” he said, referring to all of 2013. “We’re only about 5 percent from that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A pair of economic reports encouraged buying. Wages and spending rose in the United States last month, and pending home sales hit their highest level in three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones industrial average gained 106.20 points, to 14,818.75, up 0.7 percent. <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> and I.B.M. were among the Dow’s best performers, rising more than 2 percent each. I.B.M. alone accounted for a third of the Dow’s increase. The index is just 46 points below its own nominal high of 14,865 reached on April 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technology’s popularity on Monday was a change from earlier this month, when it lagged the rest of the market. Concerns about weak business spending and slower overseas sales have cast a shadow over big tech firms, said Marty Leclerc, the managing partner of Barrack Yard Advisors, an investment firm in Bryn Mawr, Pa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue misses from I.B.M. and other big companies have highlighted the technology industry’s vulnerability to the world economy. But Mr. Leclerc says he thinks companies with steady revenue and plenty of cash look appealing over the long term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Information technology stocks rose the most of the 10 industry groups in the S.&amp; P. on Monday, up 1.6 percent. It is the only group that remains lower over the last year, down 2 percent, against the S.&amp;.P’s gain of 14 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> composite rose 27.76 points to 3,307.02, an increase of 0.9 percent. Apple, the biggest stock in the index, surged 3 percent to $430.12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of Americans who signed contracts to buy homes reached the highest level since April 2010, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Back then, a tax credit for buying houses lifted sales. In a separate report, the government said Americans’ spending and income both edged up last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A handful of companies reported earnings on Monday. The <span class="companylink">Eaton Corporation</span>’s quarterly net income beat Wall Street estimates, helped by its acquisition of <span class="companylink">Cooper Industries</span>, an electrical equipment supplier, though its revenue fell short. Eaton shares climbed 3 percent to $60.28.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eaton’s results followed a larger pattern this earnings season. Of the 274 companies that have turned in results, seven of 10 have beaten analysts’ estimates for earnings, according to <span class="companylink">S&amp;P Capital</span> IQ. But when it comes to revenue, six of 10 have missed estimates. The divergence suggests companies are squeezing more profits out of cost-cutting, instead of higher sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">McGraw-Hill</span>, the parent company of <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> and <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span>, surged after news that the ratings agencies had settled lawsuits dating back to the financial crisis that accused them of concealing risky investments. <span class="companylink">McGraw-Hill</span> gained 3 percent to $53.45, while <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> jumped 8 percent to $59.69, the biggest gain in the S.&amp; P. 500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the market for government bonds, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was barely changed, falling 1/32 from Friday to 103, while its yield was even at 1.67 percent.</p>

</div><div class="author">By ROBERT SHAROFF </div><div>1135 words</div><div>24 April 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROSEMONT, Ill. -- A new outlet mall under construction here -- the first enclosed mall to be built in the Chicago area in over a decade -- is both a departure for the outlet industry and a major new attraction for this close-in Chicago suburb long known as a convention and business hub.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $250 million mall, Fashion Outlets of Chicago, is scheduled to open this summer. The two-level, 530,000-square-foot center is being co-developed by AWE Talisman, a Florida-based company that also owns outlet centers in Las Vegas and Santa Fe, N.M., and the <span class="companylink">Macerich Company</span> of Santa Monica, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The project is a game changer on several levels,'' said Arthur Weiner, chairman of AWE Talisman. ''We're in a prized area with a higher level of construction and amenities than you would normally see at an outlet center. We also have a pretty good store list.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mall, which is 90 percent leased, is focused on luxury retailers like <span class="companylink">Saks Fifth Avenue</span>'s Off 5th, Last Call by <span class="companylink">Neiman Marcus</span>, Bloomingdale's the Outlet Store and Barneys New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, there are outlets by top fashion names like Prada, Gucci, <span class="companylink">Giorgio Armani</span>, Tory Burch and Michael Kors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developer and the retailers hope to shake up Chicago's retail scene with the new mall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To date, outlet stores have not been very prominent in the Chicago area, with the nearest outlet center -- Chicago Premium Outlets in Aurora, Ill. -- about 40 miles from downtown Chicago. But Rosemont is a closer suburb and only 20 minutes from Chicago's Michigan Avenue, where all of the above stores have thriving full-price locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arnie Orlick, senior vice president of outlets for Bloomingdale's, said that the mall's focus on luxury -- one of the fastest-growing segments of the outlet market -- bodes well for the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When all of these retailers go into a mall,'' he said, ''you know they're going to attract many more customers than a traditional outlet center.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil Stern, senior partner with McMillanDoolittle, a Chicago-based retail consulting firm, said that the mall reflected a shift in the outlet business. ''There used to be a clear divide between outlets and regular retail, but that doesn't really exist anymore,'' he said. ''Today we're seeing outlets that are almost the equivalent of full-line stores.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Specifically, outlets used to be places where retailers and manufacturers disposed of closeout and past-season goods. Today, however, they tend to be separate divisions within their companies and tend to have their own supply chains and customer bases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the same brands and labels but they've engineered the process to get the price points more in line with the outlet environment,'' said Mr. Stern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Wallstrom, president of Saks's Off 5th outlet division, said that Off 5th was merchandised for a different customer than <span class="companylink">Saks</span>'s regular stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's some crossover between the full-price and off-price customers, but it's only about 10 percent,'' he said. ''What we're trying to create is a luxury value department store.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The location is also a departure. In the past, outlet centers were often bare-bones affairs located far from major population centers. Fashion Outlets, however, is a quick drive from downtown Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're excited about it,'' said Wayne A. Hussey, senior vice president of properties and store development at <span class="companylink">Neiman Marcus</span>. ''Rosemont is an amazing area in terms of the critical mass of hotels and restaurants and it's very close to the airport as well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That last comment is something of an understatement. Rosemont is not just close to O'Hare International Airport. It's literally next door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This proximity was one of the main drivers of the project, according to Mr. Weiner, of AWE Talisman. ''Outlet shopping is fueled by tourism,'' he said. ''Visitors can be 50 percent or more of the business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weiner said the mall would offer inducements for travelers. In addition to shuttle service to and from the airport, the center will also provide early check-in and baggage handing services -- for a fee. ''Our goal is to have more Fashion Outlet buses than Hertz buses circling O'Hare,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A major contributor to the mall is the village of Rosemont, which awarded the project about $50 million in grants and tax breaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also split with the State of Illinois's Toll Highway Authority the cost of a new $15 million off-ramp to the Tri-State Tollway that curves around the back of the mall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rosemont is one of the more unusual municipalities in the Chicago area. Wedged between the airport and a forest preserve and bisected by a dense web of expressways, it's an island of commerce surrounded by older bedroom communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the 840,000-square-foot Donald E. Stephens Convention Center and the 18,500-seat Allstate Arena, the two-and-a-half-square-mile village has 5,501 hotel rooms. Although only 4,200 people actually live in Rosemont, the average daytime population approaches 50,000 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Rosemont is hotels, restaurants and convention centers,'' said Rebecca Hendrick, an associate professor of public administration at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and the author of ''Managing the Fiscal Metropolis,'' a book that examines the politics and finances of various Chicago suburban communities. ''It exists primarily to provide services to people coming into O'Hare airport.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The village is also unusual in that it has had only two mayors in its 57-year history. The first was Donald E. Stephens, who founded the village in 1956 and served as mayor until his death in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second and current mayor is his son, Bradley A. Stephens. Earlier this month, the younger Mr. Stephens ran unopposed for a second four-year term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several years ago, after trying and failing to secure a casino license, the village financed the construction of <span class="companylink">MB Financial</span> Park, a new 120,000-square-foot open-air entertainment district that includes restaurants, bars, a multiplex movie theater and a bowling alley as well as a winter skating rink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The park, which cost $50 million and opened last year, is across Balmoral Avenue from the mall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stephens said the mall would ''augment'' the entertainment district and that the village planned to build a walkway to connect the two projects. The mall, he added, will serve as the village's main shopping area as well as ''a nice little cash generator for the village's general fund.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (AP) — Sales of used homes dipped in March as the supply remained tight. But the pace remained ahead of last year’s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_association_of_realtors/index.html?inline=nyt-org] said Monday that sales fell 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.92 million, from 4.95 million in February. The February figure was revised lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, sales in March were 10.3 percent higher than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales have remained mostly unchanged in the last four months — largely, analysts have said, because of a limited supply of homes. Economists still predict the housing market will continue to recover this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The low supply, combined with rising demand for housing, could accelerate construction in coming months. The Realtors’ group said buyer traffic was 25 percent higher than a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A disappointing result for U.S. existing-home sales, but with inventories still very tight, the outlook remains favorable,” Jennifer H. Lee, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A steady housing recovery is providing support to the economy this year. Builders are starting work on more homes, increasing construction jobs. And home prices are rising. Higher prices tend to make homeowners feel wealthier and encourage more spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the pace of purchases of used homes has been little changed in recent months, partly because of the tight inventory. The supply of available homes has fallen nearly 17 percent in the last year to 1.93 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales pace, that supply would be exhausted in 4.7 months, less than the six months typical in a healthy market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply rose 1.6 percent from February to March. The Realtors’ group says it expects a much bigger increase in supply this month as the spring selling season began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tight supply helps explain rising prices. The median price rose 11.8 percent from February to March to $184,300, the biggest one-month gain since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The higher median price partly reflects bigger increases in sales of more expensive homes. Sales of homes priced from $500,000 to $750,000 jumped 25.3 percent from a year earlier. By contrast, sales of homes priced from $100,000 to $250,000 rose just 7.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers, who usually drive housing recoveries, are playing a smaller role in the current rebound. They accounted for 30 percent of sales last month, the same as in February. First-time buyers usually make up about 40 percent of buyers in a healthy market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One bright sign in the report is that the percentage of so-called distressed sales fell sharply. Distressed sales include foreclosed homes and homes in which the size of the mortgage exceeds the value of the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those sales fell to 21 percent of the total in March, down from 25 percent in February. That is the lowest proportion since the Realtors’ group began tracking the figure in October 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steady hiring and near-record-low mortgage rates have helped increase sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the housing bubble burst more than six years ago, banks have imposed tighter credit conditions and required larger down payments. Those changes have left many would-be buyers unable to qualify for very low mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates dropped last week to near-record lows. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to 3.41 percent from 3.43 percent. That is not far from the record low of 3.31 percent last November.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those sales fell to 21 percent of the total in March, down from 25 percent in February. That is the lowest proportion since the Realtors' group began tracking the figure in October 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steady hiring and near-record-low mortgage rates have helped increase sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the housing bubble burst more than six years ago, banks have imposed tighter credit conditions and required larger down payments. Those changes have left many would-be buyers unable to qualify for very low mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates dropped last week to near-record lows. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to 3.41 percent from 3.43 percent. That is not far from the record low of 3.31 percent last November.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A small but growing number of American corporations, operating in businesses as diverse as private prisons, billboards and casinos, are making an aggressive move to reduce -- or even eliminate -- their federal tax bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are declaring that they are not ordinary corporations at all. Instead, they say, they are something else: special trusts that are typically exempt from paying federal taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trust structure has been around for years but, until recently, it was generally used only by funds holding real estate. Now, the likes of the <span class="companylink">Corrections Corporation of America</span>, which owns and operates 44 prisons and detention centers across the nation, have quietly received permission from the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> to put on new corporate clothes and, as a result, save many millions on taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Corrections Corporation</span>, which is making the switch, expects to save $70 million in 2013. <span class="companylink">Penn National Gaming</span>, which operates 22 casinos, including <span class="companylink">the M Resort Spa Casino</span> in Las Vegas, recently won approval to change its tax designation, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changing from a standard corporation to a real estate investment trust, or REIT -- a designation signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower -- has suddenly become a hot corporate trend. One Wall Street analyst has characterized the label as a ''golden ticket'' for corporations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've been in this business for 30 years, and I've never seen the interest in REIT conversions as high as it is today,'' said Robert O'Brien, the head of the real estate practice at Deloitte &amp; Touche, the big accounting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when deficits and taxes loom large in Washington, some question whether the new real estate investment trusts deserve their privileged position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they were created in 1960, they were meant to be passive investment vehicles, like mutual funds, that buy up a broad portfolio of real estate -- whether shopping malls, warehouses, hospitals or even timberland -- and derive almost all of their income from those holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the bedrock principles -- and the reason for the tax exemption -- was that the trusts do not do any business other than owning real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But bit by bit, especially in recent years, that has changed as the I.R.S., in a number of low-profile decisions, has broadened the definition of real estate, and allowed companies to split off parts of their business that are unrelated to real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, prison companies like the <span class="companylink">Corrections Corporation</span> and the Geo Group successfully argued that the money they collect from governments for holding prisoners is essentially rent. Companies that operate cellphone towers have said that the towers themselves are real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conversions generally do not require the companies to change their underlying business. The chief executive of the Corrections Corporation, Damon T. Hininger, told investors in February that the new structure should help in the company's aim of ''housing more and more population for federal, state and local levels as they grow or deal with overcrowding.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The I.R.S. released its latest decision, allowing a data and document storage company to convert, on April 5. The letter did not include the name of the company, but several data storage companies, including Iron Mountain and Equinix, are in the process of converting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few days later, a strategist at the Wall Street firm Jefferies wrote in a report: ''It is not a far stretch to envision REITs concentrated in railroads, highways, mines, landfills, vineyards, farmland or any other 'immovable' structure that generates revenues.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, there are more than 1,000 real estate investment trusts, about 10 percent of them traded publicly on the stock market. Investors like them because, by law, they must distribute at least 90 percent of their taxable income to their shareholders -- a particularly alluring prospect today, given the low interest rates paid by many other basic investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benefits of converting are obvious for stockholders and corporate insiders as well. The conversion typically drives up a company's stock price. Investors are drawn by the prospect of lucrative dividends under the new structure. The mere rumor that a company might convert has been enough to send its stock price soaring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend has been a concern to advocates of the traditional trusts, who fear that the newcomers may eventually jeopardize the tax status of older funds that do not do any business other than owning real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I worry that in a world where Congress is very sensitive to taxes, that a lot of these structures could end up attracting a lot of attention that might not be entirely positive,'' said Ross L. Smotrich, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Rosenthal, a staff member at the Joint Committee on Taxation during the 1990s and now a visiting fellow at the nonpartisan <span class="companylink">Tax Policy Center</span>, said that the trend raises questions about the purpose of corporate income taxes at a time when there are so many ways around them. The conversions are one of many strategies that businesses use to avoid paying the corporate tax rate of 35 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What is there about a business owning real estate that suggests we should not tax them?'' Mr. Rosenthal said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Congressional staff members said they had noticed the recent conversions and were monitoring the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not the first wave of companies seeking out a new type of corporate status to avoid taxes. In the 1980s, dozens of companies, including Sahara Resorts and the <span class="companylink">Boston Celtics</span>, became master limited partnerships, another corporate form that is tax-exempt. After the practice attracted notice, Congress passed laws that limited the industries that could use the structure. In the 1990s, hotel companies took advantage of the laws, but a change to the laws in 1999 soon snuffed that out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is too soon to tell how far the current round of conversions will spread. <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span> recently counted 20 companies that are at some stage in the process of converting, and there has been a steady stream of suggestions for what industry might next secure I.R.S. approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawyers have also been finding creative ways to follow the letter of the law by splitting off parts of a company into subsidiaries that can be taxed. In the legal world, the most controversial such effort is being undertaken by Penn National, the casino company. It won approval from the I.R.S. late last year to turn itself into a real estate holding company. In the process, it created a tax-paying subsidiary that holds the casino operations and pays rent to the parent company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Brien, at Deloitte &amp; Touche, said he has been talking with other casino operators that are looking at making similar moves. The ruling could also open the door for restaurant companies like <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> and retailers like <span class="companylink">J. C. Penney</span> to follow a similar route, though neither company has indicated it is considering such a move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, companies like the <span class="companylink">Corrections Corporation</span> are quickly moving through the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The good news about this is that we are going to be able to enjoy a full year of tax savings for 2013,'' Mr. Hininger, the chief executive, said in February. Last week, the company's share price hit its highest level in over a decade.</p>

</div><div class="author">By JESSE EISINGER   </div><div>1007 words</div><div>19 April 2013</div><div>International Herald Tribune</div><div>INHT</div><div>16</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is the United States moving from the crash to the bubble, dispensing with that pesky economic recovery thing altogether?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve is well into its third round of quantitative easing, in which it uses newly created money to buy longer-term assets to bring down long-term lending rates. We are about five and a half years into the Fed’s extraordinary monetary policies (its out-of-the-box lending programs began before the crash, in late 2007).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effect the central bank hopes to produce has not materialized. Despite modest growth, the economy remains a wellspring of misery, with mass unemployment, wage stagnation and factories unused. In March, a smaller percentage of working-age people had jobs than at any time since 1979.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through its unconventional policies, the Fed is trying to ease the crisis. It has succeeded in driving down lending rates. The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and company would also like to kindle inflation expectations, prompting people to buy and companies to invest today instead of waiting until tomorrow. Supposedly, all of this will drive a self-sustaining recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the Fed has kindled speculation. Investors are desperate for yield and are paying up for riskier assets. In areas like real estate, structured finance and equities, the markets are ahead of the fundamentals. It does not look to me like a bubble yet. But I would call it the Dysplasia Stage — abnormal growth that looks precancerous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not just an economic or financial issue, it is cultural and psychological. Americans seem to have unlearned what real growth is and simply substituted speculative bubbles. Policy makers are either paralyzed or barrel forward because this is all they know how to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let’s first take the stock market. On the standard measures of looking at estimated earnings, the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span> 500-stock index is not particularly high. But that is misleading. Corporate earnings are extremely high as a percentage of the gross domestic product. Margins are high. Is that sustainable?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are more reliable measures of stock market value, and they look frothy. One gauge, the price of stocks based on the past decade of earnings, is named after the <span class="companylink">Yale University</span> economist Robert J. Shiller. Using that, stocks are too expensive by 65 percent. Alternatively, many investors look at something called the Q, devised by the economist James Tobin, which compares stock prices with corporate net worth. Nonfinancial companies are overpriced by 57 percent. The stock market is not at 1999 or 1929 levels, but it has reached peaks similar to those of 1906, 1936 and 1968, according to Smithers &amp; Co., a London-based research shop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make stocks correctly priced, ‘‘either earnings have to explode heavenward for 10 years or else stock prices have to come in a lot,’’ said Scott Frew, who runs Rockingham Capital Partners, a small hedge fund. He expects earnings to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not just stocks. Investors are bidding up junk bonds, commercial mortgage-backed securities and bundles of corporate loans called collateralized loan obligations. Last month, investors were paying more for such loans than at any time in the past five years. They are snapping up billions of dollars in securities made up of subprime auto loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the housing market is not just rising, but roaring back so fast you can feel the G-force coming off the reports. Home prices in Phoenix, Arizona, rose 23 percent over the past year, according to the latest <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span> Case-Shiller index. More than one in four homes in Phoenix were purchased by an investor who had bought more than five homes, up from 16 percent a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘I am now starting to become less skeptical’’ about the worries over a new housing bubble, said Christopher J. Mayer, a real estate economist at <span class="companylink">Columbia University</span> in New York. When local money is on the sidelines and outside buyers come in to snap up real estate, that typically ends badly, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what is going on?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed is engaged in ‘‘trickle-down monetary policy,’’ said Daniel Alpert, managing partner of <span class="companylink">Westwood Capital</span>, an investment bank. ‘‘This type of monetary policy is making the wealthy wealthier and hoping that it trickles down to the shop floor.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ‘‘trickle-down has never worked,’’ he said. ‘‘The wealthy don’t need to consume. And when there is oversupply of capacity, the wealthy don’t need to invest in new capacity.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Has the Federal Reserve monetary policy reached the average American? To a certain degree, yes. Many Americans have been able to refinance their homes. Those auto loans may be helping people get to and from work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the economic effects are modest, considering the size and scope of the effort. Investors glory in the asset inflation. The most pronounced effect of low mortgage rates has been to allow people with good credit and low debt to refinance multiple times over the past few years. Stock ownership is concentrated among the wealthy; junk bonds and collateralized loan obligations only more so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Alpert says the first round of quantitative easing was necessary to ease the liquidity problem in the markets — the unwillingness of investors to conquer their fears and buy up assets. But the third round is ‘‘unnecessary,’’ he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others disagree. Dean Baker, an economist from the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research who warned about the housing bubble much earlier than most, does not see a bubble yet. He advocates staying the course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Baker adds a note of caution, however. Regulators should move to high alert; Federal Reserve officials should start speaking out to signal that they are paying attention to the abnormalities. Eric S. Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, gave a speech recently that raised areas of concern, only to dismiss them as not overly worrisome yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least he was thinking about the issue.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4/16/13 | Updated to reflect new figures on housing starts and building permits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in the United States have been on a roller coaster ride for the last decade — soaring through 2005, then plunging in the steepest decline since the Great Depression. In 2012, though, prices began moving upward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How solid is the incipient housing recovery, and what are the prospects for home prices in the decade ahead?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some fresh clues about the short-term trends began arriving this week. And an analysis of the long-term prospects for home prices began appearing in a three-part series of columns in Sunday Business by Robert Shiller, the Yale economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the short-term trend: based, at least, on a report on Monday morning, it appeared to be taking a zigzag path rather than a straight line upward. According to the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market index, sentiment among home builders declined in April for the third consecutive month, to 42 from 44 the previous month. While that index climbed in 2012, it has not been above the neutral level of 50 since April 2006, when the market collapse was already under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report, on Tuesday — the tally of housing starts and building permits in March — Wall Street economists were expecting another set of strong numbers, but the picture was mixed. The Commerce Department said housing starts climbed to a 1.04 million annual rate, the fastest pace since June 2008, and up from a revised rate of 968,000 in February. But while construction surged for multifamily units — many intended as rentals — the building of single-family homes declined. And building permits over all fell 3.9 percent from the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the short-term trend for the housing market seemed clear and strong enough for Michael E. Feroli, chief United States economist at <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>, to conclude in a report on April 10 that residential investment – including home building, repairs, renovation and brokers’ fees – would rise enough this year to add 0.5 percent to G.D.P. growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for home prices, no major reports were imminent. But in the fourth quarter of 2012, the latest home period included in the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span> Case-Shiller 20-city index, prices rose sharply, at the fastest rate since June 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Shiller, who helped devise the Case-Shiller index, says in his Economic View column on Sunday even if the upward trend for prices continues for a while, historical data shows that it’s not necessarily meaningful over the long haul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“One-year home price increases, after correcting for inflation, have had almost no statistical relationship to increases 10 years down the road,” he writes. “Thus, the upturn last year is irrelevant to long-run forecasting. Booms are typically followed by busts, usually in far less than 10 years. In a decade, an entire housing boom, if there is one in inflation-corrected terms, is likely to have been reversed and completely washed away.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In assessing long-term price trends, he says, prospective home buyers ought to emphasize fundamental factors like inflation and construction costs, which he discusses in his first column. While inflation creates the illusion that real home prices are increasing, rising productivity in the construction industry often drives down the cost of housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next Sunday’s column will deal with real estate bubbles, and with the speculative effects of years of declining interest rates on housing and other markets. The third will consider cultural and demographic trends, including the stimulative market influence of a rising population — and the potential constraints on prices that could occur as America ages..</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT prices will today's home buyers get if they sell a decade from now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most people live in their home for many years. They don't need to view it as an investment at all, but if they do, they surely need a long forecasting horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that modern economics has a poor understanding of past movements in home prices. And that makes the task of predicting the state of the market in 2023 challenging, at the very least. Still, we can learn something by analyzing the factors that affect home prices in general.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been some good news lately: home prices have risen over the last year, and with those gains there has been a renewed sense of optimism. But do these price increases mean that homes are now good investments for the long haul?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, no. We do know one thing from economic research: one-year home price increases, after correcting for inflation, have had almost no statistical relationship to increases 10 years down the road. Thus, the upturn last year is irrelevant to long-run forecasting. Booms are typically followed by busts, usually in far less than 10 years. In a decade, an entire housing boom, if there is one in inflation-corrected terms, is likely to have been reversed and completely washed away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation has a major impact on long-term home prices. So do the costs of construction. We'll examine these factors now, and turn to other important influences like speculative pressures and cultural and demographic trends in subsequent columns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices look remarkably stable when corrected for inflation. Over the 100 years ending in 1990 -- before the recent housing boom -- real home prices rose only 0.2 percent a year, on average. The smallness of that increase seems best explained by rising productivity in construction, which offset increasing costs of land and labor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, home prices are likely to be much higher in 2023 when measured in nominal dollars -- those that aren't inflation-adjusted. Inflation is the deliberate policy of the Federal Reserve, with a target rate now of 2 percent a year as measured by the personal consumption expenditure deflator, or about 2.4 percent on the Consumer Price Index. At those rates, nominal prices will be roughly 25 percent higher, over all, in a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All else equal, the current Fed policy would have this effect: a home selling for $200,000 today will sell for around $250,000 in 2023, though the real price -- corrected for inflation -- would be unchanged. But because people often forget to correct for inflation, they may have the illusion that the market is improving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an ideal world, steady and uniform inflation would have no effect on rational decision-making because it affects incomes as well as prices. But in the real world, inflation does affect our psychology. People feel more optimistic when their nominal pay rises or when a neighbor's house sold for more than they paid for theirs. But in thinking about investments for the long term, we should focus on fundamentals -- on real, inflation-corrected values and on the economics behind them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is a harsh truth about homeownership: Over the long haul, it's hard for homes to compete with the stock market in real appreciation. That's because companies whose shares are traded on a stock exchange retain a good share of their earnings to plow back into the business. The business should grow and its real stock price should also grow through time -- unless the company makes poor decisions, as some certainly do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, real home prices should decline with time, except to the extent that households shell out some money and plow back some of their incomes into maintenance and improvements, because homes wear out and go out of style.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is an ambiguous investment to evaluate, because a good part of its real return typically comes in its providing a place to live, not in providing dividends paid in cash. For example, a homeowner may gradually realize that she doesn't need all of the space in her house, but may not be emotionally prepared to start recapturing some of its economic value. The owner may not want to take in roomers, to use the old phrase, just as a modern renter may not want to live in a room in someone else's home (though new markets like airbnb.com are aiming to change that mind-set).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the role of the construction industry, which is very good at building new homes and will crank out many more of them if prices rise relative to construction costs. It's logical that homes' ultimate values should be affected by home construction costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a 1956 study of home prices by the <span class="companylink">National Bureau of Economic Research</span>, Leo Grebler, David M. Blank and Louis Winnick documented a substantial decline in inflation-corrected construction costs per housing unit in the first few decades of the 20th century. They traced this decline to multiple causes, including a decline in the number of rooms per home, the use of gypsum wallboard in place of plaster and of asphalt shingles in place of slate, a shift in construction to lower-cost Southern climates and a relative increase in the number of multifamily housing units and apartment buildings. The authors concluded that the long-run movements in construction costs and home prices are ''remarkably similar.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was the prevailing theory of home prices at the time: construction costs drove the entire housing market. That view -- which implies that increasing productivity has restrained prices and could do so in the future -- is very different from the focus on financial pressures and speculative bubbles that drives much of our thinking now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steady progress in developing new construction equipment, materials and techniques can be seen in something as simple as the history of power drills. A big step forward came in 1889, with the invention of the electric drill. Then came a series of other inventions: the portable electric drill in 1895, the pistol-grip-and-trigger-switch portable electric drill in 1917 (by S. Duncan Black and Alonzo G. Decker), the Phillips head screw in 1935 (by Henry F. Phillips), the first cordless electric drill in 1961 and the first lithium ion battery, which improved cordless drills, in the 1970s. Each set in motion a string of other improvements that, over decades, penetrated the construction industry and vastly improved its productivity. We can expect more such inventions in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is hard to imagine the next advances in home construction technology, but there are some clues. For example, Behrokh Khoshnevis of the <span class="companylink">University of Southern California</span> is developing ''contour crafting'' robotics that he says will be able to accept computer instructions and, like gigantic 3-D printers, build houses. We cannot tell how well this will work, but computer technology has produced some amazing results.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT prices will today’s home buyers get if they sell a decade from now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most people live in their home for many years. They don’t need to view it as an investment at all, but if they do, they surely need a long forecasting horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that modern economics has a poor understanding of past movements in home prices. And that makes the task of predicting the state of the market in 2023 challenging, at the very least. Still, we can learn something by analyzing the factors that affect home prices in general.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been some good news lately: home prices have risen over the last year, and with those gains there has been a renewed sense of optimism. But do these price increases mean that homes are now good investments for the long haul?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, no. We do know one thing from economic research: one-year home price increases, after correcting for inflation, have had almost no statistical relationship to increases 10 years down the road. Thus, the upturn last year is irrelevant to long-run forecasting. Booms are typically followed by busts, usually in far less than 10 years. In a decade, an entire housing boom, if there is one in inflation-corrected terms, is likely to have been reversed and completely washed away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation has a major impact on long-term home prices. So do the costs of construction. We’ll examine these factors now, and turn to other important influences like speculative pressures and cultural and demographic trends in subsequent columns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices look remarkably stable when corrected for inflation. Over the 100 years ending in 1990 — before the recent housing boom — real home prices rose only 0.2 percent a year, on average. The smallness of that increase seems best explained by rising productivity in construction, which offset increasing costs of land and labor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, home prices are likely to be much higher in 2023 when measured in nominal dollars — those that aren’t inflation-adjusted. Inflation is the deliberate policy of the Federal Reserve, with a target rate now of 2 percent a year as measured by the personal consumption expenditure deflator, or about 2.4 percent on the Consumer Price Index[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/consumer_price_index/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. At those rates, nominal prices will be roughly 25 percent higher, over all, in a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All else equal, the current Fed policy would have this effect: a home selling for $200,000 today will sell for around $250,000 in 2023, though the real price — corrected for inflation — would be unchanged. But because people often forget to correct for inflation, they may have the illusion that the market is improving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an ideal world, steady and uniform inflation would have no effect on rational decision-making because it affects incomes as well as prices. But in the real world, inflation does affect our psychology. People feel more optimistic when their nominal pay rises or when a neighbor’s house sold for more than they paid for theirs. But in thinking about investments for the long term, we should focus on fundamentals — on real, inflation-corrected values and on the economics behind them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is a harsh truth about homeownership: Over the long haul, it’s hard for homes to compete with the stock market in real appreciation. That’s because companies whose shares are traded on a stock exchange retain a good share of their earnings to plow back into the business. The business should grow and its real stock price should also grow through time — unless the company makes poor decisions, as some certainly do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, real home prices should decline with time, except to the extent that households shell out some money and plow back some of their incomes into maintenance and improvements, because homes wear out and go out of style.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is an ambiguous investment to evaluate, because a good part of its real return typically comes in its providing a place to live, not in providing dividends paid in cash. For example, a homeowner may gradually realize that she doesn’t need all of the space in her house, but may not be emotionally prepared to start recapturing some of its economic value. The owner may not want to take in roomers, to use the old phrase, just as a modern renter may not want to live in a room in someone else’s home (though new markets like airbnb.com are aiming to change that mind-set).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the role of the construction industry, which is very good at building new homes and will crank out many more of them if prices rise relative to construction costs. It’s logical that homes’ ultimate values should be affected by home construction costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a 1956 study of home prices[http://papers.nber.org/books/greb56-1] by the <span class="companylink">National Bureau of Economic Research</span>, Leo Grebler, David M. Blank and Louis Winnick documented a substantial decline in inflation-corrected construction costs per housing unit in the first few decades of the 20th century. They traced this decline to multiple causes, including a decline in the number of rooms per home, the use of gypsum wallboard in place of plaster and of asphalt shingles in place of slate, a shift in construction to lower-cost Southern climates and a relative increase in the number of multifamily housing units and apartment buildings. The authors concluded that the long-run movements in construction costs and home prices are “remarkably similar.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was the prevailing theory of home prices at the time: construction costs drove the entire housing market. That view — which implies that increasing productivity has restrained prices and could do so in the future — is very different from the focus on financial pressures and speculative bubbles that drives much of our thinking now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steady progress in developing new construction equipment, materials and techniques can be seen in something as simple as the history of power drills. A big step forward came in 1889, with the invention of the electric drill. Then came a series of other inventions: the portable electric drill in 1895, the pistol-grip-and-trigger-switch portable electric drill in 1917 (by S. Duncan Black and Alonzo G. Decker), the Phillips head screw in 1935 (by Henry F. Phillips), the first cordless electric drill in 1961 and the first lithium ion battery, which improved cordless drills, in the 1970s. Each set in motion a string of other improvements that, over decades, penetrated the construction industry and vastly improved its productivity. We can expect more such inventions in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is hard to imagine the next advances in home construction technology, but there are some clues. For example, Behrokh Khoshnevis of the <span class="companylink">University of Southern California</span> is developing “contour crafting” robotics[http://contourcrafting.org/] that he says will be able to accept computer instructions and, like gigantic 3-D printers, build houses. We cannot tell how well this will work, but computer technology has produced some amazing results. Why is it that we worry about the effect of information technology on our jobs but usually don’t link such uncertainty to the outlook for home prices?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technical advances affect other industries, too, of course, and the performance of housing as an investment relative to others depends ultimately on the comparative rates of progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THESE variables alone suggest how tricky it is to forecast your home’s value when the time comes to sell. Prices can go down as well as up. That is also true for investments in general, of course, and is why generations of portfolio analysts have advocated assessment of risks, and not just extrapolation of recent trends, as the key to intelligent investing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- As government agencies are forced to do more with less, the <span class="companylink">General Services Administration</span> has stepped up its efforts to dispose of surplus government buildings across the country in new and more profitable ways, instead of simply auctioning them off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an effort to streamline operations, the G.S.A., the federal government's landlord, has sold hundreds of buildings since 2010. But in the last several months it has been working with private developers to negotiate land swaps that reduce the government's real estate portfolio while consolidating offices and saving money for taxpayers. The goal, the agency's acting administrator, Dan M. Tangherlini, wrote in a staff memorandum, is ''to maximize the value of our real estate assets and reduce our federal footprint.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government owns about 14,000 excess buildings and other structures, and the G.S.A. is working to dispose of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strategy is evident here, where a proposed land swap involving the 40-year-old F.B.I. building last month yielded 35 formal expressions of interest, and in Miami and Los Angeles, where plans are under way to replace and dispose of two old federal courthouses. ''What we've seen is more attention and focus put on this activity, in part because of fiscal constraints across the government,'' Mr. Tangherlini said. ''At G.S.A., we are asking ourselves if there are other ways to speed the process of disposal and get positive outcomes as a result.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dorothy Robyn, the Public Buildings Service commissioner for the G.S.A., said at a public meeting on the F.B.I. building in January that ''functionally,'' much of the government's property, with an average age of 47 years, is ''out of date.'' But despite government efforts to sell obsolete or surplus properties quickly, the process has sometimes bogged down in political, technical and economic issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal courthouses in Miami and Los Angeles were long overdue for replacement, but how to do it cheaply and efficiently and what to do with the old structures have presented challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disposing of the David W. Dyer Federal Building and United States Courthouse in Miami has proved to be far more complicated than expected. Built in 1933 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, the 170,000-square-foot Mediterranean Revival structure was vacated in 2008 when a new court building was completed. The G.S.A.'s initial plan to renovate the older courthouse for continued use as a federal building was scrapped because of the $60 million cost. When the G.S.A. sought expressions of interest in the building last August, only two responses came in, neither acceptable to the agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the proposals came from <span class="companylink">Miami Dade College</span>, which wanted to convert the old four-story courthouse, across the street from the college, into an educational and cultural center. But the courthouse is connected to another courthouse, and they share a courtyard. Separating the utilities and dividing secure areas from nonsecure ones in the buildings could cost nearly $15 million, which the G.S.A. said it would not pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't see we have any budget for that,'' said Juan C. Mendieta, a spokesman for Miami Dade College. ''We have a pretty challenging budgetary situation here in Florida.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a House subcommittee hearing in Miami in March, John E. B. Smith, the Public Buildings Services commissioner for the Southeast Sunbelt Region, testified that ''the Dyer courthouse helps highlight the challenges of developing long-term asset strategies in changing fiscal times, and the unique characteristics of properties that can present hurdles to repositioning.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The swapping strategy being applied to the F.B.I. building, where a developer will get the old headquarters in return for building replacement headquarters elsewhere in the region, is now also being tested in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, federal judges, citing security concerns, have been pushing for a new building to replace the late 1930s courthouse on North Spring Street. In December, the G.S.A. awarded a $318 million contract to Clark Construction, of Bethesda, Md., to build a 550,000-square foot courthouse at another city location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the G.S.A. solicited ''creative development ideas'' for the old courthouse, which it said it hoped a developer would acquire in exchange for building federal offices in Los Angeles for other agencies. The G.S.A.'s ''request for information'' elicited four responses by the Feb. 11 deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Really, all I need is one or two good ones to get a sense of what the market's interested in,'' Mr. Tangherlini said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before a federal property can be offered for sale, several hurdles must be cleared. One major constraint is a requirement that federal, state and local government agencies must first be given the opportunity to acquire it. Then, under the 1987 McKinney-Vento Act, the property must also be made available to shelter the homeless. In addition, federal environmental and historic preservation reviews are required. Only then can properties be sold to private entities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To simplify things, the Obama administration proposed streamlining legislation in 2011 to create a civilian board modeled after the military's Base Realignment and Closure Commission. A Republican version of the bill passed the House last year, but the Senate has yet to act. ''Both houses of Congress and the administration are agreeing in principle,'' Mr. Tangherlini said. ''It seems to be that's at least the three key ingredients you need to get anything done in this town.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ron Kendall, a real estate consultant and a former chief asset officer at G.S.A., said: ''This is a perennial stalking horse for many administrations. Everyone comes in with high hopes there's gold in them there hills, unbelievable stashes of federal property bureaucrats are just sitting on.'' However, he added, the agency's Public Buildings Service ''has done a lot to right its ship.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2010, the G.S.A. has sold 352 properties, including 114 in 2012, totaling $37.5 million in sales last year alone. Properties sold at auction included a federal building in Moscow, Idaho, for $2.4 million, and the Charleston Naval Hospital, in South Carolina, for $2 million. The city of North Charleston, which bought the hospital, soon sold it to a private developer for $9.2 million, after packaging it with more land and an old shopping center it owned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But straight auctioning of properties is not always a fast track to disposal. The 1940s Art Deco-style West Heating Plant, in the Georgetown section of Washington, sat unused for more than a decade before being sold in February for $19.5 million. The Levy Group and <span class="companylink">Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts</span>, who made the successful bid among five offers, plan a $100 million renovation of the six-story, 93,078-square foot building, which they intend to convert into 70 to 80 condominium units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Levy, president of the Levy Group, a commercial real estate development firm based here, said he first considered the property 13 years ago and renewed his interest in 2010, when <span class="companylink">Four Seasons</span>, based in Toronto, also expressed interest. Despite what he described as a ''cumbersome process,'' he said he and his partners were determined. ''G.S.A. is required to jump through hoops,'' he said. ''They're not poised for a quick turnaround.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tangherlini said that, even with the auction route: ''It's not as simple as pointing to an empty building and saying 'We're not using it anymore; let's just sell it.' And we have to make sure we're not just putting up 'for sale' signs left and right.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This might be a good time to take a look at the most important environmental law that nobody has ever heard of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate industry fought that law bitterly in Congress, but lost, and it landed on Ronald Reagan's desk in 1982. The president not only signed it, but did so with a rhetorical flourish, calling it a ''triumph for natural resource conservation and federal fiscal responsibility.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law -- the Coastal Barrier Resources Act -- was intended to protect much of the American coastline, and it did so in a clever way that drew votes from the most conservative Republicans and the most liberal Democrats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is worth bringing up today because we are once again in an era when our coasts are at risk and our national coffers are strained. The $75 billion in damages from Hurricane Sandy, coming only seven years after the $80 billion from Hurricane Katrina, told us this much: We need a plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The climate is changing, the ocean is rising, more storms are coming, and millions of Americans are in harm's way. The costs of making people whole after these storms are soaring. Without ideas that stand some chance of breaking the political gridlock in Washington, the situation will eventually become a national crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law that Reagan signed in 1982 might just offer a model of how to move forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the background:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists are still figuring out how storms will be altered as global warming proceeds, but they are pretty certain about some things. Land ice the world over is melting in the changing climate, and the ocean is heating up, too, which makes the water expand. Those factors are causing the ocean to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It rose about eight inches in the past century, requiring billions of dollars to fight erosion. Recently the rate of increase seems to have jumped, to about a foot per century -- and climate scientists think it will go up quite a bit more. The cautious prediction at this point is that we could see two or three feet of sea-level rise by 2100, and possibly even six feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What will that mean for people living near the shore?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might think things would be fine for them until the day the ocean finally covers their land. But it does not work that way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long before inundation occurs, people will be hit more and more often by coastal flooding. In places where it took a huge storm to send seawater into living rooms, a routine storm will do the trick once the ocean has risen several feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should be obvious that the more people we move out of harm's way in the reasonably near future, the better off we will ultimately be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we are doing the opposite, offering huge subsidies for coastal development. We proffer federally backed flood insurance at rates bearing no resemblance to the risks. Even more important, we go in after storms and write big checks so towns can put the roads, sewers and beach sand right back where they were.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are, in other words, using the federal Treasury to shield people from the true risks that they are taking by building on the coasts. Coastal development has soared as a direct consequence, and this rush toward the sea is the biggest factor in the rising costs of storm bailouts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what was so clever about that 1982 law, and how can we learn from it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development pressure on the nation's coasts was intense back then, but hundreds of miles of barrier islands and beaches were as yet unspoiled. Environmental groups would have loved a national ban on further coastal development, but conservatives would never have gone along with that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two Republicans, Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island and Representative Thomas B. Evans Jr. of Delaware, found the magic formula. Their bill simply declared that on sensitive coastlines that were then undeveloped, any future development would have to occur without federal subsidies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, no flood insurance and no fat checks after storms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law did not prohibit anybody from building anything. And in fact, some development has occurred on lands in the redlined zone. But the law has mostly held, discouraging development along some 1.3 million acres of American coastline -- a monumental triumph that continues to pay dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So here is a modest idea. As the first plank of our plan for coping with storm risk, what about expanding the boundaries of the program that Reagan took such pride in?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is not to be cruel: people deserve humanitarian help after big storms. But Robert S. Young, head of the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at <span class="companylink">Western Carolina University</span>, thinks we have to start weaning beach towns from the welfare roll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way to begin, he suggests, would be to identify the towns in the riskiest areas, the ones that the taxpayers keep bailing out again and again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps we say to them: You get one more shot. We will make you whole after the next big storm, and if you choose to use the money to rebuild, then you are on your own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just maybe, in some areas that should never have been developed in the first place, the necessary retreat from the beaches would finally begin.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While browsing through real estate agencies in New York City, a little déjà vu can be unavoidable. There's a <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span> over here, a Century 21 over there, a <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> up ahead -- and why look, there's another Corcoran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But before national chains and sprawling franchises gobbled up so many peddlers of leases and deeds, there was real variety to be found, not only among companies, but also within them, because some local real estate agencies were outfitted with multiple hats. Apartment rentals and sales might share billing on a single storefront with a notary public, an insurance broker, a travel agent or all of the above. And perhaps the most enduring of these old-fashioned partnerships was a real estate agency that was also a place where you could do your income taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How long will this take?'' Joseph Bove said when asked about his work processing taxes for his family's business, <span class="companylink">Bove Real Estate</span>. ''I'm in the middle of tax season.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As real estate has become more competitive in recent decades and the business increasingly specialized, many of these little partnerships have dried up. In some areas outside Manhattan, however, especially where real estate prices are less astronomical, these cross-pollinated agencies are not entirely gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I try to supplement my income with a little bit here, a little bit there,'' said Joseph Fabrizio, owner of Top Realty Company in Ridgewood, Queens, a company founded by his father in the 1960s. ''I became the tax preparer and the real estate broker. And I'm also a funeral director.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who offer both a real estate agency and tax preparation services say that the combination increases foot traffic, and that clients can be easily shared and referred back and forth between the businesses without either side being robbed of their lunch. Sometimes, the arrangement is a matter of two businesses splitting the office and the rent, and in other instances, one person, or one family, is behind every door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ula's Real Estate,'' reads one of the many signs hanging from a storefront at Greenpoint Avenue and Leonard Street in Brooklyn. The same sign concludes, with the perplexing non sequitur, ''Income tax.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a husband-and-wife team, where he sells insurance and does taxes, and she, along with their daughter, does real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a synergy between the businesses,'' Alexander Doukhowetzky, the husband portion of the team, said last week as he sat in his office, a narrow room stuffed with clients, manila folders and a small brindle dog named Cobra, who was merrily shredding a stuffed animal. His wife, Ursula Doukhowetzky, opened the real estate portion of the business first, he said, and they added the accounting services soon after.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My wife is an extrovert and I'm an introvert,'' said Mr. Doukhowetzky, who speaks Russian, Polish, English and Farsi, a natural fit for a long-Polish and Eastern European neighborhood, aside from the Farsi. ''So real estate suits her, and more technical stuff suits me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About five years ago, 22 years into the life of their business, they set up a second office a few blocks away where the real estate business is now based, but they still cross-pollinate with referral business and signs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, the practice of families' splitting various duties behind a single sign stretches back decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's how it was since 1946 when my father and uncle started it,'' Mr. Bove said of <span class="companylink">Bove Real Estate</span>. Today, his son, Alphonse, handles the real estate, and father and son do the taxes. The elder Mr. Bove's wife, Michelle, runs a travel agency, Bove Travel, right upstairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at <span class="companylink">New York University</span>, said that the practice of local real estate agencies' doing double or triple duty had been hammered in recent years. Specialized national and international chains have swallowed large areas of the real estate market. Companies like <span class="companylink">H&amp;R Block</span> and programs like TurboTax have sucked away much of basic tax preparation. And even the business of notaries public has largely moved to the inside of banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These businesses, he said in an e-mail, are ''increasingly a relic of specialization and globalization.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So much so, it turns out, that real estate professionals at some major New York City firms, and even the National Association of Realtors, have never heard of such hybridized agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aroza Sanjana, president of Warren Lewis Sotheby's International Realty, said that while she was aware of these companies -- she used one to do her taxes years ago, she said -- she did not consider including their extra services when she took over the Warren Lewis brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It dilutes our brand to have any other businesses,'' Ms. Sanjana said. ''In this market, as competitive as it is, and with as many people in real estate as there are, you can't afford to give less to that one task. We need all hands on one deck.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, Gus Perry, principal broker of <span class="companylink">Stein-Perry Real Estate</span> in Washington Heights, which was recently acquired by Halstead Property, said he saw the virtues of the arrangement, having rented out office space to two tax preparers over the years. Nonetheless, that is about to come to an end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now, with this new Halstead merger, we need the space,'' Mr. Perry said. ''We're looking to grow.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so his tenant of three years, Ira Stein (no relation to the Stein of Mr. Perry's firm), will have to start a new search for a slice of uptown office space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If someone is selling bagels, you don't want to be in there doing tax returns,'' Mr. Stein said. ''I was looking for something semiprofessional and real estate caught my eye,'' he continued. ''I would have liked to stay here a little longer.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A little pocket of Los Angeles County tucked into the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains reflects a crucial facet of suburban life. There's tiny, wealthy Bradbury, a town that prides itself on having one of the richest ZIP codes in Los Angeles, where a house is on the market for $68.8 million. A couple of miles to the east is Azusa. This modest suburb is more than two-thirds Latino, a town of working families whose incomes and home values are a sliver of the wealth nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These towns represent extremes of social inequality, but in Los Angeles and other areas, they reflect a defining pattern of contemporary suburban life. Nationwide, rich and poor neighborhoods like these house a growing proportion of Americans, up to 31 percent compared with 15 percent in 1970, according to a recent study by Sean F. Reardon and Kendra Bischoff. Meanwhile, iconic middle-income suburbs are shrinking in numbers and prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's suburbs provide a map not just to the different worlds of the rich and the poor, which have always been with us, but to the increase in inequality between economic and social classes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the historian's perspective, these patterns also reveal another truth about suburban places: their tendency to sustain and reinforce inequality. Bradbury and Azusa have maintained their spots in the top and bottom tiers of the Los Angeles suburbs for decades. The sociologist John Logan described this ''stratifying'' feature long ago, noting that localities held on to social advantages and disadvantages over time. Patterns are established, and successive waves of pressure -- fiscal, political, social -- tend to keep things moving in the same direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of this is obvious. High property values support high-achieving schools, which in turn increase property values and personal wealth. Racial redlining holds property values down, limiting investment in schools and preventing families from building equity, disadvantages that pass to the next generation like a negative inheritance. The point is not simply that rich and poor people live in different places through a kind of class sorting in the marketplace. The places themselves help to create wealth and poverty. Because of this power of places to fix inequity over time, current patterns are likely to outlive their residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Angeles embodies these processes in vivid ways, showing how recent trends have amplified uneven landscapes from the past. At the high end, San Marino, Palos Verdes Estates and La Cañada Flintridge have ranked for decades among the county's top municipalities. All are picturesque suburbs, sited in some of the most visually appealing locales in the Southland. Adding to these natural advantages, each is carefully controlled by land-use restrictions that freeze in place their landscapes of high-end homes and freeze out almost everyone else. In San Marino, these buffers are so strong that home prices actually rose during the recession. At the other end, working-class towns like Azusa, San Fernando and Maywood began and remain in a lower tier. These suburbs started modestly with small homes and slender public investments, and they passed these humble trappings down through time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Globalization helps drive these patterns to new extremes. Money flows into suburbs like San Marino and Palos Verdes, where Asian immigrants buy up expensive properties and generously donate their time and money to the local schools. Money flows out of poorer suburbs like South Gate, Bell and Huntington Park, all heavily Latino, where disposable income is tight and many families export remittances to a home country. New poverty builds upon old impoverishment. Infrastructure is stretched as renters crowd into dwellings that were modest to begin with. The toxic footprint of departed industries is left behind for new residents to contend with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of Los Angeles's middling suburbs have also slipped, especially those ravaged by plant closures since the 1980s. The southern section of blue-collar suburbs was hit especially hard. Here, suburbia transformed from comfortable communities housing unionized workers with well-paying jobs in local factories that gave them access to a middle-class lifestyle to fiscally strained communities housing immigrants working in low-paying, nonunion jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outer suburbs have fared little better. As home costs skyrocketed in recent decades, families chased ''affordable'' housing to the exurbs. They took on outsize mortgages and monster commutes, and they took with them congested roads, smog and sprawl. Compounding these strains, tax revenues lagged behind the cost of schools, roads, parks and libraries -- the very infrastructure necessary to sustain middle-class life. This edifice came crashing down in the recession. In the Inland Empire, 60 miles east of Los Angeles, one in six homes entered foreclosure between 2006 and 2009. Billboards on the interstate recite a sad litany of child custody law, foreclosure counseling and addiction hot lines -- symbols of the good life turned inside out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policies to redress suburban inequality must focus not only on factors like income but also on tax equity across metro areas and regional planning that fairly distributes resources and responsibilities (like affordable housing). We should limit the mortgage-interest deduction for second homes and for values above the regional median. These steps would reduce distortions that inflate housing prices and concentrate wealth in what are already wealthy places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not enough to call for measures that stop suburbanization -- the suburbs aren't going anywhere. If all we do is try to pretend away their radically unequal fortunes, we will just drop a new suburban inequality on top of the old one.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEATTLE -- When an office building here that bills itself as the world's greenest officially opens later this month, it will present itself as a ''living building zoo,'' with docents leading tours and smartphone-wielding tourists able to scan bar codes to learn about the artfully exposed mechanical and electrical systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenants have already begun moving into the six-story Bullitt Center, in advance of its grand opening on Earth Day, April 22. With the final touches nearly complete on the 50,000-square-foot office building at 1501 East Madison Street, at the edge of the city's Capitol Hill neighborhood, its occupants are about to embark upon an unparalleled -- and very public -- experiment in sustainability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once settled in, they will be guinea pigs in a $30 million living laboratory distinguished by its composting toilets, strict energy and water budgets and a conspicuous lack of on-site parking. To earn its environmental bragging rights, the Bullitt Center must complete a rigorous one-year certification process called the Living Building Challenge, which requires both water and energy self-sufficiency, among a list of 20 demands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Provided that the building clears a few remaining regulatory hurdles, all its water will be supplied by rainwater collected in a 56,000-gallon cistern before being filtered and disinfected. A rooftop array of photovoltaic panels, extending beyond the building like the brim of a graduation mortarboard, will produce an estimated 230,000 kilowatt-hours a year, hopefully just enough to break even for a building that is 83 percent more efficient than the city's typical commercial site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project's backers, led by the environmentally minded <span class="companylink">Bullitt Foundation</span>, hope to demonstrate that a carbon-neutral office space can be commercially viable and aesthetically stunning without saddling its occupants with onerous demands. And they are determined to make their strategy and performance so transparent that it can be easily copied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of tucking the mechanical and electrical rooms out of sight, for example, large plate glass windows will showcase the engineering, while quick response codes tag points of interest so tourists can use their smartphones to learn about individual elements, according to Chris Rogers, the chief executive and partner of the developer, Point32.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A kiosk in a double-height exhibition space will also let visitors access real-time measurements like the building's indoor air quality, energy consumption, photovoltaic power production and water levels. The Bullitt Center, in fact, will be one of the planet's most closely monitored commercial buildings, allowing managers to single out energy hogs down to the level of individual plugs, said Robert B. Peña, an associate professor of architecture in the Integrated Design Lab at the <span class="companylink">University of Washington</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the building is still the highest-performing one of its kind 10 years from now, said Denis Hayes, president and chief executive of the Bullitt Foundation, the experiment will have failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Living Building Challenge's imperatives go far beyond those of the better-known LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification. Its yearlong vetting process is designed in part to avoid the embarrassment suffered by some LEED certified buildings, where seemingly efficient buildings have proven to be much less so after the buildings have been completed and undergone energy audits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a number of states, counties and municipalities provide tax credits and fee reductions for LEED structures, only a few municipalities have followed suit so far for the newer Living Building Challenge. Nevertheless, proponents say that avoiding energy and water utility bills for 250 years, the expected life span of the Bullitt Center, offers its own compelling financial incentives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Living Building Challenge has 143 registered projects in 10 countries. Its process is so demanding, however, that only three buildings in the United States have been fully certified so far; the largest of those is an eighth the size of the Bullitt Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So much potential energy savings has already been wrung out of the building in its construction that nearly half of the expected electricity use will depend on what's plugged into the outlets. Every tenant will be expected to abide by strict annual usage budgets or pay for overages, but extra-fine electrical circuits and detailed outlet metering can help diagnose problem spots down to, say, a malfunctioning printer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hayes is keenly aware that the building's success depends upon its attractiveness to tenants, and his development team is promoting several distinctive features, including the fact that it may be the first heavy-timber midrise building erected in Seattle since the 1920s. The timber and steel frame uses native Douglas fir certified by the <span class="companylink">Forest Stewardship Council</span>. The exposed wood ceilings on the 13-foot-high upper floors also contribute to an airy loftlike feel, with exposed steel cross braces and 10-foot-high windows that maximize daylight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another signature feature, a glass-enclosed stairwell that Mr. Hayes has named the ''irresistible stairway,'' rewards climbers with panoramic views of downtown and Puget Sound. The behavioral carrot, aimed at promoting both health and energy conservation, has been juxtaposed with the stick of a slow and less conveniently sited elevator that requires key card access. With advertised lease rates of $28 to $30 a square foot, the building is in line with comparable properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It helps that a group of enthusiastic early adopters has already leased more than two-thirds of the available office space. That group includes several organizations and companies heavily invested in the project's success: PAE Consulting Engineers, the building's lead engineering firm; the developer Point32, which will manage a 40-desk co-working space; the Integrated Design Lab, which played a major consulting role and will have both office space and a 40-seat classroom; and the International Living Future Institute, which since 2006 has run the Living Building Challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pioneering spirit resonates strongly with other tenants-to-be like Michele Gomes, co-owner and chief creative officer of Interchange Media Art Productions, a video and television production company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gomes and her business partner are leasing two desks on the fourth floor co-working space, a ''huge move up'' from her company's current office in a windowless and perpetually cold basement, she said. Even more important, Ms. Gomes is eager to work among peers who have similar sustainability values. ''To have like-minded people sharing the same space, to me that's going to be extremely inspiring,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Intentional Futures, a technology and software-focused design and engineering studio founded by former <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> executives, has leased the 7,900-square-foot fifth floor. Ian Sands, a co-founder and managing partner, said the 20-employee company had outgrown its office directly beneath a local broadcaster's helipad and was looking to tap into the creative energy emanating from the city's bustling Pike-Pine Corridor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Mr. Sands admires the decision to forgo a traditional garage, he said the lack of on-site parking, coupled with Seattle's inadequate mass transit, could create commuting headaches for employees who live in the city's eastern suburbs and who may ''have to figure out other methods or places to park nearby because they will have to drive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hayes said the decision to not have on-site parking generated ''spirited conversation'' during the design phase. Instead, a space about the size of a three-car garage will be reserved exclusively for bicycles, while commuting bicyclists can wash away the morning sweat in one of the rainwater-fed showers on each floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Whitney, the <span class="companylink">Bullitt Foundation</span>'s program officer, said he had adapted to his new work space by buying a second bike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a partly cloudy afternoon in early March, Mr. Whitney, Mr. Hayes, and three other <span class="companylink">Bullitt Foundation</span> employees gathered in a glass-walled conference room in their sixth floor office to offer some admittedly biased first impressions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than a week after moving from a nearly windowless brick carriage house, the employees were still amazed by the spectacular views, ample natural light and almost distracting quiet. The composting toilets, though, remained a source of curiosity even for them, and early discussions have centered on the pulse of foam that cascades down the inner rim of each funnel-shaped bowl to expedite its delivery to the waiting composters below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two weeks later, Mr. Peña led a tour group of corporate real estate professionals through the bowels of the Bullitt Center to check out the business end of the 24 toilets. Two rows of five bright blue aerobic composters, each the ''size of a Fiat 500,'' he figured, were busily doing their thing -- so efficiently that the first compost extraction would not be required for another 18 months, when the resulting mulch will be commingled with other compost from King County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But do they smell? Mr. Peña invited his tour group of 20 to inspect the boxy composters up close and determine for themselves: they did not. The aerobic process is odorless, provided that the building's maintenance workers ensure proper ventilation and regular mixing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, Mr. Peña hoped the building's novelties would become invisible as the occupants adjusted. ''As much as I like to think of this building as a living laboratory, I think for the commercial tenants in this building, we also want it to be just as normal as possible,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With inventory at near-record lows and prices inching up, all signs are pointing toward a seller's market for Manhattan real estate this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of apartments for sale dropped 34.4 percent to 4,960 listings in the first three months of the year -- the largest year-over-year decline in 12 years, according to a report by the <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> brokerage firm. At the same time, the number of sales went up 6.3 percent to 2,457 and prices increased across all categories, with the median sales price at $820,555, up 5.9 percent, according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the exception of the second and third quarter of 2010, when prices were buoyed by the homeowners' tax credit, ''that is the largest year-over-year increase since Lehman fell'' in 2008, said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and the author of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>'s report. ''If you choke supply by the throat,'' he added, the inevitable outcome is that ''prices rise.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this means a tough time for those looking to buy. ''The demand is across the board from studios to $50 million apartments, and there is not enough supply,'' said Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, which reported the median price was stable for the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2012. ''There are more bidding wars. There's more frustration.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the average price was down 10 percent, Corcoran attributed that dip to a shift in market share toward smaller apartments and resale co-ops as more entry-level buyers, enticed by low mortgage rates, decided to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports by Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property, however, showed the median price down by 5 percent to $780,000 in the first quarter of 2013 compared with the same period the previous year, a decrease that the firms consider an aberration caused by a rush of high-end closings at the end of 2012 in anticipation of changes to tax laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All these deals that normally would have closed in January, February and March were pushed forward,'' said Hall F. Willkie, president of Brown Harris Stevens Residential. ''As a firm, our closings were three times what our high had ever been in the month of December,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average prices skewed lower as well, down 16 percent to $1,252,081, in part because last year's average was inflated by an $88 million closing at 15 Central Park West. Looking ahead, Mr. Willkie noted, ''Our new deals are considerably above where they were in the first quarter of last year, which was our record year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, there were 3,066 new contracts signed in the first quarter, up 15 percent compared with the first three months of 2012, according to StreetEasy.com. The Web site's analysis also showed prices going up 26.8 percent in the first quarter compared with last year, and a 41.3 percent drop in price cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong demand for new apartments means many new developments are selling inventory based on floor plans, before the buildings are completed. The sales center at 56 Leonard Street, a new luxury tower in TriBeCa, opened in February, and half the building is already sold, with more than $450 million in signed contracts. The median price of new development units also jumped 37 percent to $1.3 million in the first quarter from the same period last year, according to Corcoran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And with construction costs high, new development is meant to attract luxury buyers, offering little relief to the rest of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers expect supply to begin to loosen up as prices rise, because homeowners with little or negative equity who have been holding back may finally put their homes up for sale as prices appreciate. ''People are looking to move on with their life,'' said Diane M. Ramirez, president of Halstead Property. ''I think we'll see more resale product come on in a more normal way.'' She added, ''I'm optimistic the balance will not get too much worse.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But buyers who wait could face higher prices as mortgage rates and prices are expected to rise. ''You might have more inventory to look at next year, but financing costs might be higher and home prices will certainly be higher than right now,'' said Stan Humphries, the chief economist of Zillow.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While all of this means sellers currently have the upper hand, brokers caution against raising prices too quickly. ''We hope that we don't see crazy price increases,'' said Dottie Herman, the chief executive of Douglas Elliman. ''You want them to rise in a smart way and not just based on a shortage of inventory,'' she continued. ''You want them to rise in a fashion that doesn't create a bubble.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tens of thousands of co-op and condominium owners across New York City are facing a tax increase this year after the recent tweak of tax-abatement regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Jan. 30, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed into law a bill passed by the New York State Legislature amending a property tax break for residential co-ops and condos. These buildings have relied on the abatement for over 15 years to help offset a disparity in the tax burden between their units and single-, two- and three-family homes. Before the law changed, the abatement was at least 17.5 percent and applied to nearly all owners in qualified properties. The new legislation allows owners to claim the tax break only on a primary residence. Pieds-à-terre, or units held solely in a trust or by a limited-liability company, no longer qualify.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Letters were sent out in February by the Department of Finance to some 120,000 of the city's 360,000 co-op and condo owners notifying them that they no longer qualify for the tax break if it was determined, based on city records, that their apartments were not being used as primary residences, or if there wasn't enough information available to make such a determination. Those owners have until April 12 to respond to the letter and prove that the apartment is their primary residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These changes mean that some apartment owners could soon face a higher tax bill, but they could also upend a longstanding method used by co-op boards to replenish their coffers. The abatement was paid in a lump sum directly to the building, and was then distributed, at least on paper, to unit owners. But most boards also traditionally issued an assessment to owners for about the same amount as the tax break and used that money to subsidize the operation of the building, said Eva C. Talel, a partner of <span class="companylink">Stroock &amp; Stroock &amp; Lavan</span>. ''It was a relatively painless way to raise money for the building,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the exception of sponsors and investors, who never qualified for the abatement and had to reach into their pockets to pay for the assessment outright, the accounting procedure effectively created a wash for most co-op owners. ''This new law has changed that calculus,'' said Ms. Talel, noting that in some buildings a majority of owners will no longer qualify for the abatement, and therefore the lump sum paid to buildings could be much smaller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further complicating matters is the fact that the new regulation, which was held up in Albany last year and replaces a law that expired in June, applies retroactively from the start of the fiscal property tax year, which began July 1, 2012. Many buildings have already paid part of their bill based on the old law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-op boards now have to decide whether they will bill owners directly to make up the difference or tap into another building fund, if available, to fill the gap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's an administrative mess,'' said Ben Kirschenbaum, the general counsel of Cooper Square Realty, which manages about 450 buildings, including more than 250 co-ops and condos, ''and it's going to be distressing and upsetting to at least some shareholders.'' For now, many buildings are holding off on decisions to see the final list of who in their building qualifies and who does not. But the bottom line, as Mr. Kirschenbaum added, is that ''many co-ops will have a much bigger cash need come July 1.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The co-op tax abatement was created in 1996 as a first step toward eliminating a significant disparity in taxation between co-op and condo apartments, which are generally assessed and taxed at 45 percent of market value, and single, two- and three-family homes, which are assessed at 6 percent a year. The abatement has periodically expired and been renewed without much change, until now. Eliminating the benefit for units used as a second home, held solely in trust or held in an LLC, reintroduces the taxation disparity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you own a one- to three-family house in Brooklyn and Queens, it doesn't have to be a primary residence'' to get the lower tax rate, said Stuart M. Saft, a Manhattan lawyer and the chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums. He noted that some people put their apartments in trusts as part of their estate planning, or under a limited-liability company for privacy concerns. Although the apartment is technically owned by the trust or the LLC, the people behind the trust or the LLC are the primary residents, live there full time and pay New York property taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No one should be discriminated against because they place the ownership of their unit into a trust,'' said Steven Spinola, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York. ''If they or their beneficiaries are the occupants, then they should be entitled to the rebate. The same is true for those that own their units through an LLC.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David M. Frankel, the commissioner of the <span class="companylink">New York City Department of Finance</span>, said in an e-mail that ''there is no provision in the new co-op/condo abatement law'' that would apply to beneficiaries of trusts or LLCs. ''We are aware of the concerns regarding eligibility and will review what options are available for beneficial owners of trusts,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether co-op boards will test the ruling in court remains to be seen, though some co-op specialists have alluded to it. ''This latest step is so outlandish it would be absurd for it not to be challenged,'' Mr. Saft said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, here is a breakdown of what the amendment means for co-op and condo owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Primary residences: If you own your co-op or condo in your name and it is your primary residence, there is only good news. You are still eligible for the tax break. And owners of less expensive apartments, which are assessed at a lower value, benefit even more. (In fact, over 98 percent of primary residential units in the outer boroughs will receive an enhanced benefit as a result of this legislation, according to the Finance Department.) Under the old law, the abatement was 17.5 percent for an apartment with an assessed value of more than $15,000 and 25 percent for properties assessed at $15,000 or less. The new regulation increases the abatement for apartments assessed at $50,000 to 25 percent the first year and incrementally up to 28.1 percent in 2014/2015. Apartments assessed at $50,001 to $60,000 also get a bigger tax break than before. The 17.5 percent abatement continues to apply to the rest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second homes or investments: If you own the apartment in your own name but do not live there full time, you no longer qualify. This includes pieds-à-terre and most investment apartments that generate rental income. But the new rules preserve a provision of the initial law that allowed investors to claim the tax break if they lived in the building and owned up to three units, as someone who owned a three-family home might. If you own four or more units within the same building and one is your primary residence, none of the units are eligible for the abatement. Likewise, if you own three or fewer units and none of them are your primary residence, none of the units are eligible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trusts or LLCs: If your apartment is your primary residence and you own it in your name and in trust, then you still qualify for the abatement. But if you have placed the unit solely in a trust or in a limited-liability company, your abatement is being phased out -- even if you reside there full time. For the 2012/2013 fiscal tax year, which began in July, you will receive half the amount you would have received under the old law; for 2013/2014 you will receive 25 percent. By 2014/2015 you will no longer receive anything. The Department of Finance Web site offers more information at nyc.gov/ccabatement.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investing in a tangible asset like real estate may seem to offer a greater sense of control. You can walk through a house, after all, which somehow feels safer than subjecting your savings to the whims of the stock market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea of buying a house and renting it out may seem especially attractive now, with home prices [http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/business/economy/in-us-surprise-housing-demand-catches-industry-off-guard.html]still reasonable, though rising, in many places, and interest rates at levels practically begging you to borrow. And if you’re thinking about retirement[http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/retirement/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], the income can serve as an inflation-adjusted annuity of sorts, since rents are likely to rise over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But our perceptions can be deceiving. “There is a lot of idiosyncratic risk associated with rental income,” said Christopher J. Mayer, professor of real estate, finance and economics at Columbia Business School. “That is the word that economists use for when a lot of things can go wrong, even if on average they don’t go wrong very often.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom and Ana Vogel, a retired couple in their early 70s, are seasoned landlords. So they’re aware of the risks, having dealt with problematic tenants in the past. Still, with a sizable piece of their retirement savings tied up in certificates of deposit earning less than 1 percent, they thought they could do better by buying a house and renting it out. They recently bought a five-bedroom house in their hometown, Germantown, Md., for $350,000, and they expected about a 6 percent return on their investment, as well as some tax benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is high risk, you just have to be careful,” said Mr. Vogel, who worked as a geodesist and information technology manager for what was the Defense Mapping Agency. “You have no control over the stock market,” he added, explaining that they didn’t have the stomach for the volatility after losing half of the $100,000 they had invested in mutual funds during the market downturn in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a pension accounting for half of their retirement income, the couple may have more room for error than other retirees. They also paid for the property in cash — the C.D. money covered half, and they used a home equity loan[http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/loans/home-equity-loans/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] on their primary home to cover the remainder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you’re thinking about testing these waters, you can expect to compete with cash buyers like the Vogels — they represented 32.3 percent of home sales in February, according to the Campbell/Inside Mortgage Finance HousingPulse Tracking Survey[http://www.insidemortgagefinance.com/housing_pulse/]. But a lot of those investors have much deeper pockets. In certain spots across the Sunbelt, in particular, the homeowner next door may actually be a faceless private equity[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/private_equity/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] firm. The <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> and other Wall Street investors[http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/investors-vs-occupants-in-the-housing-recovery/?ref=catherinerampell] are gobbling up properties in places like the Tampa Bay area of Florida[http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/realestate/blackstone-other-investors-snap-up-thousands-of-tampa-bay-rental-homes/2110744] by the thousands. And their exit strategy could affect yours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jack McCabe, a real estate consultant in Deerfield Beach, Fla., said he had never seen large investors purchase so many homes in one fell swoop, giving them such great sway over pricing in the market. “A lot of the price increase is not due to a market that is getting healthy, but is due to the influx of hedge funds, and a high percentage of homes are selling at artificially inflated values,” Mr. McCabe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should you decide to follow the Vogels’ lead, there are a variety of calculations you should make, and concerns and questions you should have ahead of time, several of which are sketched out below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DO I NEED FINANCING? Taking out a mortgage obviously increases your financial risk, even if you believe there is a healthy spread between what you can charge in rent and what you owe on the mortgage (and other expenses). In fact, what you’re really doing is borrowing to expand the size of your investment portfolio, explained Professor Mayer, which can be particularly risky for retirees who are no longer working. “They can turn their $500,000 portfolio into $600,000 by borrowing, but if you told them you were going to borrow money to buy a REIT, people would say, ‘Gee, that’s really risky,’&nbsp;“ he said. “Well, then why is it less risky to do that with a rental property?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We don’t have to look back too far to remember what can happen if home values fall. “If stuff goes down in value, that leaves you much more exposed,” Professor Mayer said. “Borrowing money to earn a higher return involves risk.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAN I GET A MORTGAGE? Not only is getting a mortgage on an investment property more difficult than getting a loan on your primary home, it also tends to be more expensive. Mortgages on investment properties tend to carry slightly higher interest rates — anywhere from 0.25 of a percentage point to a full percentage point — and may require higher down payments, according to Keith Gumbinger of HSH.com[http://www.hsh.com/], a mortgage data firm. “Things can also get more complicated where the income from the property is needed to support the loan,” he added. “The purchaser may need to provide a rental history for the property, if any exists, or they may need to have a rental market analysis conducted.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AM I DIVERSIFIED ENOUGH? If you have a $600,000 portfolio, putting $300,000 into one asset is a highly concentrated bet. “People tend to mentally compartmentalize their investments, but really, you should be looking at them together,” Professor Mayer added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may also be hard to tap any equity locked up in the property. Refinancing that involves taking cash out is hard to obtain, and home equity loans or lines of credit are hard to come by on investment properties, Mr. Gumbinger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VACANCY OR DISASTER PLANS There are the traditional risks that come with being a landlord, like a prolonged vacancy, the possibility that the water heater will die right after you’ve installed a new roof, or that the tenants will lose their jobs or fail to pay for some other reason, which could lead to eviction. But several experts also said not to discount even more remote possibilities. If your property was in an area ravaged by Hurricane Sandy[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/h/hurricanes_and_tropical_storms/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], for instance, could you financially withstand several months of no rental income and the cost of repairs that might not be covered by homeowner’s insurance[http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/insurance/home-insurance/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] (and how much insurance[http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/insurance/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] is enough, and at what cost)?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You need to have a sizable reserve fund set aside to pay for expenses, whether it’s to cover the mortgage for a stretch when the property is sitting vacant or to make repairs, which novice landlords tend to underestimate,” said Kenneth J. Eaton, a financial planner[http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/planning/financial-planners/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] in Overland Park, Kan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAN I MANAGE IT MYSELF? Buying a rental property isn’t solely a financial decision. You need to be prepared to screen tenants, run credit checks and get the water heater repaired at a moment’s notice. That means you’re going to need to establish relationships with a variety of service people, or, if you have the time and ability, do it yourself. So be honest about how big of a commitment owning a house will really be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have never had pipes burst at a convenient time — they almost also go out in the middle of the night when you are out of town,” said Alan Moore, a financial planner in Milwaukee who has owned rental properties and counseled clients about the pros and cons of buying investment properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can outsource the job to a property manager, but they can collect anywhere from 4 to 10 percent of the annual rent, depending on where you live and a variety of other factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE TAX IMPLICATIONS Rental income is taxed at ordinary income rates, but experts say you can often post a tax loss while still generating a profit. That’s because you can deduct the depreciation of the rental — but not the underlying land — to account for wear and tear (the cost of improvements, closing costs and the cost of appliances are all depreciable, too). In most cases, the building is depreciated over 27.5 years. So if the actual structure is worth $200,000, you can deduct about $7,200 a year. Coupled with operating expenses, that is often enough to wipe out any profit on paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You’re allowed to write off up to $25,000 of losses against any type of income, as long as you own at least 10 percent of the rental property and have substantial involvement in managing the rental (if you don’t own 10 percent, the rules get more complicated), said Russell D. Francis, a certified public account and financial planner in Beaverton, Ore. But that $25,000 benefit begins to phase out if you have adjusted gross income of $100,000 and it disappears for people with adjusted gross income of $150,000 or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government reclaims part of your savings eventually. The depreciation is recaptured when you sell the property (on which you’ll also pay taxes on capital gains). You have to pay a flat 25 percent rate on the amount you depreciated, Mr. Francis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can put off paying capital gains if you exchange your property for another one — in something known as a 1031 exchange — or you can keep the house until you die. Since your heirs will inherit the property at the current market value, they will not have to pay a tax on the gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s also possible to own real property inside an individual retirement account, which my colleague Paul Sullivan wrote about [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/21/your-money/self-directed-iras-in-real-estate-need-investor-effort.html] last year, and which is subject to an entirely separate set of rules and regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONESTY ABOUT COSTS You may be tempted to view this sort of investment differently, meaning you may be more likely to continually dip into your personal assets to cover costs. ”Many small-business people wipe themselves out because as their business declines, they dip into their personal assets to keep things going,” said Daniel B. Moisand, a financial planner[http://www.moisandfitzgerald.com/] in Melbourne, Fla. “It is a fairly natural reaction because often things look like they are about to turn around. Unless you establish limits, you could find yourself doing the same at some point. If you do not believe your properties are subject to such risk, you shouldn’t buy properties.”</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction Appended</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many observers of the arcane world of commercial real estate investment, Scott Lawlor became a tarnished emblem for the aggressive investors who poured other people’s money into major office buildings at the height of the market, driving values into the stratosphere until the bubble burst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lawlor — who famously acquired the John Hancock Tower in Boston in 2006 and whose lenders then sold it at a substantial loss three years later — had his funds lose more than two-thirds of their value during the recession. Now with the real estate boom far behind him, he has quietly returned to commercial real estate investing, but instead of going after trophy buildings in big cities, he is buying up garden apartment complexes in much smaller towns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than $3.5 billion in property deals that involved Mr. Lawlor’s private equity[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/private_equity/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] fund, <span class="companylink">Broadway Real Estate Partners</span>, had financing trouble during the downturn, but all those deals have since been restructured or otherwise resolved, with billions lost in the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Lawlor is not proud of that record, he isn’t hiding from it either. But he appears to have given his investment approach an extreme makeover. Instead of prominent buildings in places like New York and Boston, he is buying residential complexes in secondary and tertiary markets like Greenville, S.C. and Maryville, Tenn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of raising a huge fund from institutions with the discretion to invest as he chooses, he now raises capital deal by individual deal from an array of deep-pocketed private investors. He has also given up on borrowing heavily and using short-term floating-rate debt to pay for at least 80 percent of a building’s cost — a strategy that got Broadway and an army of other real estate investors into trouble a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lawlor says he now obtains long-term, fixed-rate financing for just 60 percent of an asset’s total cost, including renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking back at his former approach, he said, “I’m never going to be in that situation again. What we are doing now is very different.” His new strategy, he said, is long-term and conservative. “It’s not sexy, and there’s no loss of sleep and very little risk.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His basic strategy: finding relatively small deals — around $20 million — in markets that larger investors are passing up, and instead of seeking spectacular returns for his backers, he aims to get them steady, reliable income over a seven- to 10-year period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lawlor has certainly chosen his markets well. According to the <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span> Commercial Property Price Index, apartment prices in the Southeast have been rising more slowly than in the country as a whole, and are still nearly 25 percent below average prices at the market peak; that’s well off the national average for apartments of just 8 percent below peak levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ronald Johnsey, the president of apartment research firm Axiometrics, said that the strategy that Mr. Lawlor’s new investment vehicle, Waypoint Residential Management, has adopted was a good one. “They are going into submarkets that appear to have been overlooked in terms of new supply,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners have deferred improvements to their second-tier properties in places like Greenville, S.C., as they struggled — and often failed — to hold on to ownership. So rents have not budged, while they have risen for top-quality buildings, said Tony Bonitati, director of the multifamily division of NAI Earle Furman in Greenville, a commercial real estate services firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last quarter of 2012, according to Axiometrics, average class B rents in Greenville averaged 65 percent behind class A rents, up from a historical spread of 48 percent. A similar spread is evident in other Waypoint markets like Orlando.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These investments may look simple on the surface, but Mr. Lawlor still has an appetite for what he calls “hairy” situations — deals that require some effort beyond a simple buy-and-hold strategy if the full value of the investment is to be realized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“From time to time,” he said, Waypoint will invest in “special situations that are bigger and more complicated.” In the deal that represents Waypoint’s largest buyout effort to date, the company acquired a 49 percent stake in a pool of four distressed apartment properties, with more than 1,100 units, across the Southeast. Although the noncontrolling stake means Waypoint still has a lot of work to do to gain ownership of what Mr. Lawlor calls “an extraordinary investment opportunity,” he said the deal “gets us in the door.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also last year, Waypoint, which is based in Greenwich, Conn., bought 198 units in a failed condo project in Orlando for $25.1 million — half the price paid by the previous investor who undertook a condo conversion, but was foreclosed on before completion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That buyer sold 10 percent of the units as condos before losing the property, so Waypoint now owns 90 percent of the remaining units. These are fully rented and producing income, according to a market source familiar with the deal who was not authorized to speak about it, but real success will come for Waypoint if it can gain control of the condo association and eventually unite the property under one owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In complicated transactions like these, where his investors will receive income while Waypoint pursues greater control, Mr. Lawlor believes the returns outweigh the uncertainty of when, or whether, he can unlock the properties’ full value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2011, Waypoint has acquired at least 2,412 apartments in 10 properties and has developed or is building 518 units in two projects. Mr. Lawlor placed the value of these assets at around $300 million, although Waypoint has invested far less than that by engaging in various partnerships, buying distressed properties and avoiding competitive auctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To strengthen its operations, Waypoint last year acquired a multifamily property management company in Florida[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/florida/index.html?inline=nyt-geo]. The company already had some 7,000 units under management before adding Waypoint’s acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another point of departure for Mr. Lawlor is where he is finding his capital. Instead of institutions like pension funds and insurance companies, his investors are wealthy people looking for long-term income at rates higher than Treasury yields. “There’s an opportunity to fill a void in the real estate capital markets,” he said, pointing not to investors who want to invest $1 million or $2 million, but those who might want to put $20 million or $30 million into real estate. “That market is underserved,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albert Zdenek, president and chief executive of Traust Sollus Wealth Management in Manhattan[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/manhattan/?inline=nyt-geo], said his clients appreciated both the yield and the transparency offered by vehicles like Waypoint, although he disputes that his clients are “underserved” in real estate choices. Still, his clients, he said, appreciate “having an asset class with steady returns,” especially if they can “buy in at the bottom.” In addition, he said the opportunity to examine individual property deals beforehand is attractive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last but not least, attractive financing from the government-sponsored agencies <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> also helps Mr. Lawlor’s efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Sykes, senior vice president at Beech Street Capital in Bethesda, Md., says there exists “one of the largest differentials between interest rates and cap rates” — or return on investment — “ in history.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All these factors support Waypoint’s bread-and-butter investment thesis and, Mr. Lawlor thinks, its growth potential. Always a driven real estate investor, his mind is on expansion. With offices already in Greenwich, Atlanta and South Florida[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/great-homes-and-destinations/destinations/south-florida/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], he said Waypoint was poised to add a Dallas office charged with exploring adjacent states for investment opportunities. From there, he believes, states like Colorado[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/great-homes-and-destinations/destinations/mountain-states/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] and Arizona[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/great-homes-and-destinations/destinations/southwest/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] are a logical step.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But regardless of how active Waypoint becomes, Mr. Lawlor said he would not give in to the temptation to pile on liability. “The last person you’re going to hear about piling on aggressive debt is me,” he said. “You don’t have to risk getting your clock cleaned to still make a terrific deal.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: March 29, 2013, Friday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on the Square Feet pages on Wednesday about the return to commercial real estate investing by Scott Lawlor, a major office building investor before the financial crisis, misstated the amount of property deals involving his private equity fund that faced financing trouble during the downturn.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ORTLEY BEACH, N.J. -- In a typical summer, Terriann and Joseph LoVerde's rental here makes for a listing a real estate broker called a real moneymaker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A block from the beach! Walk to town! Two units and a cottage in back -- bring the extended family!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, they would have to include a few caveats: Hurricane Sandy wiped out walls and windows, after washing away three houses between the LoVerdes' and the beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here in the heart of the Jersey Shore, the warmer days of spring hint at the promise of summer: Ice cream at the Music Man, breakfasts at the Sunny Hunny. But roofs that were swept off by the storm still rest beside the main street. Beaches have been shortened by 30 or 40 feet, leaving no promise that one's favorite spot to lay down a towel can still be found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses like the LoVerdes' are not available, and renters are staying away even from homes that are rentable, fearing that things look far bleaker now than they do in the sun-baked memories of summers past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Putting myself in their shoes, I'd be thinking, why would I go there?'' Mrs. LoVerde said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A state report on tourism released last week called it the $22 billion question: Will the shore be ready for summer? Rentals are the key to that, and to the shore economy, which in turn generates half of the state's $40 billion tourist market. With fewer renters, restaurants and stores do not see as much business, cannot hire as many people, or generate as much tax revenue for a state already suffering from losses to the property base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two months before Memorial Day, at a time when many properties would already be fully booked for summer, people along this stretch of the coast have some idea where the absentees have gone. In the southern end of the state, where the storm caused little damage, rentals and hotels are filling up faster than in most years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As if to rub it in, Sea Isle City is advertising on a billboard outside the Lincoln Tunnel, hoping to attract people from New York and New Jersey who might otherwise have vacationed farther north. ''We're ready,'' it declares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers here say the storm wiped out 90 percent of the rental properties in places like Ortley Beach, Deauville Beach and Normandy Beach, and a significant share even in places where dunes fended off the worst damage. Even some houses that are ready to rent are having a hard time finding tenants; it's no one's idea of a summer vacation to see a house off its foundation two doors down, or hear contractors up the street sawing at 7 a.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric Birchler, who runs a real estate firm here that his family has owned for 50 years, said he normally rents 400 houses a year, 100 of them in Ortley Beach alone. This year, he has rented two here. (Homes typically rent by the week, for anywhere from $1,600 for a basic bungalow to $12,000 for a modern oceanfront house.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Are people going to go to Southern Jersey or the Maryland beaches or Florida?'' he asked. ''We'd have to be crazy to think otherwise.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lee Childers, whose real estate firm works out of five offices along the coast, normally rents 800 houses a summer, but so far this year he has done about 5 percent of that. Many renters from last year had put down deposits in anticipation of returning; with the damage, he has already given two-thirds of those their money back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even towns like Lavallette and Seaside Park, where the houses are in better shape, are suffering from the perception problem. Some are trying to assuage the fears of prospective visitors by offering renters' insurance for the first time, which would allow people to recoup their money in case of evacuation or damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's such bad publicity with a roller coaster still in the ocean,'' Mr. Childers said. ''Will people from North Jersey say, 'Oh, Seaside Park is O.K., but Ortley isn't?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly, there are signs of a resurrection along the shore. Contractors' trucks are everywhere. The A.&amp;P. in Ortley Beach is open again, and so is the hardware store in Lavallette, next door, and up the street from that, the Crab's Claw Inn. Front-end loaders level the sand on the beaches, and machines hammer pilings for new boardwalks, beating a path toward summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gov. Chris Christie has pledged that the shore will be ''open for business'' by Memorial Day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But along Route 35, which bisects this barrier island between the Atlantic Ocean and Barnegat Bay, mountains of sand wait to be sifted, to clear it of potentially dangerous debris. On the bay side, a playground and a pizza restaurant slope toward a sinkhole. The State Police patrol the roads, and block access to the beaches. Cars still slow down along Route 35 to take in the sight of houses torn in half, and the roller coaster still sticks like a mangled limb out of the ocean off Seaside Heights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How attractive the community may be is a question mark,'' said Bob Navitski, who has removed more than 100 cubic yards of sand from the yellow house that he rents out on an oceanfront block in Ortley Beach. The water washed in by the storm was 29 inches deep. He has given up on renting it this summer, though he relies on the $3,500 in weekly rent to pay his mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In my opinion it will be five years to recover,'' he said. ''I don't mean five years until we rent it -- five years until the scars are gone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only upside, he said, is that his family, which usually has to use the house more during the off-season, might get some extra summer weeks this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Years ago, Mark Fusari moved his money from the stock market into the four beach houses he owns here ''because of so much volatility.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You could say the Dow has dropped 5,000 for me now,'' he said. His houses are ready to rent, but with so much wreckage around them, they have been slow to go. The last week of August has drawn the most interest, because tenants expect that by then the shore will look more like what they are accustomed to. Though the rentals normally produce about $100,000 a summer, Mr. Fusari thinks he will be lucky to make half that this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dee Lanzalotti, a broker in Cape May, at the southern tip of the state, said her rentals are up 42 percent. ''Two days after the storm we got calls from people who already had leases saying, 'This is what we were renting there, do you have something that might be comparable?' '' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In nearby Sea Isle City, whose Chamber of Commerce leased the billboard outside the Lincoln Tunnel, a spike in rentals suggests they have succeeded in poaching some vacationers from the New York City area. ''We're going to have a very good summer as a result,'' said Christopher Glancey, the chamber president and a real estate broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here in Ortley Beach, landlords and brokers are hoping that as the weather warms, fondness for the shore will replace fear. ''I think people will rent more out of 'We want to support the rebuilding,' rather than 'It's going to be a great summer,' '' said Tim O'Shea, a broker who lost his own home and two rental units here in the storm. ''People don't have a lot of faith in the fact that there's going to be much of a summer.''</p>
<p>In Lavallette, N.J., repairs to homes, the boardwalk and the  beach, all damaged during Hurricane Sandy, are continuing.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDFor many observers of the arcane world of commercial real estate investment, Scott Lawlor became a tarnished emblem for the aggressive investors who poured other people's money into major office buildings at the height of the market, driving values into the stratosphere until the bubble burst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lawlor -- who famously acquired the John Hancock Tower in Boston in 2006 and whose lenders then sold it at a substantial loss three years later -- had his funds lose more than two-thirds of their value during the recession. Now with the real estate boom far behind him, he has quietly returned to commercial real estate investing, but instead of going after trophy buildings in big cities, he is buying up garden apartment complexes in much smaller towns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than $3.5 billion in property deals that involved Mr. Lawlor's private equity fund, <span class="companylink">Broadway Real Estate Partners</span>, had financing trouble during the downturn, but all those deals have since been restructured or otherwise resolved, with billions lost in the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Lawlor is not proud of that record, he isn't hiding from it either. But he appears to have given his investment approach an extreme makeover. Instead of prominent buildings in places like New York and Boston, he is buying residential complexes in secondary and tertiary markets like Greenville, S.C. and Maryville, Tenn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of raising a huge fund from institutions with the discretion to invest as he chooses, he now raises capital deal by individual deal from an array of deep-pocketed private investors. He has also given up on borrowing heavily and using short-term floating-rate debt to pay for at least 80 percent of a building's cost -- a strategy that got Broadway and an army of other real estate investors into trouble a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lawlor says he now obtains long-term, fixed-rate financing for just 60 percent of an asset's total cost, including renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking back at his former approach, he said, ''I'm never going to be in that situation again. What we are doing now is very different.'' His new strategy, he said, is long-term and conservative. ''It's not sexy, and there's no loss of sleep and very little risk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His basic strategy: finding relatively small deals -- around $20 million -- in markets that larger investors are passing up, and instead of seeking spectacular returns for his backers, he aims to get them steady, reliable income over a seven- to 10-year period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lawlor has certainly chosen his markets well. According to the <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span> Commercial Property Price Index, apartment prices in the Southeast have been rising more slowly than in the country as a whole, and are still nearly 25 percent below average prices at the market peak; that's well off the national average for apartments of just 8 percent below peak levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ronald Johnsey, the president of apartment research firm Axiometrics, said that the strategy that Mr. Lawlor's new investment vehicle, Waypoint Residential Management, has adopted was a good one. ''They are going into submarkets that appear to have been overlooked in terms of new supply,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners have deferred improvements to their second-tier properties in places like Greenville, S.C., as they struggled -- and often failed -- to hold on to ownership.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last quarter of 2012, according to Axiometrics, average class B rents in Greenville averaged 65 percent behind class A rents, up from a historical spread of 48 percent. A similar spread is evident in other Waypoint markets like Orlando.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE BUZZ IS LOUD these days about South Americans buying Miami and New York condos at a furious pace, helping to stoke high-end residential boomlets in those cities. But back home, their own real estate markets have started to lure investment from big-name American real estate companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers like the <span class="companylink">Related Group of Florida</span>, in a joint venture with the Related Companies based in New York, and Donald J. Trump, as well as real estate investors like the billionaire Sam Zell, are working to build residential housing and commercial spaces in Brazil, Uruguay and Colombia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, those countries were not seen as very safe bets by many foreign real estate developers. Now Brazil, especially, has become the object of a lot of attention. Take a gander at the numbers and you quickly understand why.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of a four-bedroom apartment in Ipanema, one of the posh beach neighborhoods in Rio de Janeiro, rose nearly sixfold from 2008 to 2012, exceeding $2.5 million. The rise was helped by hype over large offshore oil finds and the announcement that Rio had won the 2016 Olympics. Even in Rio's grittier downtown, one-bedroom apartments saw a threefold increase in sales price in those years. In São Paulo, Brazil's largest city, average residential prices doubled during that period, to $335 per square foot. Construction of residential buildings, especially in São Paulo, where I lived in 2011 in the latter part of my time as a correspondent in Brazil, seemed to be nonstop only a few years ago. In the upscale neighborhood of Itaim Bibi I was literally surrounded by the construction of high-end condo buildings, with workers toiling away on Saturdays and sometimes Sundays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past Brazilians with money may have been thinking solely about how to park it outside their country. Today rising incomes and one of the longest sustained periods of economic stability in the country's history have given many Brazilians the confidence to invest at home as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Someone from the interior of Brazil, who in the past would have bought a home in Paris or New York, will now buy it in Rio,'' said José Conde Caldas, president of the Association of Directors of Real Estate Companies in Rio de Janeiro, who predicts strong growth at least through the 2016 Rio Olympics. In his 41 years in real estate, he added, ''this is the best time of all the times.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hot Rio property market ''has much more to do with demographics than any one-time events like the Olympics,'' said Pedro Seixas de Corrêa, a professor at the <span class="companylink">Getúlio Vargas Foundation</span> in Rio who lectures on real estate management. ''This is because of the country's rising incomes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunes were made in the recent economic boom. São Paulo and Rio are now the 9th- and 10th-ranked cities in the world for high-net-worth individuals with at least $30 million in wealth, according to Knight Frank, a real estate company in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But are those times ending? Lately, sales of new residential properties have tapered off. In both Rio and São Paulo the number of new residential development units peaked in 2010. Residential sales in São Paulo fell by nearly 5 percent last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction costs are rising, in large part from a shortage of skilled labor that is causing construction delays. In Rio, costs rose by 39 percent per square foot over the past five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a serious problem,'' Mr. Caldas said, adding that developers were recruiting laborers from other Brazilian states. The end next month of a major project to upgrade Maracanã soccer stadium for the 2014 World Cup should free up some 6,000 laborers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The political will to cut down on red tape and keep the construction boom going seems to be there, at least in Rio, Roberto Kauffmann, president of Rio's Civil Engineering Industry Syndicate, said in a recent interview in Rome, where he spoke to Italian investors about opportunities in Rio. ''We have created conditions to be able to overcome bureaucracy,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any event the challenges haven't dissuaded developers like Jorge Pérez, chairman of Related Group, based in Miami, who is making a sizable bet on Brazil's need for new upscale housing over the next decade. Related established a Brazilian subsidiary a year ago and is developing its first mixed-use projects in São Paulo, with an eye to the Rio market as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''São Paulo had a period of overbuilding and has quieted down the past few years,'' Mr. Pérez said. But ''we feel that Brazil over the next decade will have a much greater growth rate than the United States, and definitely than Europe. There will be bumps on the road, like all development markets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related Brasil is investing $100 million in a multitower mixed-use complex in the upscale neighborhood of Morumbi. It will have condominiums, offices, retail space and a hotel. The first phase, expected to begin construction next year, will have five towers with 672 units. The second will be even larger, he said. Mr. Pérez described the apartments as ''upper-middle-class condos'' in buildings with swimming pools, gardens, tennis courts and ''acres of green space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related's Brazilian development partner, Bueno Netto Construction, is also investing $100 million, Mr. Pérez said. The project awaits approval by Brazilian officials, but Mr. Pérez hopes to start advance marketing on it within the next 90 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related is also working on two other luxury projects in São Paulo, and is scouring Rio for opportunities in the Port Zone, which the city is revitalizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among those involved with Related Brasil is Clifford Sobel, a former American ambassador, who wrote in a 2007 diplomatic cable, released by <span class="companylink">Wikileaks</span> and reported by a Brazilian watchdog publication, that ''the honeymoon is just beginning'' for American investors in Brazil's real estate market. Mr. Sobel called former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva ''the best president for the real estate sector that Brazil has ever had.'' Mr. Sobel wrote the enthusiastic message after a meeting with the president of Cyrela, one of the largest residential developers in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Rio, the <span class="companylink">Trump Organization</span> is licensing the Trump name for a multi-billion-dollar office complex in the Port Zone area, which is intended to be a posh new urban center with tens of thousands of residents. The project, which Trump is working on with the Bulgarian developer MRP International, will encompass five towers with a total of 4.5 million square feet of commercial space, said Donald Trump, Jr., who is overseeing the project. ''It may be the largest urban office development in all of the BRIC countries,'' he said, using the acronym for Brazil, Russia, India and China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the developers are still waiting on some government approvals, Mr. Trump expects at least one of the towers to be completed by the Olympics in three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next door to Brazil, in Uruguay, Trump is lending its name to a luxury condo building in the resort playground of Punta del Este. The $100 million development, which will have 129 apartments on 25 floors, will overlook the beach. Sales started in January. So far potential buyers include Americans, Uruguayans, Argentines, Brazilians and Europeans, said Eric Trump, who is overseeing it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for standard units will range from $650,000 to $2.5 million. The penthouses, which will have 6,500 to 8,600 square feet of space and private pools and spas, have yet to be priced. A Trump spokeswoman would not say how many apartments were already under contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Americans making real estate investments in Latin America include Mr. Zell. Through <span class="companylink">Equity International</span>, which he founded with Gary Garrabrant in 1999, Mr. Zell is investing in real estate--related companies around the world, in countries including Brazil and Colombia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Equity International</span> has an investment in a residential builder based in the southern Brazilian city of Curitiba. And in Colombia, a country beset over past decades by rebel attacks that left many foreign investors skittish, <span class="companylink">Equity International</span> has a $75 million investment in Bogotá-based Terranum Corporate Properties, which is developing a two-million-square-foot mixed-use complex near Bogotá's El Dorado International Airport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Heneghan, the chief executive of Equity International, said interest in Colombia was growing among global real estate investors. ''The marketplace will begin to get more crowded, as we've seen in Brazil,'' he predicted.</p>
<p>In Uruguay, the Trump  Organization is licensing its  name to a luxury condo  building, above, in Punta del  Este. Related Brasil and a  partner are building a  mixed-use complex, right, in  the upscale Morumbi  neighborhood of São Paulo.  (PHOTOGRAPHS BY RELATED BRASIL; YY DEVELOPMENT GROUP) (RE4)   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE first couple of years of economic recovery after the Great Recession were notable for one no-show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing industry made no contribution at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now it appears that industry is finally starting to recover. Housing starts are rising at a rapid rate, albeit from a very low level. And last year, residential construction spending, adjusted for inflation, climbed 12 percent, after declining for a record six consecutive years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Census Bureau reported this week that single-family housing starts rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 618,000 in February, the highest level since June 2008, months before the collapse of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> turned a recession into a global credit crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last 12 months, 551,000 single-family units were started, and an additional 255,000 multifamily units. As is shown in the accompanying charts, that was an increase of 28 percent from the period a year earlier. Not since the early 1980s, when the economy was coming out of a double-dip recession caused in large part by soaring interest rates that made homes unaffordable, had starts risen so rapidly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as can also be seen from the charts, the recovery has not propelled the housing industry far. The total level of starts is still lower than at any time before the recession, and in the fourth quarter of last year, the residential construction industry accounted for only 2.6 percent of the total gross domestic product. That figure was up from the low, reached in mid-2009, of just 2.2 percent, but it was far below the 6.3 percent reached in late 2005, when the housing bubble was at its peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time housing construction contributed so little to the economy was during World War II.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In normal economic recoveries, housing construction supplies a substantial part of the growth recorded in the first year or two after the recession ends. But in this recovery, it kept shrinking. Over all, real housing spending contracted in every year from 2006 to 2011. But the 12 percent gain last year was the fastest since 1993, another period of recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building industry, devastated by the collapse of the boom, is only starting to recover. The number of new homes offered for sale peaked at 570,000 in mid-2006, as the boom was ending, and many of the homes built then took years to sell. The latest figures show that only 150,000 new homes were offered for sale in January, including houses that are planned as well as those partly or completely built. That is up only a little from the low of 142,000 reached last summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes being offered before construction begins has remained close to level for two years at a little more than a quarter of the peak. That is a sign that few new communities have been started, despite the rise in housing starts.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes reached a three-year high in February and their prices rose, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>said on Thursday[http://www.realtor.org/news-releases/2013/03/existing-home-sales-and-prices-continue-to-rise-in-february], adding to signs of an acceleration in the housing recovery even though the supply of properties on the market increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association said sales increased 0.8 percent to an annual rate of 4.98 million units last month, the highest level since November 2009. The January sales rate was revised up to 4.94 million units from the previously reported 4.92 million units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Reuters had expected sales to rise to a five-million-unit rate. Homes took about 74 days to sell in February, according to the median estimate, down from 97 days a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report, the Labor Department said the number of Americans seeking unemployment aid barely changed last week[http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/eta/ui/current.htm], while the average over the last month fell to a five-year low. The decline in layoffs is helping to strengthen the job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weekly unemployment benefit applications rose just 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 336,000, the department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last four weeks, the average number of applications has dropped by 7,500, to 339,750. That is the lowest level since February 2008, just three months into the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a third economic report, the <span class="companylink">Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank</span> said its business activity index rose[http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/regional-economy/business-outlook-survey/2013/bos0313.pdf] to 2 from minus 12.5 in February, topping economists’ expectations for minus 2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region’s manufacturing. The survey covers factories in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware. Before March’s gain, the index had contracted in three of the last four months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders rose to 0.5 from minus 7.8, while inventories rose to zero from minus 10. The gauge of the number of employees gained to 2.7 from 0.9, but the average employee workweek dropped to minus 12.9 from minus 1.6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey is seen as one of the first monthly indicators of the health of manufacturing in the nation. Survey respondents’ view on the coming months perked up slightly with the gauge of business conditions for the next six months rising to 32.5, from 32.1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in home sales last month was the latest indication that the housing market was gaining more ground. Data this week showed builders broke ground on more houses in February and permits for future construction approached a five-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“With buying conditions remaining very supportive to demand and overall economic fundamentals continuing to improve, we expect the momentum in housing activity to improve further, providing a supportive backdrop for the recovery more generally,” said Millan Mulraine, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>’s monetary policy, holding mortgage rates near record lows, is helping to lift the housing market and bolster the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the inventory of unsold homes on the market increased 9.6 percent to 1.94 million. That represented a 4.7 months’ supply at February’s sales rate, up from 4.3 months in January, the first increase since April. Inventories typically rise in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the months’ supply remained below the six-month level that is normally considered a healthy balance of supply and demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since surging in August, home resales have increased only modestly, an indication that tight supplies in some parts of the country are constraining sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home sales price in February rose 11.6 percent from a year ago, to $173,6000.</p>

</div><div class="author">By CATHERINE RAMPELL   </div><div>1425 words</div><div>21 March 2013</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACRAMENTO — After six years of waiting on the sidelines, newly eager home buyers across the country are discovering that there are not enough houses for sale to accommodate the recent flush of demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In my 27 years I’ve never seen inventories this low,” said Kurt K. Colgan[http://myagent.golyon.com/home/?ID=40802], a broker with Lyon Real Estate[http://golyon.com/] in the Sacramento metropolitan area, where the share of homes on the market has plummeted by one of the largest amounts in the nation. “I’ve also never seen a market turn so quickly.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing turnaround seems to have caught almost everyone in the business by surprise. As desirable as the long-awaited improvement may be, the unusually low level of homes for sale is creating widespread problems for buyers and sellers alike, leading to bidding wars and bubblelike price jumps in places that not long ago were suffering from major declines. In the Sacramento area, where the housing bust took an especially heavy toll, the median sales price has surged 15 percent over the last year, according to Zillow[http://www.zillowblog.com/research/data/].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, sales prices rose 7.3 percent over the course of 2012, according to the Standard &amp; Poor’s Case-Shiller[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/standard_poors_caseshiller_home_price_index/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] index, ranging from a slight decline in New York to a surge of 23 percent in Phoenix. Tracking more closely with the national trend were cities like Dallas, up 6.5 percent; Tampa, which rose 7.2 percent; and Denver, which gained 8.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many areas, builders are scrambling to ramp up production but face delays because of the difficulty of finding construction workers and in obtaining permits from suddenly overwhelmed local authorities. At the same time, homeowners — many of them lifted above water for the first time in years — often remain reluctant to sell, either because they want to wait and see how much further prices will climb or because they are afraid of being displaced in the sudden buying frenzy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You see a home go for sale and within a couple days there are three, four, six offers,” said Carrie Miskawi, a mother of three young children who has been looking for a new home for the last six months with Mr. Colgan’s help. She and her husband have decided not to put their current home on the market because they fear it will be snatched up before they have a chance to bid successfully on a new one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s kind of a Catch-22,” Mr. Colgan said. As long as large numbers of people are hesitant to put their own homes on the market because so few other homes are available, he said, there won’t be many homes available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the country, the raw number of homes for sale is at its lowest level since 1999, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. In the Sacramento metro area, home listings were down 60 percent in January from a year earlier, compared with 23 percent for the country over all, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories have been whittled down largely because new construction ground to a standstill for several years. Investors large and small have also scooped up most of the backlog of foreclosures[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/foreclosures/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and short sales; about 40 percent of all homes bought in Sacramento County over the last year were purchased by owners who currently live at a different address, according to county records and title data provided by the <span class="companylink">Fidelity National Title Insurance Company</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But steady job growth has put more people back to work, and families that put off moving because they couldn’t afford it are finally ready to do so. “Distressed” sales are down and conventional sales are up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extraordinarily low mortgage rates don’t hurt, either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The recovery is real,” said John Burns, chief executive of John Burns Real Estate Consulting[http://www.realestatconsulting.com]. “But the pace of the recovery has an artificial component to it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real estate agents in Sacramento, like Tom Phillips[http://tphillips.golyon.com/home/?ID=5744], have resorted to knocking on doors in desirable neighborhoods to see if the owners might, if asked nicely and promised a healthy gain, sell to one of his clients. One couple he represents, Darcey and Jason Schmelzer, just moved into a yearlong rental with their two boys because they sold before they could find a new place. They received four offers on the first day they put their home on the market, with the winning bid about $10,000 above asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the builders who survived the collapse, the tight market is a signal to get back to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly permits for single-family homes in the Sacramento area more than doubled from January 2012 to January 2013, though they are still only a quarter of the level they reached during the bubble. Nationally, the construction industry added 48,000 jobs in February, the biggest increase since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing upturn looks set to continue, finally adding a crucial element of support to the slowly improving economy. The government reported Tuesday that housing permits, while far below their peak, surged in February to their highest level since June 2008, an increase of nearly 34 percent from a year earlier. But it will still be many months before new homes now going through the approval process will be ready to move in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Home Company[http://thenewhomecompany.com/] has ramped up building as fast as it can, said Kevin S. Carson, the president of the company’s Northern California division. Founded in 2009 by the veterans of a major home builder that filed for bankruptcy during the crisis, the company plans to build 120 homes in Northern California this year, in contrast to 50 homes last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction is expected to take longer than usual, though, and expenses are rising, Mr. Carson said. That is primarily because after six years of almost no local building, skilled labor is scarce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many workers in the immigrant-heavy industry have left the area, returning to Mexico and other points south. Others pursued work in Texas’s energy boom, where both drilling and construction jobs have become more plentiful. Those who stayed in the local area often switched to medical data entry, U.P.S. delivery services, or anything else that they could find. Or they filed for disability and dropped out the labor force altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some, like the 38-year-old electrician Gideon Jacks, are gingerly returning to construction work after taking a hiatus (in Mr. Jacks’s case, the hiatus was in several low-paying jobs at restaurants), but others remain reluctant to return to the hard physical labor and unstable job prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They say, ‘That’s the last time I’m riding that roller coaster,’&nbsp;” said Rick Wylie, president of the Beutler Corporation[http://www.beutlercorp.com/], a Sacramento air-conditioning and plumbing company. In 2005 he employed 2,100 workers, but by 2009 Beutler had only 270 employees. Mr. Wylie, who currently employs about 550, is now having trouble luring back many workers he let go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don’t mean to complain,” he said. “This is a good problem to have, a world-class problem, to not be able to find workers to do all the work you’re getting.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shortages aren’t limited to the workers toiling in the hot sun, either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You walk into the permit office, and it’s like a ghost town in there,” said Michael Haemmig, president of Haemmig Construction[http://www.haemmig.com/] in Nevada City, Calif., about an hour north of Sacramento. He says local governments were caught off-guard by the suddenly renewed interest in building and do not have enough people in place to handle the paperwork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This being California, we have more regulations and permits than ever, and it takes more time to get each permit approved,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For builders still hesitant to dive into the market too deeply, such delays may actually be welcome, since they help buy more time for prices to rise further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If we could build 500 houses right now, could we sell them?” asked Harry Elliott III, president of Elliott Homes[http://www.elliotthomes.com/], a century-old company that built 250 homes last year and plans 350 this year, compared with a high of 1,400 in 2006. “Possibly, but I don’t want to sell all my lots that I’ve held on to forever and have to give them away at these prices.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We lost money for a lot of years, and I’d like to make some money for a change,” he added. “I’m not building because I need the practice.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding a new place to live used to be all about hunting through the real estate pages of local newspapers or endless hours working through an agent's files. If you were lucky, you would find a house or apartment to buy or rent that matched your needs and your wallet. But it could be a thankless and time-consuming task.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the smartphone in your pocket has swept this low-tech process aside, and there are many apps to help you find a new home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real Estate by Zillow on iOS, which is called Zillow Real Estate on Android and Windows Phone is one of the most comprehensive apps of this type -- and one of the easiest to interact with, particularly in its iPad version. This app can help you find a home to rent or buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the iPad edition, the main screen is split between a map view of the area you are interested in and a right panel that is context-dependent. When you are in ''search'' mode, which is activated by tapping the search bar at the top of the screen, the right menu shows you several search filters. These include properties for sale or rent, parameters like prices, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage and so on. The app has an option to show ''Zestimate'' prices, which is Zillow's guesstimate for the market value of many homes across the United States, a figure that might influence your house-buying deliberations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Search results are shown in the map section, with an icon representing each property. The right screen lists these properties, each with a photo and some basic details about the location. Tapping on a property takes you to a detailed summary page, similar to the printout a real estate agent would give you. Unlike a printout, however, this page is interactive, so you can add a note or a photo that you've taken. One nice extra is the ability to define a map search area by drawing a circle on the screen. It is satisfying to scribble around an area on the map and think ''I want to live there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One challenge is that sometimes, such as when you are refining a search you have already carried out, the app's menu layout can be confusing. The Windows Phone edition also is not as complete as the Android and iOS versions. For example, it lacks the ability to draw around an area of interest on the map."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real Estate by <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> is an alternative that is also free on iOS and Android. It displays best in the tablet version, but the smartphone edition works in a similar way. This app resembles Zillow's. But the app feels more professional, and its design is less fussy, with simpler menus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> excels is in the additional data it gives about the area being searched. Tapping the ''layers'' icon on the map section activates data-rich overlays on the map to help you narrow your potential property list. On the iPad, these layers include a crime map, a colorful ''heat map'' showing average sales price in the area, the locations of schools or banks, and ZIP code boundaries. A neat setting shows only properties that have recently been reduced in price. One criticism of <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> is that navigating its options requires a lot of tapping. It is slightly laborious to use, particularly if you're hunting through hundreds of potential homes, designating some as favorites as you go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Redfin Real Estate, free on Android and iOS, is full of the same sorts of data as the Zillow and <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> apps, but has a fast interface. It also has visual cues, like arrows that wobble on the screen to remind you how to swap between a map search view and detailed info on a property. But this app is useful only for certain areas of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a different home-finding experience, you can use the augmented reality app Layar (free on iOS and Android). Type ''real estate'' into its search engine, and it will probably bring up a real estate service that is local to you. Tapping on this activates Layar's augmented reality mode; hold your phone up, and the app displays relevant properties in a view of the world taken through your phone's camera. This may not offer as much detailed data as other apps, but it works. And it makes the process more fun. I used it to find a property I'm trying to buy. QUICK CALL Oreo Skies is an entertaining take on augmented reality astronomy for <span class="companylink">Nokia</span> Lumia Windows Phones. It uses your phone's sensors to display a chart of the night sky above you. But it also ties in to <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, so you can leave messages for your friends and family dotted among the stars. It is free.</p>
<p>Home shopping apps, showing  search results for San Francisco, include  Real Estate and Homes by Trulia,  above, Real Estate by Zillow,  above right, and Redfin Real Estate,  right. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACRAMENTO -- After six years of waiting on the sidelines, newly eager home buyers across the country are discovering that there are not enough houses for sale to accommodate the recent flush of demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In my 27 years I've never seen inventories this low,'' said Kurt K. Colgan, a broker with Lyon Real Estate in the Sacramento metropolitan area, where the share of homes on the market has plummeted by one of the largest amounts in the nation. ''I've also never seen a market turn so quickly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing turnaround seems to have caught almost everyone in the business by surprise. As desirable as the long-awaited improvement may be, the unusually low level of homes for sale is creating widespread problems for buyers and sellers alike, leading to bidding wars and bubblelike price jumps in places that not long ago were suffering from major declines. In the Sacramento area, where the housing bust took an especially heavy toll, the median sales price has surged 15 percent over the last year, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, sales prices rose 7.3 percent over the course of 2012, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller index, ranging from a slight decline in New York to a surge of 23 percent in Phoenix. Tracking more closely with the national trend were cities like Dallas, up 6.5 percent; Tampa, which rose 7.2 percent; and Denver, which gained 8.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many areas, builders are scrambling to ramp up production but face delays because of the difficulty of finding construction workers and in obtaining permits from suddenly overwhelmed local authorities. At the same time, homeowners -- many of them lifted above water for the first time in years -- often remain reluctant to sell, either because they want to wait and see how much further prices will climb or because they are afraid of being displaced in the sudden buying frenzy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You see a home go for sale and within a couple days there are three, four, six offers,'' said Carrie Miskawi, a mother of three young children who has been looking for a new home for the last six months with Mr. Colgan's help. She and her husband have decided not to put their current home on the market because they fear it will be snatched up before they have a chance to bid successfully on a new one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's kind of a Catch-22,'' Mr. Colgan said. As long as large numbers of people are hesitant to put their own homes on the market because so few other homes are available, he said, there won't be many homes available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the country, the raw number of homes for sale is at its lowest level since 1999, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. In the Sacramento metro area, home listings were down 60 percent in January from a year earlier, compared with 23 percent for the country over all, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories have been whittled down largely because new construction ground to a standstill for several years. Investors large and small have also scooped up most of the backlog of foreclosures and short sales; about 40 percent of all homes bought in Sacramento County over the last year were purchased by owners who currently live at a different address, according to county records and title data provided by the <span class="companylink">Fidelity National Title Insurance Company</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But steady job growth has put more people back to work, and families that put off moving because they couldn't afford it are finally ready to do so. ''Distressed'' sales are down and conventional sales are up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extraordinarily low mortgage rates don't hurt, either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The recovery is real,'' said John Burns, chief executive of John Burns Real Estate Consulting. ''But the pace of the recovery has an artificial component to it.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (AP) -- Builders began construction on more homes in February, and permits for future construction rose at their fastest pace since 2008. The increases point to a housing recovery that is gaining strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that builders broke ground on houses and apartments last month at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 917,000. That rate was 910,000 in January. February's pace was the second-fastest since June 2008, behind December's rate of 982,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home construction increased to an annual rate of 618,000, the most in four and half years. Apartment construction also ticked up, to 285,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gains are likely to grow even faster in the coming months. Building permits, a sign of future construction, increased 4.6 percent to 946,000. That was also the most since June 2008, just a few months into the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures for January and December were also revised upward. Housing starts have risen 28 percent over the last 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, a private report showed that the number of Americans with equity in their homes increased last year. That suggested that one of the biggest drags from the housing crisis was easing, and it could clear the way for more people to put homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The road ahead for housing is still, so far, looking promising,'' Jennifer Lee, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is recovering after stagnating for roughly five years. Steady job gains and near-record-low mortgage rates have encouraged more people to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the supply of available homes for sale remained low. That has helped push up home prices. They rose nearly 10 percent in January compared with 12 months earlier, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a research firm, the biggest increase in nearly seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher prices mean more Americans have equity in their homes. Last year, about 1.7 million Americans went from owing more on their mortgages than their homes were worth to having some ownership stake, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> reported on Tuesday. Still, 10.4 million households, or 21.5 percent of those with a mortgage, remain ''under water,'' or owe more on their home than it is worth.</p>

</div><div class="author">By JULIE SATOW </div><div>1273 words</div><div>20 March 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharon Kahen and his partner Haim Levi are making a multimillion-dollar bet on East Harlem. The developers recently closed on a vacant parcel at 119th Street and Third Avenue where they plan to build a 60-unit market-rate rental building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the next five years, we will invest $75 million to connect East Harlem to the Upper East Side,'' said Mr. Kahen, who, along with Mr. Levi, built the CL Tower at 203 East 121st Street in 2011. ''We started at 121st Street; now we are doing a project at 119th Street, and we plan to continue moving south.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand from students who attend Hunter College's newly opened Silberman School of Social Work at 119th Street, along with residents displaced by increasing rents on the Upper East Side, are driving developers to build more housing in East Harlem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the neighborhood, which runs from 96th to 142nd Streets, east of Fifth Avenue, 15 development sites traded hands in 2012, compared with just six in 2011, according to Eastern Consolidated, a commercial brokerage company. And while the number of multifamily properties that sold last year was 43, the same as in 2011, the dollar volume on the transactions increased nearly 140 percent to $287.6 million, from a little over $120 million, the company found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The neighborhood is really starting to gentrify and attract for-profit developers -- 96th Street is no longer the hard line dividing the Upper East Side and Harlem,'' said Christopher Cirillo, the executive director of Lott Community Development Corporation, which builds affordable housing. With so much competition from market-rate builders, ''there isn't a lot of property available for us to rehab or do new development, so that is really our challenge,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kahen and Mr. Levi bought their parcel on 119th Street in January. They paid about $3.8 million for the 75-foot lot, at 2183-89 Third Avenue, which also included air rights from an adjacent building. The developers plan to break ground in June and will spend $16 million to build a 12-story building of studios, one-bedrooms and two-bedrooms, as well as 5,000 square feet of commercial space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building, with a gym, a doorman and a roof deck, will have one-bedrooms starting at $2,500 a month and two-bedrooms at $2,900. In comparison, the average prices on the Upper East Side for one-bedrooms and two-bedrooms are roughly $2,400 and $3,350, according to Citi Habitats, a residential brokerage firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Land prices in East Harlem, as in all of Manhattan, have also been trending upward. The price to acquire the land for the rental building that Mr. Kahen and Mr. Levi are planning, for example, ''was about $80 a buildable square foot, and it would have been closer to $55 a foot if we had sold it back in 2011,'' said Michael A. Tortorici, a vice president for Ariel Property Advisors, the commercial brokerage firm that handled the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tortorici is marketing another development site in the neighborhood, at 336 East 112th Street, for $2.2 million. The same size lot just a few doors down, at 318 East 112th Street, sold for only $1.5 million in 2011, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to residential development, there is some commercial office construction under way in East Harlem. Artimus, a developer, is undertaking a $16 million renovation of the landmark Corn Exchange Building, on 125th Street and Park Avenue. The project, which is awaiting final approvals from the Landmarks Preservation Commission, will be one of the first new office buildings in the neighborhood in many years, said Eric S. Yarbro, a senior vice president for CBRE, a commercial brokerage firm. ''We have a $3 billion nonprofit who wants to move their offices to East Harlem, but we haven't been able to find them anything that was built after 2000,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There may also be some momentum on the 1.7 million square foot East Harlem Media, Art and Cultural Center, which is on Third Avenue from 125th to 127th Street. The project, headed by the city's Economic Development Corporation, broke ground in 2010 and was supposed to include some 385,000 square feet of retail space, 250,000 square feet of office, 840,000 square feet of residential, a hotel and a cultural center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, only 49 units of affordable housing and 6,000 square feet of retailing have been built, but developers hope to complete plans this year for the second phase, which will include residential, commercial and institutional space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This project, along with other recent investments that have been made along the 125th Street corridor, will help cement the area's place as an important cultural and retail hub for Upper Manhattan,'' said Patrick Muncie, a spokesman for the Economic Development Corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while East Harlem is seeing development, some hurdles remain. <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span> owns a large site at 1800 Park Avenue, at 124th Street, where it had planned to develop a mixed-use project before the recession. That project never materialized, and Vornado, which declined to comment, had not indicated whether it would develop the site soon. And while it seems that some progress is being made on the East Harlem Media, Entertainment and Cultural Center, the city still has not acquired all of the private parcels needed to complete the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retailing in the neighborhood is also lagging. The East River Plaza shopping center at 116th and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive has Target and <span class="companylink">Costco</span> among its tenants, ''but it hasn't transformed the neighborhood as quickly as some of us expected,'' said Lon Rubackin, a senior vice president for CBRE's retail services group. ''There are still very few national retailers in the area,'' except for fast-food tenants like Dunkin' Donuts and Subway. One reason for East Harlem's lack of national companies like the Gap or <span class="companylink">American Eagle Outfitters</span> is a dearth of retail spaces large enough to accommodate them, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, retail rents have risen since the recession, Mr. Rubackin said. He is marketing a 2,700-square-foot retail store at 116th Street and Pleasant Avenue. While the space is not large enough to attract the larger apparel companies, the asking rent of $100 a square foot is higher than a few years ago. ''After the recession, Harlem and the surrounding neighborhoods were some of the hardest hit, and rents back in 2009 or 2010 were as low as $50 a foot,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As more developers take an interest in the neighborhood, the community is doing its best to control the changes. In January, Manhattan Community Board 11 approved a proposal it developed in conjunction with the nonprofit organization Civitas to rezone 60 blocks. The plan, which has not been approved by the <span class="companylink">New York City Department of City Planning</span>, calls for several zoning changes, including greater commercial development along Park Avenue and the creation of more affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We felt the need to be extremely proactive in how our community is planned and to support growth from within,'' said Matthew S. Washington, the chairman of Community Board 11. While the rezoning cannot be done without city approvals, ''this is a way to have our voice heard and start the conversation.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharon Kahen and his partner Haim Levi are making a multimillion-dollar bet on East Harlem. The developers recently closed on a vacant parcel at 119th Street and Third Avenue where they plan to build a 60-unit market-rate rental building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In the next five years, we will invest $75 million to connect East Harlem to the Upper East Side,” said Mr. Kahen, who, along with Mr. Levi, built the CL Tower at 203 East 121st Street in 2011. “We started at 121st Street; now we are doing a project at 119th Street, and we plan to continue moving south.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand from students who attend Hunter College’s newly opened Silberman School of Social Work at 119th Street, along with residents displaced by increasing rents on the Upper East Side, are driving developers to build more housing in East Harlem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the neighborhood, which runs from 96th to 142nd Streets, east of Fifth Avenue, 15 development sites traded hands in 2012, compared with just six in 2011, according to Eastern Consolidated, a commercial brokerage company. And while the number of multifamily properties that sold last year was 43, the same as in 2011, the dollar volume on the transactions increased nearly 140 percent to $287.6 million, from a little over $120 million, the company found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The neighborhood is really starting to gentrify and attract for-profit developers — 96th Street is no longer the hard line dividing the Upper East Side and Harlem[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/manhattan/?inline=nyt-geo],” said Christopher Cirillo, the executive director of Lott Community Development Corporation, which builds affordable housing. With so much competition from market-rate builders, “there isn’t a lot of property available for us to rehab or do new development, so that is really our challenge,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kahen and Mr. Levi bought their parcel on 119th Street in January. They paid about $3.8 million for the 75-foot lot, at 2183-89 Third Avenue, which also included air rights from an adjacent building. The developers plan to break ground in June and will spend $16 million to build a 12-story building of studios, one-bedrooms and two-bedrooms, as well as 5,000 square feet of commercial space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building, with a gym, a doorman and a roof deck, will have one-bedrooms starting at $2,500 a month and two-bedrooms at $2,900. In comparison, the average prices on the Upper East Side for one-bedrooms and two-bedrooms are roughly $2,400 and $3,350, according to Citi Habitats, a residential brokerage firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Land prices in East Harlem, as in all of Manhattan[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/manhattan/?inline=nyt-geo], have also been trending upward. The price to acquire the land for the rental building that Mr. Kahen and Mr. Levi are planning, for example, “was about $80 a buildable square foot, and it would have been closer to $55 a foot if we had sold it back in 2011,” said Michael A. Tortorici, a vice president for Ariel Property Advisors, the commercial brokerage firm that handled the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tortorici is marketing another development site in the neighborhood, at 336 East 112th Street, for $2.2 million. The same size lot just a few doors down, at 318 East 112th Street, sold for only $1.5 million in 2011, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to residential development, there is some commercial office construction under way in East Harlem. Artimus, a developer, is undertaking a $16 million renovation of the landmark Corn Exchange Building, on 125th Street and Park Avenue. The project, which is awaiting final approvals from the Landmarks Preservation Commission, will be one of the first new office buildings in the neighborhood in many years, said Eric S. Yarbro, a senior vice president for CBRE, a commercial brokerage firm. “We have a $3 billion nonprofit who wants to move their offices to East Harlem, but we haven’t been able to find them anything that was built after 2000,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There may also be some momentum on the 1.7 million square foot East Harlem Media, Art and Cultural Center, which is on Third Avenue from 125th to 127th Street. The project, headed by the city’s Economic Development Corporation, broke ground in 2010 and was supposed to include some 385,000 square feet of retail space, 250,000 square feet of office, 840,000 square feet of residential, a hotel and a cultural center.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (AP) — Builders began construction on more homes in February, and permits for future construction rose at their fastest pace since 2008. The increases point to a housing recovery that is gaining strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that builders broke ground on houses and apartments last month at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 917,000. That rate was 910,000 in January. February’s pace was the second-fastest since June 2008, behind December’s rate of 982,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home construction increased to an annual rate of 618,000, the most in four and half years. Apartment construction also ticked up, to 285,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gains are likely to grow even faster in the coming months. Building permits, a sign of future construction, increased 4.6 percent to 946,000. That was also the most since June 2008, just a few months into the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures for January and December were also revised upward. Housing starts have risen 28 percent over the last 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, a private report showed that the number of Americans with equity in their homes increased last year. That suggested that one of the biggest drags from the housing crisis was easing, and it could clear the way for more people to put homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The road ahead for housing is still, so far, looking promising,” Jennifer Lee, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is recovering after stagnating for roughly five years. Steady job gains and near-record-low mortgage rates have encouraged more people to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the supply of available homes for sale remained low. That has helped push up home prices. They rose nearly 10 percent in January compared with 12 months earlier, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a research firm, the biggest increase in nearly seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher prices mean more Americans have equity in their homes. Last year, about 1.7 million Americans went from owing more on their mortgages than their homes were worth to having some ownership stake, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> reported on Tuesday. Still, 10.4 million households, or 21.5 percent of those with a mortgage, remain “under water,” or owe more on their home than it is worth.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PEOPLE who made their money by owning real estate and those who earned it in high technology would seem to have little in common. Real estate is, literally, a bricks and mortar business, and technology ventures like social media companies are pretty much the opposite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the ways that these people become wealthy -- and lose everything -- are not that far apart. In both fields, after all, the money comes from a potentially volatile asset in a cyclical industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I spoke this week to financial advisers for both groups to learn how the executives in these fields think about risk, plan for the fallow periods and make sure that their good fortune lasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the second of three columns about what we can learn from the investment behaviors, good and bad, of people in a variety of well-paid industries. Last week, I took a look at the highfliers in sports and the oil and gas business, and next week, I plan to look at doctors and lawyers, the slow but steady earners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some lessons from executives in the high-tech and real estate worlds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT ALWAYS LOOKS GREAT ON PAPER Mike PeQueen, a managing director at HighTower Las Vegas, a wealth management firm, is a Las Vegas native who resisted the city's long, strong property boom. He preferred stocks but felt, at times, as if he were the only one of his friends to believe in diversification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only now is the magnitude of their real estate losses sinking in for people who once talked about owning private jets. ''Because of the long-term nature in real estate compared to the short cycle in the stock market, they don't understand cycles exist,'' Mr. PeQueen said. ''For 25 years, Las Vegas real estate went up, and then it went down. They thought it would be a one-year down market. It's been five or six years, which is normal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. PeQueen said his clients and friends were, in the gambling parlance of the city, letting it all ride on real estate. Not only did they use properties to buy more properties, but they rarely thought of buying property elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Five real estate investments in Vegas is not diversification,'' he said. ''Any thought that they could buy rental houses in Phoenix seemed absurd. That location bias was very strong.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet this strategy did not affect all investors equally. Owners who did not take on a lot of debt have been able to hang on. But Mr. PeQueen said that many real estate investors misunderstood or ignored the concept of total return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They thought the rent was their return, and not the rent plus the continued decline in the house's value,'' he said. ''They can't imagine that they made a fortune and lost it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, concentrated investments are how most real estate investors have made their money. In New York, for example, where the value of a single office building can reach $1 billion or more, even the wealthiest families own only a handful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They have concentrated risk, but they derive comfort in that they know it so well,'' said Maureen K. Clancy, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> Wealth. ''There is a certain security that comes from that hands-on involvement.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Clancy's strategy for preserving wealth is to persuade real estate owners to put some of their money in safe investments that have nothing to do with real estate and to work with them on their level of debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Many people would assume real estate means aggressive,'' she said. ''The underpinning of their wealth is based on this shared belief that conservative leverage gives you incredible staying power.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downturns, of course, are the best time to buy properties inexpensively. And Ms. Clancy's clients, with lower leverage, have been able to undercut competitors who are struggling under greater debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEARN FROM THE PAST Many of the people in the social media world who have gotten wealthy in recent years seem to have acquired their money in the opposite way: with only a tenuous link between time spent at a company and the size of their reward. But the ones who got truly wealthy spent years wondering if their idea was going to pan out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that they have the money, they are acting more cautiously and diversifying their company stock in a way that technology developers did not in the 1990s boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the '90s, the theme was companies didn't want their employees to sell a single share of stock,'' said Mark T. Curtis, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> in Palo Alto, Calif. ''Now, I'd say among our corporate relationships, they want us to help their employees with financial education. They say, 'We've given them equity to reward them for the success of the company but help them not take all of this risk.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet because most of these companies were financed by venture capital, the backers made a lot of money. Mr. Curtis said his technology clients had a penchant for similar private deals that could just as easily go to zero as make any money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joe Goldberg, a principal at Buckingham Asset Management in St. Louis, said his firm's clients included about 50 <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> employees with wealth ranging from $500,000 to $30 million. He said some of those clients, particularly the engineers, wanted to test new ideas for companies, confident that they would be able to find another job if their venture did not work out. But, he said, that requires them to create a portfolio that avoids private deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's our job to measure that risk with their financial goals as to whether it's fiscally prudent or not,'' Mr. Goldberg said. ''Their ability to take risk with their investment portfolio may be much less because they're taking so much risk with their labor capital.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, these new millionaires are aware that they may never be able to make that kind of money again. As with the athletes I wrote about last week, many of the people working in technology are young and need the money to last a long time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the '90s, those people who got the stock thought they'd do it again,'' Mr. Curtis said. ''Now, we get brought into companies with a couple of young guys with $5 million or $10 million, and the attitude now is, 'I may or may not ever do this again. Let's make sure I don't blow it with this money.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEING CONSERVATIVE PAYS It is hard to pull back when everyone else is pushing forward. But in real estate and high technology, those who do not tie their work and investments to one company have the best chance of attaining a comfortable level of wealth. They may not get the biggest payout, but they won't lose it all either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joel Gemmell, who was employee No. 125 at <span class="companylink">Oracle</span>, said he stayed at the company in various sales roles for 25 years because other options were not as lucrative and seemed riskier. Yet, unlike some of his friends, he began selling some of his <span class="companylink">Oracle</span> stock each year and did not stop even in years when its value went up 50 or 100 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years ago, he became a wealth manager focused on high-technology sales executives, who can make several million dollars in commissions one year but not make that much again for three or four years. He spends much of his time providing reality checks when these executives propose leaving an established company to take a risk in a start-up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's very attractive for them to go to a new company and get 1 percent ownership,'' Mr. Gemmell said. ''The stars really have to be aligned for that to be worth more. I have to tell them to compare realities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And sometimes, the conservative approach in real estate means losing a little rather than a lot of money. Mr. PeQueen said he talked one of his Las Vegas clients into forfeiting a $250,000 deposit on 100 home lots in Phoenix in 2010. If the client had closed on the deal, he would have had to put up a couple million more and borrow heavily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Those lots went down considerably more'' than $250,000, Mr. PeQueen said. ''It could have destroyed him completely.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, he knew when to fold 'em.</p>
<p>Maureen K.  Clancy, a managing  director at  Barclays Wealth,  urges real estate  owners to keep  their debt down  and to put some  of their money in  safe, unrelated  investments.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some two decades ago, New York City began a huge cleanup of its downtrodden theater district, vastly improving the fortunes of the pedestrian-clogged Times Square neighborhood. In recent months, that progress has gone into high gear, with rents reaching new highs and several redevelopment projects proceeding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reflecting rising demand, asking retail rents topped $2,400 a square foot in the fourth quarter of 2012, a jump of nearly 42 percent from a year earlier and second only to rents on Fifth Avenue, according to CBRE, a commercial real estate brokerage. Ground is scheduled to be broken this year on an $800 million, 39-story hotel and retail complex at 701 Seventh Avenue, at the northern edge of Times Square, and plans for a $140 million renovation of the retail beneath the New York Marriott Marquis Times Square are also under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each day 370,000 pedestrians traipse through the Times Square bow tie, where Broadway and Seventh Avenue intersect, and each year shoppers spend $6.5 billion in the area's stores, according to the Times Square Alliance. That spending has contributed to the skyrocketing retail rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Rents in the area are approaching Fifth Avenue levels, and while a lot of this is due to the cleanup that began in the 1990s, even more is due to the massive influx of tourists over the last few years,'' said Faith Hope Consolo, chairwoman of the retail group at Douglas Elliman Real Estate. ''We expect more than 54 million this year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of such demand, developers are snatching up properties and repositioning buildings to create additional supply. One of the largest projects is at 701 Seventh Avenue, at 47th Street, where a building will be razed and replaced by 85,000 square feet of retail space and a 500-room Marriott Edition boutique hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The retail space, which will feature 25-foot glass storefronts, will be spread across the first four floors and two basement levels, and 40,000 square feet on the seventh and eighth floors will be set aside for an event space, club, several restaurants and 6,000 square feet of terraces. The building will have a 20,000-square-foot LED sign on its facade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There were plenty of people who were trying to buy this site, but they wanted to break ground immediately to capture the white-hot retail market,'' said Steven C. Witkoff, whose firm, the Witkoff Group, is a partner in the project with Howard M. Lorber's New Valley L.L.C., and the investors <span class="companylink">Winthrop Realty Trust</span> and Maefield Development. ''In our case, we felt this was a mixed-use project, and we went out and landed a hotel deal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One block south, <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span> has been leasing retail space at its building at 1540 Broadway, between 45th and 46th street. Last month, Vornado announced it had signed a deal with the Sunglass Hut at the building for $2,025 a square foot, a record for the neighborhood, Vornado said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also plans a $140 million redevelopment of the retail space across the street at 1535 Broadway, underneath the New York Marriott Marquis Times Square. The project, which would include closing the arcade that runs under the hotel, is in the planning stages. Ground is expected to be broken late this year or early next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the redevelopment, Vornado plans to create a glass facade for the stores, which will include 20,000 square feet on the ground floor and 25,000 square feet below ground, and reposition them to face Broadway. Vornado is also installing a 25,000-square-foot, 80-foot-high LED sign that will cover the Broadway face of the hotel and wrap 50 feet around each side of the building. Vornado declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Activity also is occurring along side streets. At the former headquarters of The New York Times, at 229 West 43rd Street, the landlord Africa Israel is increasing marketing efforts for the last two available retail spaces at the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last December, it paid $250,000 to <span class="companylink">JEMB Realty Corporation</span> and Aurora <span class="companylink">Capital Associates</span> to buy the lease for the former Daffy's store. JEMB and Aurora acquired a number of Daffy's leases after the discount retailer filed for bankruptcy last year. The 28,000-square-foot space opens onto West 44th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The landlord is asking $2.2 million a year for the space, which includes 1,000 square feet on the ground floor, with the rest below ground, and has a marquee and conspicuous signs. The asking rent is nearly three times the $800,000 Daffy's paid when it signed its lease in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have tremendous interest from entertainment venues for the space but nothing is signed,'' said Gary Trock, a senior vice president at CBRE who is marketing the space with Lon Rubackin, also a senior vice president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second retail space on the West 43rd Street side of the building that is vacant consists of 17,000 square feet on the ground floor and 21,000 square feet on the second floor. The landlord is considering several options for the space, including a food market similar to Eataly, Mario Batali's Italian food emporium on West 23rd Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Africa Israel bought the building in 2007 for $525 million and in 2011, sold the top 11 floors to the <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> in a $160 million office condominium deal. <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> has signed two leases totaling less than 60,000 square feet and has an additional 420,000 square feet available at the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are waiting to see how quickly <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> will lease the office space above us, since obviously we want them to lease it up, as that will help us get better terms on the retail,'' said Tamir Kazaz, chief executive of Africa Israel USA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Probably in the next two to three months we will know how to proceed, whether we want one or two destination restaurants or whether the high end food market makes more sense,'' Mr. Kazaz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New retail development is also under way at the former Roxy Deli site at 1565 Broadway, at 47th Street. The landlord Jeff Sutton, who already owns properties in the neighborhood, acquired the two-story building recently for $30 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is planning to refurbish or possibly demolish the building and replace it, and will expand the current two-story sign into a large 14-story LED sign. Mr. Sutton's Wharton Properties is also combining three buildings it owns at 1552 Broadway, 1560 Broadway and 155 West 46th Street in a $250 million deal that will create a sky lobby and additional ground floor retail. Mr. Sutton declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so much potential for retail, James B. Buslik, a principal at Adams &amp; Company, began converting many retail tenants to month-to-month leases rather than signing long-term agreements. ''Two years ago I would make 10-year leases, but now I am letting my store tenants do short-term deals to give myself the option to create something interesting when the time arises,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the retail market in Times Square is certainly the highlight, office leasing is also thriving. Deals in the Times Square submarket, bounded by West 42nd Street and West 49th, the Avenue of the Americas and Ninth Avenue, accounted for nearly 20 percent of all office leasing activity in Midtown Manhattan last year, compared with just 5.2 percent in 2011, according to Cresa New York, a brokerage for commercial tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asking rents were $63.26 a square foot in the fourth quarter of 2012, a 6 percent increase over $59.62 in the fourth quarter of 2011, according to CBRE.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mix of tenants has also shifted, as more technology companies migrate to Times Square from Midtown South. In fact, tech companies made up nearly 13 percent of the leases signed in Times Square last year, compared to just 7.4 percent in 2011, according to Cresa New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are going to see more tech and media firms moving into Times Square, especially because Midtown South has so little vacancy and tenants are looking for alternatives,'' said Jane Roundell, a senior vice president at Cresa New York.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce Bartlett[http://www.nytimes.com/ref/business/economy/bruce-bartlett-bio.html] held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of “The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform – Why We Need It and What It Will Take[http://books.simonandschuster.com/Benefit-and-The-Burden/Bruce-Bartlett/9781451646191].”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Board</span> last week released the latest data on national wealth[http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/Current/z1r-5.pdf]. Economists were gratified to see that the net worth of Americans is very nearly back — less of a tenth of 1 percent — to where it was before the 2007 crash. At the end of that year and at the end of 2012, net national wealth was just over $66.1 trillion. The rising stock and housing markets are the primary reasons, but so is the decline in debt, which is down $822 billion since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This generally good news, however, masks the fact that the benefits of rising wealth have not been equally shared. As one can see in the table, which is based on gross assets, there has been a significant change in the composition of assets. Much more is now held in the form of such financial assets as stocks and bonds and much less in nonfinancial assets, principally home equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obviously, this has important distributional implications because the average middle-class family has the bulk of its wealth tied up in its home. According to the Fed, the gross value of household real estate is $5 trillion below its precrash peak: $17.7 trillion in 2012 compared with $22.7 trillion in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Depressingly, the gross value of household real estate is up only about $1.4 trillion over the last year despite a 7.3 percent increase in home prices, according to the widely followed Case-Shiller Index[http://www.standardandpoors.com/servlet/BlobServer?blobheadername3=MDT-Type&amp;blobcol=urldocumentfile&amp;blobtable=SPComSecureDocument&amp;blobheadervalue2=inline%3B+filename%3Ddownload.pdf&amp;blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&amp;blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobheadername1=content-type&amp;blobwhere=1245347994960&amp;blobheadervalue3=abinary%3B+charset%3DUTF-8&amp;blobnocache=true]. The nation will need to do that well annually for another three years before beleaguered homeowners are back to where they were in 2006 in terms of housing wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obviously, those lucky or smart enough to be in the stock market have reaped the bulk of wealth gains. These have gone overwhelmingly to the wealthy. According to the <span class="companylink">New York University</span> economist Edward N. Wolff[http://www.nber.org/papers/w18559], corporate stock constitutes just 3.1 percent of the net wealth of the middle class (defined as the middle three wealth quintiles), excluding pension accounts, with two-thirds of their wealth in home equity. (Raw data are from the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>’s Survey of Consumer Finances[http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/aboutscf.htm].)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for the ultrawealthy (defined as the top 1 percent), home equity accounts for only 9.4 percent of their wealth, with stocks accounting for 25.4 percent. The not-quite-rich (defined as the next 19 percent of households below the top 1 percent) are also heavily invested in stocks, which constitute 14.9 percent of their wealth, with 30.1 percent in home equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These data have important macroeconomic consequences, because household wealth and its composition affect people’s work, saving and consumption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a generally accepted rule of thumb, consumers spend 3 to 5 cents from every $1 increase in wealth. Thus the $10 trillion decline in household net wealth from 2007 to 2009 took $300 billion to $500 billion in annual spending out of the economy, enough to reduce the gross domestic product by 2.1 percent to 3.5 percent in 2008 and 2009 – more than sufficient to account for the length and depth of the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But recent research suggests that the negative impact of declining wealth may even be greater because people react differently to changes in housing wealth than they do to changes in financial wealth. They also react differently to declines in wealth than they do to increases in wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest research[http://www.nber.org/papers/w18667] – by the economists Karl E. Case, John M. Quigley and Robert J. Shiller – shows a $1 decline in housing wealth reduces consumption by 10 cents per year, whereas a $1 increase in housing wealth raises spending just 3.2 cents. This suggests that homeowners will spend $500 billion less this year than they would if home prices were at their 2006 level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, changes in stock-market wealth have a much smaller effect on spending. Consumption rises or falls about 2.5 cents for each $1 change in stock market wealth. Therefore, the $4 trillion increase in financial wealth from 2011 to 2012 will add only about $100 billion to spending this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in wealth among those nearing retirement has been especially stressful, with many forced to work years longer than they planned. At the same time, there are fewer job opportunities[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/business/americans-closest-to-retirement-were-hardest-hit-by-recession.html] for those in their 50s and early 60s. This has forced many to burn through savings[http://www.aarp.org/work/job-hunting/info-09-2012/boomers-and-the-great-recession-struggling-to-recover-AARP-ppi-econ-sec.html] put aside for retirement faster than they planned, while others will need to save more to compensate for declines in asset values, which will reduce their ability spend even if the housing and stock markets continue to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in wealth may have long-lasting consequences as well, by reducing bequests[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/21/business/yourmoney/21money.html] to the next generation. Given that younger workers are already having a harder time saving and investing than their parents’ generation, in part because of crushing student debts[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/13/business/student-loans-weighing-down-a-generation-with-heavy-debt.html?pagewanted=all], the depletion of their parents’ wealth could leave many with no inheritances that might have helped fill the gap[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/26/weekinreview/26porter.html?pagewanted=all].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a rising stock market is good news, its impact is limited because few Americans own much stock. Those who have been lucky enough to benefit are increasing their spending[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323293704578334360683431902.html] and thus raising economic growth, but there aren’t enough of them. Most Americans need the housing market to rise considerably more before their finances are restored. That will be several more years, even if current positive trends continue.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOCA RATON, Fla. — Susan Shapira, who is 58, recently moved into a condominium in Century Village[http://www.centuryvillage.com/], a gated retirement community here where most residents are almost as old as the name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the nine months she has lived here, she has learned some of the drawbacks of being a baby boomer among the very old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don’t see anyone after dark,” she said. There is zero night life. The bus is often delayed — walkers slow people getting on and off. And her building’s resident representative had been hard to find after going into rehab for a back injury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Shapira says she has no regrets. She bought her two-bedroom condo for cash — $26,900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s like a car,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes it is like a used car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year a condo here sold for $7,000, according to the real estate industry’s Multiple Listing Service[http://www.mls.com/]. One in Kings Point[http://www.kingspointdelray.com/], a similar retirement community in nearby Delray Beach, sold for $3,000, according to the listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prices in these large retirement communities are not low because the properties have deteriorated since they were built in the 1970s and ’80s. In fact, they are mostly well kept.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they hold little appeal to most baby boomers, who never imagined hanging out in the same sprawling retirement complexes that attracted their parents to come here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With that World War II generation dying off and the collapse of the Florida[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/florida/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] real estate market during the recession, condominium prices in many cases are lower than they were when the units were new.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Palm Beach County property assessment records, Ms. Shapira’s condo originally sold for $40,800 in 1980. In 1990 it resold for $65,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that is not an anomaly. In 2012, the average price of a condo in Century Village of Boca Raton was $35,436. For Kings Point in Delray Beach, it was $24,436.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, at the height of the real estate boom here, the average Century Village of Boca Raton condo sold for $114,000, according to multiple listings data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Shapira, who was recently laid off from her job in the credit card industry, believes that over time she will look smart for having bought early on. “It’s a nice standard of living,” she said. “That’s how I look at it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She raised her son as a single mother, and this is the first time she has owned a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her annual property taxes are just $632.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the older generation, the men and women who came of age during the Depression and World War II, these senior communities — populated in large part by middle-class Northeasterners, often Jewish — were the Levittowns of retirement life, with thousands of condos in identical low-rise town houses offering comfortable living at affordable prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a while now, the thinking in the real estate business has been that they were a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If baby boomers did not follow their parents to the Catskills for vacations, it did not seem likely that they would retire to the same places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Barry Fogel, who sells real estate in Kings Point, says that business has picked up and that many buyers are older boomers, in their late 50s to mid-60s. “A lot of them are not thrilled about it, to be honest, but they have no choice,” Mr. Fogel said. “It’s all they can afford.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vacancy rate among the 7,200 units, he says, is under 2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there are signs that as demand picks up, prices will start to climb. In the last few months, sellers in Century Village have raised the average asking price to $50,000, up about $10,000 from last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ben G. Schachter, the president of the on-site real estate company that handles South Florida[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/great-homes-and-destinations/destinations/south-florida/index.html?inline=nyt-geo]’s six largest 55-and-older communities, said the units were not going to speculators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These are being bought by people who expect to live in them,” Mr. Schachter said. “They’re mostly buying for cash. It relieves them of having a mortgage payment as they get by on Social Security[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/social_security_us/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and fixed incomes.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The communities offer a warm-weather routine of golf, shuffleboard, swimming, nightly shows, lectures, pottery classes and exercise groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Century Village in Boca has two synagogues, though no churches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is one of four Century Villages (the others are in Deerfield Beach, Pembroke Pines and West Palm Beach). Along with Kings Point and Wynmoor Village[http://www.wynmoor.com/] in Coconut Creek, these retirement communities — the largest in South Florida — help cushion the aging process with bus service to shopping malls and doctors’ offices, as well as round-the-clock security.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One night, Ms. Shapira attended an event at the clubhouse, which includes a 1,250-seat theater, and watched as women stood on the dance floor wiggling their wrists back and forth to the music.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I guess those were the only parts that worked,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has taken advantage of the clubhouse’s fitness center, lifting weights and using a stationary bike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Handy, a 58-year-old retired state worker from New York, and his wife, Colleen, 57, a manager of a CVS drugstore, moved in three years ago, liked it and persuaded a friend to buy a unit in a nearby building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Handys have made friends with some of their elderly neighbors. When Anne Landau recently fell in her condo at 3 a.m. and could not get up, Mr. Handy went over and helped. And when Mr. Handy’s car broke down, Ms. Landau’s husband, Stanley, lent him theirs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ronny Solomon, 61, is an insurance agent from Toronto. For more than 30 years, his father, Morris, 88, has lived in Century Village in Deerfield Beach — first part time and now full time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a year ago, Ronny Solomon asked his father to scout properties, and last spring he bought a two-bedroom, two-bath unit in the same building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ronny Solomon is not ready to retire. But a strong Canadian dollar made the deal too good to resist. “You can have a property there and not worry about how you’re going to spend your retirement,” he said from Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Solomon and his wife, Susan, a salon executive, plan to spend “Yom Kippur through Passover[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/passover/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]” at their Florida condo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Eight or 10 years ago, I said I could never live there,” he said. “But you see it changing in the people on the sidewalks, on bikes, in the swimming pool — it’s in transition.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers wanting to win the highest-net worth buyers have learned that they must ''super-size'' their apartment properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past two to three years a global demand for apartments of more than 6,000 square feet, or 557 square meters, has emerged. This trend is changing the way property developers are designing their projects: just one property per floor or a single apartment on two or more floors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 12-story Opus residential tower in Hong Kong is an example, where each apartment covers an entire floor of 6,683 square feet. The building broke price records for the city within four months of its completion last year, with the unit that covers the ninth floor selling for 455 million Hong Kong dollars, or $58.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Taipei, the apartment that covers the 30th floor of the new Ellipse 360 development measures slightly more than 9,000 square feet. It has three bedrooms and glass walls offering 360-degree views, and is priced at 370 million Taiwanese dollars, or $12.46 million, with <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International</span> Reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a notable shift in the luxury segment of the market from houses to equivalent-size apartments,'' said Martin Cubbon, chief executive of Swire Properties, the Hong Kong developer behind Opus. ''This reflects a number of trends such as improved design, desire for better security, ease of maintenance and a need to be close to the heart of a city.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand is affecting development criteria in almost every major international city, though the market is being led by London and cities in North America, agents say. And properties larger than 10,000 square feet are selling fast, often at higher-than-expected prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an early indication of the trend, the New York development One57 sold 50 percent of its residences within six months of its introduction in November 2011, with the most expensive apartments selling first, including the penthouse of almost 11,000 square feet for $95 million. Buyers of apartments like that of One57 have been identified as international billionaires, and it seems every major developer is now trying to cash in on demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In London, the largest apartments at the recently renovated 3-10 Grosvenor Crescent are more than 11,000 square feet; while prime penthouses at the iconic Battersea Power Station renovation are expected to be 8,000 square feet. Several sold immediately when the project was introduced in January, for prices reported to be more than £6 million, or $9 million, each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Unit sizes are increasing because the target market wants larger, one-of-a-kind residences in key locations,'' said Peter Vaughan, director with the British architects <span class="companylink">Broadway Malyan</span>, which designed the Vauxhall Tower, a 50-story building still under construction in London. ''It's not unusual for buyers to want the top three to five floors and homes in excess of 10,000 square feet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A triplex penthouse measuring 18,000 square feet with a price tag of £50 million was reported in The Times of London to have sold to a businessman from Southeast Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even where floors at the Tower have been divided into separate two- or three-bedroom units, here too Mr. Vaughan said buyers have been requesting entire floors with more than 6,000 square feet of space. The firm is also consulting on residential projects in the Philippines, Istanbul, Georgia and Iraq in which residences exceed 5,000 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The investor demographic for large-scale penthouses includes Russians, Chinese and Middle Easterners. They often have large families, servants, or do a lot of entertaining,'' Mr. Vaughan said. ''Whereas they might previously have bought country estates, they now want to be in city centers for access to business and urban lifestyle choices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Bailey, a London-based property agent who specializes in luxury units, echoed Mr. Vaughan's comments, noting that he has seen an increase in enquiries for apartments of more than 5,000 square feet by investors from China, Russia and the Pacific Rim. He recently brokered the sale of an apartment in central London for an Australian family specifically seeking a property of more than 10,000 square feet on one floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the United States, apartments are getting larger as well as higher. The top units at 432 Park Avenue, set to be New York's tallest building when it is finished in 2015, are expected to have 8,255 square feet and sell for $82.55 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mansions at Acqualina, in Miami, has a duplex penthouse of more than 15,000 square feet that it calls a ''mansion in the sky'' with 360-degree views. It went on sale in January at $55 million; no purchase has been announced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in Toronto, the global real estate agent Christie's International Real Estate is listing a unit of 10,000 square feet, with an extra 5,000 square feet of terraces, for 28 million Canadian dollars, or $27.23 million in the Cumberland, a restored 1960s building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend for more space also is gaining ground in traditional second-home markets. In the Swiss ski resort of Andermatt, the Chedi Residences has a duplex with 620 square meters of living space. The property is the biggest penthouse for sale to foreigners in Switzerland that also is exempt from a law that restricts second homes owned by non-nationals to 200 square meters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christof Birkhofer, head of real estate at Andermatt Swiss Alps, which is marketing the project, said high-end buyers look for apartments with long-term investment potential, as well as space and hotel-style facilities. ''Premium properties are stable in price even during hard times,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Portico, a new project of luxury apartments in Barbados, has also been designed to appeal to the high-end second home market. A seafront ''mega-apartment'' of 10,000 square feet is available, at $9 million, through <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sixty percent of Portico is now sold and some buyers, which include Canadians, French and Italians, have already combined smaller units to create apartments in excess of 7,000 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, this sector may not be as buoyant as expected, according to Tancred Lidbury, sales director with Christie's International Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Buyers typically want large lateral or duplex apartments in blue-chip cities, such as Paris, London, Hong Kong and New York,'' he said. ''Developers are trying to recreate the same market in traditional second-home destinations, such as the Caribbean, but there is less take-up for such large homes in those locations. Clients trying to sell super-size homes in these regions can find it tough.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And developers are continuing to build big. Sales in the Shard, a new tower in London, have not begun yet but it has been reported that there will be residential units of around 30,000 square feet. Equally newsworthy is Tour Odéon, in Monte Carlo. The tower, which is being built to 49 stories, is to have a world-beating penthouse of 3,300 square meters, or 35,500 square feet.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doctors, social agencies and community groups that have long been frustrated by the inability to alleviate environmental conditions that contribute to ailments like heart disease and obesity are promoting the idea that a shift in land-use planning and design can stanch some of the harmful influences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept is being put to one of its earliest and biggest tests in the La Alma/Lincoln Park neighborhood near downtown Denver. That's where the city's housing authority used a relatively new decision-making tool known as a health impact assessment to draft a redevelopment plan that encourages physical activity and environmental sustainability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that end, the redevelopment of buildings in the 17-acre project, known as Mariposa, will incorporate ecologically advanced construction materials and practices, and a combination of geothermal and solar power will generate up to 60 percent of the development's energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents will also find naturally lighted and centrally located staircases enticing them away from the elevators, as well as neighborhood gardens to encourage a better diet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As we talked to residents, we began to learn from their perspective that having new housing would be great, but that it alone wouldn't improve their quality of life or create a path to success or sustainability for them,'' said Ismael Guerrero, executive director of the Denver Housing Authority. ''So we came at this from the point of view of, How are we going to transform this neighborhood into a healthy, vibrant community?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocates of health impact assessments hope that Mariposa will convince more developers to use the tool, which examines environmental, economic and social influences on health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While communities and other organization have conducted these types of assessments in road construction, energy developments and other projects, the studies are also ideally suited to guide transit-oriented developments, infrastructure improvements and urban redevelopment in low-income neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health impact assessments have been a mainstay in Europe and other countries for several years, but proponents say they did not appear in the United States until 1999. Now some 200 of these assessments have been completed or are under way here, up from 50 four years ago, said Dr. Aaron Wernham, project director for the Health Impact Project, a collaboration of the <span class="companylink">Robert Wood Johnson Foundation</span> and Pew Charitable Trusts that helps finance health impact assessments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People in the public health world and in the business and development world are waking up to the need to get at health care problems and bring down health care costs,'' he said. ''So we see a fair amount of uptake in certain sectors -- the health impact assessment is out there and growing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A typical assessment comprises six steps that primarily identify a project's potential health impacts and ways to mitigate them. Community interaction is crucial to the process. In 2009, Mariposa's assessment by Mithun, an architectural firm, and other organizations, included more than 140 community meetings, held 12 steering committee meetings, and received more than 550 comments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Erin Christensen, an associate principal at Mithun, points to a nine-year-old affordable housing project in Seattle that already can show a link between design and health. The community suffered from a high rate of asthma, and working with the <span class="companylink">Seattle Housing Authority</span> and others, Mithun called on medical research to create about 60 ''Breathe Easy Homes.'' The homes feature hard floors instead of carpeting, high efficiency air filters and low-allergen landscaping, among other elements aimed at reducing asthma triggers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study in 2010 performed by the University of Washington School of Public Health found that the Breathe Easy residents had reduced emergency room and urgent care visits by 67 percent and that symptom-free days had increased by 61 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As designers, that was the first time that we had really seen a direct relationship shown between the built environment and the health of residents,'' Ms. Christensen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working on Mariposa gave Mithun the opportunity to take a more ''comprehensive and holistic'' approach by integrating a health impact assessment into the design process for the first time, she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among other issues, Mariposa's assessment found that more than 55 percent of the neighborhood's predominantly Latino residents were overweight, about 75 percent had high blood pressure or were borderline, and nearly 40 percent had a condition that prevented them from working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Guerrero said the plan for Mariposa is largely geared toward attracting private investment to the neighborhood, which is one of the city's oldest, nestled near a light rail station, a higher education campus and the popular Art District on Santa Fe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To accomplish that, the authority is replacing 250 affordable housing units with 800 mixed-income rental and for-sale units slated for completion in 2018. It has constructed 100 units of senior housing, and this year it plans to complete another 190 units that will be a mix of affordable, work force and market-rate rental apartments, and town homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average income in the neighborhood is around $11,000 a year, Mr. Guerrero said, and he hopes that the project will attract people earning $30,000 to $100,000 annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To date, the notion that living and economic conditions can influence health has mostly dominated public project and policy decisions. Private developers are probably not very familiar with health impact assessments, said Patrick L. Phillips, the chief executive of the Urban Land Institute. But that's about to change, he predicted. The institute is about six months away from introducing a major initiative focusing on ways to improve health through the built environment. ''What has struck us is how quickly these assessments have emerged as a public concern sufficient to be incorporated within the traditional land-use decision-making regulatory framework,'' Mr. Phillips said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, a push to widen the use of health impact assessments in real estate developments could run into obstacles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now assessments are largely voluntary, though some federal and state lawmakers have made efforts to mandate them, said Jonathan Heller, co-founder of Human Impact Partners, an Oakland, Calif., company that conducts health impact assessments and trains others to perform them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Heller and other assessment advocates anticipate that private developers will see the tool simply as a cost-adding measure or a way for community activists to stall or stop proposed projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Douglas R. Bigley, the chief executive of Urban Housing Communities, a developer based in Santa Ana, Calif, has embraced the assessments. In addition to building affordable housing, the commercial developer also tries to provide services that a neighborhood lacks. He said that the collaborative nature of health impact assessments can reveal information that would alter building and design plans. If an assessment showed that residents lack access to health care, for example, Urban Housing might create a community room designed to accommodate occasional visits from mobile clinics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We use the health impact assessments to reach out to the community to figure out what the surroundings really look like,'' Mr. Bigley said. ''The more issues we're aware of, the more we can do to sculpt a development to meet the needs of the neighborhood.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate prices in the heart of New Delhi, especially for bungalows built nearly a century ago during the British Raj, are among the highest in the world; though India's economy has cooled, the demand for property in elite areas remains so strong that even finding a house for sale is tricky, as formal listings do not exist; prices usually circulate by word of mouth; transactions often require some 'black' money, or stacks of cash paid under the table to avoid taxes.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW DELHI — The fading bungalow at 38 Amrita Shergil Marg does not immediately shout real estate bling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no tennis court, no infinity pool, no Sub-Zero refrigerator or walk-in closet. The paint is chipped, the bathrooms are musty and the ceilings have water stains. The house may ultimately be torn down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet when it went up for public auction, the winning bid was almost $29 million. And many neighbors consider that a bargain. One block away, a gracious if not quite Rockefeller-ready residence once leased by the Mexican ambassador is now reportedly on the market for more than $100 million. Other nearby houses are going for $40 million to $70 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The price of the Mexican residence is $110 million,” said Jorge Roza de Oliveira, Portugal’s ambassador to India[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/india/index.html?inline=nyt-geo]. “You can buy a home in New York and Miami and Lisbon and London and keep a lot of change for that much.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate prices in the heart of New Delhi, especially for the bungalows built nearly a century ago during the British Raj[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/independence1947_01.shtml], are among the highest in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though India’s economy has cooled, the demand for property in elite areas remains so strong that even finding a house for sale is tricky: formal listings do not exist; prices usually circulate by word of mouth. Transactions often require some “black” money, or stacks of cash paid under the table to avoid taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyers are often Indian industrialists looking for a trophy property, a real estate Rolex. Or, real estate agents and sellers say, they can be politicians or their proxies, who often pay with trunks of cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For their money, buyers get a lovely piece of land and a piece of history, if not much in the way of amenities. Many houses require a major overhaul. Services, if far better in these elite areas, are still inadequate: drinking the tap water is not advised, and power failures remain an irritant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The obvious question about the prices, in a country where hundreds of millions of people still live on less than $2 a day, is: Why?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To a large degree, India is experiencing the sort of real estate boom common to big, emerging economies. When Japan’s economy was soaring in the 1980s, prices in Tokyo were so frothy that the 845-acre compound of the Imperial Palace was valued at more than all the real estate in California[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-30640132/japans-palace-grounds-once-more-valuable-than-california/]. More recently, China has seen a boom, with real estate values rising in some cities by 500 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the spike in New Delhi is also being fueled by ego, status and some unique distortions in India’s economy. Few properties come available in the leafiest, most prestigious section of the capital, known as Lutyens’ Delhi[http://www.departures.com/articles/delhi-lutyens-delhi], because the area is mostly dedicated to government housing. Powerful government ministers live in British-era bungalows with stately lawns of several acres, while lesser officials are eligible for different categories of government housing in an oasis largely separated from the rest of the chaotic capital, where many people live crowded into slums or shanties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is the best part of Delhi, the core of Delhi,” said Munish Kumar Garg, who oversees the allocation of government housing. “If these properties in Lutyens’ Delhi were put on sale, there would be a queue two kilometers long.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Garg, the director of the government’s Directorate of Estates[http://estates.nic.in/estates.aspx], controls one of the more valuable residential real estate portfolios in the world. Asked how many New Delhi properties fell under his agency, he shrugged. “It would be difficult to know,” he said. “Maybe 10,000.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a British architect, Edwin Lutyens, who in the early 1900s designed what is now the governmental heart of the capital. Beyond the grand buildings erected as the seat of British imperial power, Mr. Lutyens and other architects also built a residential bungalow zone of whitewashed single-story homes surrounded by verdant gardens. When India won its independence in 1947, the British moved out of many of the houses and the Indians moved in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, power in Delhi can be measured by where a politician lives. The Directorate of Estates divides properties into eight categories, with Category 8 bungalows, the most exclusive, reserved for ministers and other top leaders. Former prime ministers and presidents, and their spouses, are allowed to remain in Category 8 housing until death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the shortage of such housing, the recent death of former Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral has spurred jockeying over who will get the bungalow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Navin Chawla, who was India’s chief election commissioner from 2005 to 2010, lived with his wife in a Category 8 bungalow on six acres, with accommodation for 17 servants, including a separate house most likely worth many millions of dollars. When his term ended, so did his tenancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have to tell you, these homes are very timeless,” he said, sounding wistful. “It’s a bonus of the job to get a six-acre property for five years, one of the few bonuses of being election commissioner, I can tell you.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, as Indian industrialists have amassed great fortunes in recent years, the temptation to buy into a zone where status is so nakedly demarcated and only a few hundred private properties exist has proved irresistible. Property values in the Lutyens’ bungalow zone, as well as in nearby neighborhoods, have appreciated steadily for many years but skyrocketed in the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, families have held these private houses for generations. Many were refugees from Pakistan after partition in 1947, when streets like Amrita Shergil Marg were hardly exclusive. Veena Kumar’s parents arrived almost penniless in 1947 and rented a bungalow on the street for about $5.50 a month, before buying it eight years later. In those days, the house was at the southern rim of the city, beside what is now Lodi Garden, which is known as the city’s most beautiful park but seemed like jungle back then. Longtime neighbors recall hearing the cry of hyenas at night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the house lies in the heart of the city and Ms. Kumar and her sister are looking to sell. Ms. Kumar declined to discuss her asking price, but local media reported it as about $55 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“One cannot afford these taxes,” she said, explaining that the upkeep and property taxes had pushed her to sell. “It is very expensive.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wild prices have also affected the rental market. For decades, owners happily rented to ambassadors or diplomatic missions. Now, rents have jumped so sharply that some ambassadors are moving. Mr. Oliveira, the Portuguese ambassador, recently relocated after his rent soared. Mexican ambassadors had lived at 13 Prithviraj Road — the house priced at $110 million — for a half-century, with the original lease signed by Octavio Paz[http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1990/paz-bio.html], the Nobel Prize[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/nobel_prizes/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]-winning writer and poet who was Mexico’s ambassador in the 1960s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(The United States Embassy is a beneficiary of the rising real estate values, because for several decades it has owned several residential properties in elite areas.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rahul Rewal, a local real estate agent, said that demand was pushing up prices all over the capital region and that the Lutyens’ zone actually was a safe investment, since values keep going up, partly because so few places come onto the market. Fifteen years ago, the telecommunications magnate Sunil Mittal paid about $6.6 million for a property on Amrita Shergil Marg that he razed and rebuilt. At the time, the price was astonishing; today, it would be a bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mittal’s brother, Rajan, was the winner of the auction for 38 Amrita Shergil Marg. The property had been entangled in a family legal feud for three decades until a judge ordered that the property be sold at auction, with the proceeds divided among family members. Had it been sold privately, many neighbors and brokers say, the final price would have been higher. To avoid taxes, many sellers demand huge, secret cash payments to supplement the publicly recorded selling price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even now, the owners are still bickering. G. K. Gupta lives in the front half of the house, while his nephew Shivraj Gupta lives with his family in the back half. The uncle is in favor of the sale, but the nephew says he is still challenging it in court. And though both would be wildly rich when the sale is completed, the elder Mr. Gupta said that kind of money only goes so far in New Delhi.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite less-than-rhapsodic memories of miniaturized apartment living, the married architects Mimi Hoang and Eric Bunge designed the winner of the adAPT micro-unit competition sponsored by the New York City Housing and Preservation Department and endorsed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their entry, ''My Micro NY,'' features 55 prefabricated apartments, of 360 square feet or less, stacked in a 10-story building on East 27th Street in Kips Bay. The building does not stint on amenities, providing a common terrace, a laundry room and a bike room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple's firm, nArchitects, is based in a Dumbo loft, and they live in a Carroll Gardens town house, but for the competition they drew on their cohabitation in a tenement in Lower Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission was to seize an opportunity to render a tight space habitable and, if possible, aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At first blush we weren't so sure about entering,'' Mr. Bunge said, ''because we felt people should have more space than this. But that was before we understood that the alternatives out there are far worse. There are people living together in substandard apartments all over the city who would prefer to live alone but can't afford to. So we said, 'Wait a minute, let's make a humane small space where people would want to live.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The architects say the design is flexible and transferable to virtually any neighborhood or borough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a pilot program, and it doesn't mean micro-units are going to be sprouting everywhere,'' Ms. Hoang said. ''But it's incredibly exciting to be part of a progressive new residential prototype for New York that has social implications and is intended to help solve a social problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is not a return to tenement or S.R.O.-style living,'' she added. ''There are amenities and a very social dimension to the design.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The target tenants are singles, who constitute nearly a third of the city's households, and couples with a limited income. Forty percent of the units are designated as affordable housing, with rents that start at $914 a month and top out at $1,873.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And no, combination units are not on the horizon: ''One of our friends, an artist, told us he wanted to buy three of the units and combine them,'' Mr. Bunge said, ''and after we got done laughing, we told him first of all, these are rentals, and second, combining them would totally defeat the entire purpose.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The objective of the contest, undertaken by 33 design teams (nArchitects partnered with Monadnock Development and the Actors Fund Housing Development Corporation), was to design affordable, appealing apartments in the 250- to 350- square-foot range. Construction on the $15 million building, envisioned by the architects in four shades of gray brick, will start by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The units the couple designed for ''My Micro NY'' are being built at a factory in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The layouts vary (though the kitchens and baths are identical), but all offer several surprising features: a nine-foot-high sliding glass door that opens onto a Juliet balcony, ceilings nearly 10 feet in height, a full closet and 16 linear feet of built-in overhead storage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're going to be miles better than the apartment we used to live in,'' Mr. Bunge said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nick Lembo, the president of Monadnock, recruited nArchitects for the competition. ''Some architects shy away from modular construction, and some are intimidated by micro-units,'' he said. ''But Mimi and Eric were excited by the creative challenges. They created an incredibly space-efficient unit with an open design that will make it feel larger than its square footage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Ms. Hoang put it: ''We imagined a building that could become a New York housing model -- make a big impact with small rooms. The repercussions on the housing market could be broad, and that's thrilling for us. Not lucrative, but thrilling.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hoang, 41, and Mr. Bunge, 45, are thin people, of average height and not overly fond of furniture -- they are capable, in other words, of functioning in a relatively small residential footprint -- but they recall their five years in a 350-square-foot hovel in the East Village with minimal nostalgia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the sort of place, Mr. Bunge said, where you morphed your body into a pretzel to negotiate the splinter of space separating the bathroom sink from the toilet and the door. A dungeonlike ambience closed in like an unwanted embrace the moment one entered the building, and it failed to improve inside the three remarkably paltry rooms, which cost them $1,200 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It had absolutely no amenities,'' Ms. Hoang recalled, ''except for the neighborhood and the fact that it was rent-controlled.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they were recent newlyweds (married in 1998), and they made a mutual decision to leave their 1,400-square-foot rental loft in Boston. Both had received master's degrees in architecture from Harvard, and their goal was to get jobs, save money and establish their own firm. So the price was right, even if the tenement was a downer. With no room for their books, they stashed them in a rented storage unit in Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 1999 they had started nArchitects, which today employs 11 people. In 2004 they won <span class="companylink">the Museum of Modern Art</span>'s Young Architects Program with ''Canopy,'' a felicitous and sinuous outdoor installation of green bamboo on MoMA's P.S. 1 campus in Long Island City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They landed their first residential project, the seven-story Switch Building at 109 Norfolk Street, in late 2004 and completed it in 2007. Here, they designed four 1,400-square-foot floor-through apartments, a 2,000-square-foot penthouse, and a ground-floor art gallery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barry Bergdoll, the chief curator of architecture and design at MoMA, was on a committee that reviewed the entries for the adAPT competition, which were submitted without names attached. The winner was announced in late January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Theirs was by far my favorite,'' he said, ''so it was a pleasant surprise when I found the winning entry was Mimi and Eric's, because we've been watching their progress ever since 2004. It is so astutely and sensitively thought out, with a maximization of storage potential in a minimal space; it really looks like how a person might actually live.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the New York City Parks and Recreation Department, they designed the Wyckoff House Museum, a 5,000-square-foot education complex destined for Wyckoff Park in East Flatbush, Brooklyn. On the commercial side, they just completed the redesign and expansion of the retail landmark in Beirut, Lebanon, known as ABC Mall, for which they created a laser-cut aluminum facade. They are also on the team headed by James Corner Field Operations (landscape architect for the High Line) that won the competition for an $85 million redesign of Chicago's Navy Pier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They are members of a new and conscientious generation of architects and they are definitely a firm to watch,'' said the architect Robert A. M. Stern, the dean of the Yale School of Architecture, where Ms. Hoang teaches design. ''It's not about making pretty pictures. It's about design integrity and the ability to articulate ideas and make them livable to real people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About the micro-units and the Switch Building, with its bay-window motif, Mr. Stern said, ''It's what I would call smart design.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their most recent residential renovation is their house in Brooklyn, a 1901 structure they transformed from a three-unit rental to a 2,100-square-foot single-family residence for themselves and their two sons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They still don't have much furniture, but their entire book collection fits right in.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (AP) — Orders for factory goods that signal business investment plans jumped last month by the most in more than a year, suggesting companies were confident about their business prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that orders for so-called core capital goods, which include industrial machinery, construction equipment and computers, rose 6.3 percent in January from December. A sharp drop in demand for commercial aircraft caused overall orders for durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, to fall 5.2 percent, the first decline since August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for commercial aircraft are volatile from month to month and can cause large swings in the overall figure. <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> reported orders for only two planes in January, down from 183 in December. Orders for military equipment also plummeted by the most in more than 12 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in core capital goods suggests companies are willing to expand their production capacities despite worries that automatic government spending cuts will slow the economy in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The fact remains that capital spending appears to be holding up very well,” said Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG, a brokerage firm. “In fact, it appears to be accelerating.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the jump in orders was not broad based and occurred mostly in machinery and manufactured metal products. Orders for computers and communications equipment both fell, and orders for autos and auto parts were unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And even with the increase, orders have mostly just recovered last year’s losses. Total core capital goods orders reached $67.7 billion in January, just above December 2011’s level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several economists warned that orders were likely to fall in the coming months after such a big gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We don’t expect businesses suddenly to throw caution to the wind,” Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About $85 billion in spending cuts are scheduled to begin on Friday, and there is little sign that the White House and Congress will reach a deal to avoid them. Defense Department officials may have slowed purchases in January in anticipation of the cutbacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business investment plans have held up in recent months despite the uncertainty surrounding tax and spending policies. Core capital goods orders dipped 0.3 percent in December but posted strong gains of 3.3 percent in November and 3 percent in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, a measure of the number of Americans who signed contracts to buy homes rose in January from December to the highest level in more than two and a half years. The increase suggests sales of previously occupied homes will continue rising in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Wednesday that its seasonally adjusted index for pending home sales rose 4.5 percent last month to 105.9 — the highest level since April 2010, when a homebuyer’s tax credit was about to expire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is generally a one- to two-month lag between a signed contract and a completed sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales rose in all regions, but just barely ticked up in the West, where a limited supply of available homes was holding sales back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase was the latest positive report for the housing market, which began recovering last year after a deep, six-year slump.</p>

</div><div class="author">By PETER LATTMAN </div><div>731 words</div><div>26 February 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October 2010, the hedge fund manager David Einhorn took the stage at an investor conference and announced a large bet against the <span class="companylink">St. Joe Company</span>, a large owner of Florida real estate. He walked through a presentation titled ''Field of Schemes: If You Build It, They Won't Come,'' laying out his case that St. Joe vastly overvalued its property holdings. The company's stock promptly plummeted 20 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aggrieved shareholders sued the company, saying they were blindsided by the assessment. They accused St. Joe's of securities fraud based on the revelations in Mr. Einhorn's critique.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta threw out the case, ruling that the shareholders could not rely on Mr. Einhorn's report in bringing a fraud claim against the company. The court said that his presentation merely repackaged information that was already public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Einhorn was a maven of Wall Street,'' said Judge Charles R. Wilson, who wrote the opinion for the three-judge panel. ''It is no great surprise that investors might flee like rats from a sinking ship upon news that he viewed a stock's prospects as grim.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Einhorn, who runs <span class="companylink">Greenlight Capital</span>, has made a name for himself with his aggressive bets against companies, including <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> before the bank collapsed, and <span class="companylink">Green Mountain Coffee Roasters</span>. As he has gained acclaim, so has his ability to move stock prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is part of a generation of stock pickers that has taken an increasingly activist stance, using investor conferences, or cable television, to publicize their views about companies. The investor William A. Ackman has recently made waves claiming that Herbalife, the supplements marketer, is a fraud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest appeals court ruling will most likely make it harder for shareholders to base fraud claims on an analyst's report or a short-seller's opinion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The court got it exactly right,'' said Sharon Nelles, a lawyer at <span class="companylink">Sullivan &amp; Cromwell</span> who represented St. Joe. ''The opinion of a short-seller that he has made a good bet is not a basis for a shareholder fraud complaint.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Einhorn made headlines last week after winning an unrelated court ruling against Apple that was part of his campaign to get the tech giant to distribute more of its cash to investors. (Mr. Einhorn owns Apple shares outright, so he is hoping that the stock, which is down about 37 percent from its 52-week highs, will rise in value).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of St. Joe, Mr. Einhorn spoke at the Value Investing Congress in Manhattan in 2010 and said that the company had vastly overstated the worth of its real estate holdings, which included about 570,000 acres of land, much of it in the Florida panhandle. His 139-page slide presentation showed empty lots, half-built houses and vacant storefronts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a ghost town,'' he said of one abandoned development at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few months after Mr. Einhorn's presentation, St. Joe disclosed in a public filing that the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> had initiated an inquiry into St. Joe's valuation policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">St. Joe shareholders, led by the City of Southfield Fire and Police Retirement System in Michigan, sued the company. They claimed that the information in Mr. Einhorn's report and the disclosure about the S.E.C. inquiry should have been previously revealed. The trial court threw out the lawsuit, and the appeals court affirmed that action on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The court said that ''Einhorn's opinion revealed no fact to the market'' and nothing suggested that St. Joe ''obfuscated or concealed the information on which Einhorn relied.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the disclosure of the S.E.C. inquiry, the court said that it alone was not an actionable securities fraud claim. ''The announcement of an investigation reveals just that -- an investigation -- and nothing more,'' the court said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">St. Joe disputed Mr. Einhorn's claims, though it eventually wrote down the value of some of its assets. The S.E.C. never brought any action against the company, whose share price has recovered to about where it was on the day of Mr. Einhorn's presentation.</p>
