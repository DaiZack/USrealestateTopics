<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the housing bubble, prices rose beyond all reason. In the bust, they fell even more than they had risen. For a long time since then, they recovered in fits and starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, however -- as is fitting in a saner real estate market -- house prices have been rising in line with personal income and other economic fundamentals in local areas. But a return to a more stable growth pattern does not mean that housing will once again become the economic engine it was in the decades before the bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason is that millions of homeowners still owe hundreds of billions of dollars more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. Those borrowers tend to live in areas that were hard hit in the bust and still have weak economies, a mix that makes it nearly impossible to outgrow earlier losses. Their plight hurts the broader economy, because underwater homeowners are less likely to spend, relocate or build wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One solution for many troubled borrowers would be to modify their loan terms. But as Gretchen Morgenson of The Times reported recently, banks are still unwilling to modify loans, despite rules imposed by regulators and legal settlements after the bust that were supposed to make it easier and fairer for borrowers to obtain relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The banks say they have broken no rules. But lawyers for borrowers, as well as a new report by the inspector general of the government's main housing debt-relief program, indicate otherwise. In particular, it appears that banks are still able to make more money by delaying or denying modifications -- and thereby earning more fees and interest -- than by granting new loan terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason that housing cannot propel the economy the way it once did is the growing inequality in incomes. That home prices are increasing in tandem with income is a sign of stability. But only investment income has been rising steadily in the recovery, while wages from work have stagnated. One result is that buying a home is still out of reach for many working people, particularly those who would have been first-time buyers in a healthier economy. Another result is that builders have largely focused on higher-end homes, leading to a low inventory of new starter homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation is evidence of the unrepaired damage from the bust. Aggressive intervention to provide debt relief and create good jobs is still needed, but has not been forthcoming. It is not too late for remedial steps, if only the political consensus to take them could be found.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The number of signed contracts to buy homes fell in June, as limited supplies of homes on the market held back possible sales growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday that its seasonally adjusted pending home sales index declined 1.8 percent, to 110.3, last month. Still, strong demand from would-be buyers has pushed the index up 8.2 percent in the last 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We could see a bit of a slowing in the recent upward trend in existing-home sales in the coming months,'' said Derek Lindsey, an analyst at the bank <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solid hiring and relatively low mortgage rates have propelled the previous five months of gains in the pending sales index. But buying options are increasingly limited because the market contains just five months' supply of homes, compared with the historical average of six months in a healthier market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales are a barometer of future purchases. A lag of a month or two usually exists between a contract and a completed sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline indicates that sales may soon be peaking after steady growth for much of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Completed sales of existing homes climbed 3.2 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49 million, the highest rate since February 2007, the Realtors group said last week. These sales have climbed 9.6 percent over the last 12 months, although the number of existing homes available to buy has edged up a slim 0.4 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One result of strong demand and limited supplies is increasing prices, which can eventually hurt affordability and cause would-be buyers to pull back from the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price has risen 6.5 percent over the last year to $236,400, the highest level -- unadjusted for inflation -- reported by the Realtors group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of that demand has stemmed from an accelerated pace of hiring that dates to early 2014. Employers added 3.1 million jobs last year and are on pace to add 2.5 million this year. Those new jobs have filled the economy with new paychecks that stirred more interest in home buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low but rising mortgage rates also increased buyer demand.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American consumers' confidence in July took its biggest tumble in four years on a less upbeat jobs outlook. Home appreciation in major cities stalled in May, suggesting a spring pause in housing demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disappointing information comes as <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> policy makers meet Tuesday and Wednesday to consider whether the economy is strong enough to warrant ending the Fed's near-zero interest rate policy, perhaps in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>, an industry group, said on Tuesday that its index of consumer attitudes fell to 90.9 this month from a downwardly revised 99.8 in June. It fell far short of a forecast reading of 100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest figure was the lowest since September 2014, and the decline was the steepest since August 2011. The report's jobs hard-to-get index rose to 26.7 from an upwardly adjusted 26.1 for June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ryan Sweet, senior economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics in West Chester, Pa., said the slump in confidence probably reflected recent upheavals in the global economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This seems to be an aberration,'' he said. ''Consumers were probably freaked out by the problems in Greece and the Chinese stock market, and the volatility on Wall Street.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller composite home price index of 20 metropolitan areas rose 4.9 percent year over year in May, matching the pace in April. Economists polled by Reuters had projected a 5.6 percent increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index covers roughly half of American homes, measures prices compared with those in January 2000 and creates a three-month moving average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As home prices continue rising, they are sending more upbeat signals than other housing market indicators,'' David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span><span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> Indices, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He called first-time home buyers ''the weak spot'' for the price plateau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said other indicators showed continuing improvement in the housing and job sectors, which would allow the Fed's policy makers to consider normalizing interest rates from the emergency low level it adopted in December 2008 in the global financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As long as the general tone of the data shows improvement and inflation is moving toward its 2 percent target, they will feel comfortable to raise rates in September,'' Mr. Sweet said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have been climbing. They have risen 27 percent across the United States since 2012, even more in places like San Francisco. But why worry? If you accept the efficient markets theory — and believe that real estate is an efficient market — then these prices are based on ‘‘new information,’’ even if you don’t know what that information is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem with this kind of thinking is that the efficient markets theory is at best a half-truth, as a voluminous literature on market anomalies shows. What’s more, even that half-truth is grounded mainly in the stock market, which attracts professional investors who sometimes do make the market behave efficiently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is another matter. It is far less rational than even the often irrational stock market, for a couple of important reasons. First, most investors find it difficult to understand how housing supply responds to changes in demand. Only a small minority of people think carefully about such things. Second, it is very hard for the minority of smart-money investors who do understand such matters to bet against bubble-level prices in real estate markets. In housing, the smart money has relatively little voice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first point, in ‘‘A Nation of Gamblers: Real Estate Speculation and American History,’’ a presentation at the 2013 <span class="companylink">American Economic Association</span> convention, Edward L. Glaeser of <span class="companylink">Harvard University</span> reviewed real estate booms and busts. He showed how real estate investors have repeatedly made the mistake of neglecting the supply response to rising prices. In the Alabama cotton farmland boom of 1815 to 1819, for example, high cotton prices seemed to justify high prices for cotton land. What most investors failed to see at the time was that these cotton prices would induce new farmers around the world to begin to grow cotton. That same failure to anticipate how supply can respond to demand applies to many forms of real estate today. Developers and builders will, one way or another, exploit overpricing, increasing effective supply, in that way bringing real estate prices down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the second point, in 1977 Edward M. Miller pointed out in The Journal of Finance something that should have been obvious: Efficient markets require the possibility of selling short. In the stock market, for example, with short-selling, people who think the market is overpriced and headed for a fall can borrow shares and sell the borrowed shares at the current high price. If share prices do indeed fall, they can buy the shares back at a lower price and repay the loan, with a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short-selling helps prevent bubbles from forming, but such negative bets cannot easily occur in the housing market. You can’t routinely borrow a house and sell it, promising to buy back the same house later to repay the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets without the possibility of making these negative bets will be inefficient. That’s because if it is not possible to short, the smart money can do no more than avoid holding an overpriced asset. Without short-sellers, there is nothing to stop a group of ignorant investors from bidding up prices to extravagant levels. In the housing market, that poses an enormous problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suppose that you are convinced housing prices are too high. How can you profit from this insight? You might consider shorting the residential real estate investment trusts (REITs) that invest in residential properties and are themselves traded on stock exchanges. However, REIT prices do not have a consistent correlation with housing prices, and tend to resemble stock prices instead. For example, the housing market declined in the two years after the March 2009 bottom of the stock market. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span>/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index fell 6 percent over this period. But, over that same time interval, the S.&amp;P. 500 Residential REIT index tripled in value. Clearly, shorting this index would have been a bad move, even though a bet that housing prices would decline was spot on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the financial crisis, some professional investors did manage to profit by correctly forecasting home price declines. They used mortgage derivatives such as collateralized debt obligations to place their bets. John Paulson of <span class="companylink">Paulson &amp; Company</span> is well known for very successfully profiting from his prediction of trouble in the housing market. But mortgages are not homes, and he and others like him did not beat down the emerging housing bubble before it grew out of proportion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a way for smart money to profit from an understanding of high prices. It is to build new houses and sell them before prices fall. This is a time-consuming process, but it is what we are starting to see now, as housing starts and permits data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, despite rising prices, at present, exuberant investors do not dominate the domestic housing market over all. The Pulsenomics survey of household heads in January showed that national home price expectations are modest: On average, increases of only 3.7 percent a year are expected for the next 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extravagant expectations do lurk in parts of the market. In the 2015 Yale School of Management survey of recent home buyers that Karl Case of <span class="companylink">Wellesley College</span>, Anne Thompson of Dodge Data &amp; Analytics and I direct, our preliminary results confirmed the overall Pulsenomics conclusion, yet found that some people had strikingly unrealistic expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Francisco, for example, we found that while the median expectation for annual home price increases over the next 10 years was only 5 percent, a quarter of the respondents said they thought prices would increase each year by 10 percent or more. That would mean a net 150 percent increase in a decade. These people are apparently not thinking about the supply response that so big a price increase would generate. People like this could bid prices in some places so high that eventually the local market would collapse. Yet the smart money can’t find a profitable way to correct such errors today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bottom line is that there is no reason to assume that the real estate market is even close to efficient. You may want to buy a house if you love it and can afford it. But remember that you cannot safely rely on ‘‘comparable sales’’ to judge that the price is fair. The market isn’t efficient enough for that.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer Confidence Report</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>, an independent business membership and research association, will report on consumer confidence in July. After a surge in June, a mild drop in consumer attitudes was expected by some experts this month in the face of slightly slower hiring, and of anxiety on Wall Street after a plunge in Chinese stocks and economic uncertainty in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report Tuesday morning, the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index for May is expected to show a 0.3 percent rise, another sign that the residential real estate market remains robust. —Nelson D. Schwartz</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Twitter</span> and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> to Post Earnings</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of the most popular social media services will report their second-quarter financial results this week. <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> will post its results on Tuesday after the market close. The microbroadcasting service has warned Wall Street several times, most recently in June, not to expect blowout revenue numbers. And analysts expect weak to no growth in the number of people using the service. Investors are more interested in how <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>’s interim chief executive, Jack Dorsey, fields questions about his dual role at <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> and Square and whether he announces any initiatives or products. The company may report on progress in the search for a permanent chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expectations are higher for <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, the world’s largest social network with 1.4 billion users, which will share its results on Wednesday after the market close. The company’s stock is trading near a record high, and investors will want to see evidence that recent torrid growth is continuing. Video advertising has been growing rapidly, and the company’s Instagram photo-sharing app has said it will open the service to many more ads. Expenses have been rising as <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> invests heavily to complete newer projects, such as the Oculus virtual reality headsets due early next year, and longer-term initiatives like beaming the Internet to the world’s unconnected via lasers and drones. —Vindu Goel</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Results From Europe’s Biggest Lenders</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank earnings reports are expected to kick into high gear this week as several of Europe’s biggest lenders report their first-half results. European lenders reporting their second-quarter results include the Swiss bank <span class="companylink">UBS</span>; the British lenders <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>, <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland</span> and <span class="companylink">Lloyds Banking Group</span>; the Spanish bank Santander; the German lender <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>; and the French bank <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>. Merger and acquisition advisory fees and equity trading have been strong for investment banks that have reported so far, as deal activity has been healthy this year. Initial public offerings, however, have been lighter in Europe this year than last year, which set a breakneck pace. Another big question for many of Europe’s biggest investment banks will be the performance of their fixed-income operations — particularly as uncertainty about Greece’s financial future weighed on market activity in June. <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> both reported declines in their fixed-income trading revenue during the second quarter, and weakness in that business cut into <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>’s results in the quarter. —Chad Bray</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed’s Policy-Making Committee to Meet</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> will continue its long, slow march toward raising interest rates when its policy-making committee meets Tuesday and Wednesday. Fed officials have suggested they are not ready to raise rates just yet. But the Fed could use its postmeeting statement to strengthen expectations that it is on course to raise rates for the first time since the Great Recession when the committee next meets in September. —Binyamin Appelbaum</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Windows 10 Will be Available to Some</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every few years, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> introduces a new version of its operating system, Windows — one of the world’s most widely used software products. That time has come again, and now <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> is taking a different approach to get users to download the software as soon as possible. On Wednesday, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> will make Windows 10, its newest offering, available for a first wave of consumers to download onto their existing computers. The update will be available to these users free, a first for <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> is hoping users update to Windows 10 because they see value in new features like Cortana, a virtual assistant that schedules appointments and performs other tasks. Windows 10 will also give <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> a common operating system that powers PCs, smartphones, game consoles and other devices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its biggest imperative is to create a huge market for Windows 10 devices, thus attracting app-writing developers, who have drifted away from <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> toward <span class="companylink">Google</span>’s Android and Apple’s iOS mobile operating systems. —Nick Wingfield</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil Earnings</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is earnings week for the oil majors. <span class="companylink">Exxon Mobil</span>, <span class="companylink">Chevron</span>, <span class="companylink">Royal Dutch Shell</span>, <span class="companylink">BP</span> and Total will all report their second-quarter results. The news will probably be disappointing but not surprising; oil prices are half what they were a year ago. These integrated companies, though, should do better than smaller oil companies and service companies because the larger organizations run refineries, which are earning profits since demand for gasoline has been rising. —Clifford Krauss</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United States Economic Growth Estimate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, the <span class="companylink">United States Department of Commerce</span> will announce its initial estimate of economic growth in the second quarter. Experts estimate that after an unexpected drop in output in the first three months of the year, the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.6 percent last quarter. The rebound was probably driven by healthy consumer spending, strong growth in residential real estate spending and government expenditures, and an improved trade picture. —Nelson D. Schwartz</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Time Warner Cable</span> Results</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Time Warner Cable</span> is scheduled to report its second-quarter results on Thursday, its first earnings report since the cable company announced its $56.7 billion sale to <span class="companylink">Charter Communications</span>. The transaction is part of a pair of deals Charter announced in May that, if approved, would create the country’s second-largest cable and broadband operator, with 24 million customers in 41 states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street will be looking for clues about how regulators view the deal. <span class="companylink">Time Warner Cable</span>’s previous deal with <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> collapsed under intense regulatory pressure. In addition, investors will be looking for whether <span class="companylink">Time Warner Cable</span> managed to sustain the strong performance it reported during the first quarter, when it delivered its strongest subscriber growth in years. —Emily Steel</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Puerto Rico Debt Payments Due</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Puerto Rico, the United States territory that’s teetering on the edge of insolvency, has two critical debt payments due on Saturday. There are mounting questions about whether the island’s Public Finance Corporation and the Government Development Bank will be able to make scheduled debt payments that day. Recently, the government said that the Legislature had not appropriated money for the Public Finance Corporation payment, signaling that it might be skipped. —Michael Corkery</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- New single-family home sales in the United States fell in June to a seven-month low, and May's sales were revised sharply down, but the data released on Friday did little to change the belief that the housing market recovery was strengthening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes account for only 8.1 percent of the housing market and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. June's surprise decline and the May revisions also are at odds with other housing data showing strong momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We should not get too worried about the signal from the new-home sales data at this point,'' said Daniel Silver, an economist at <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales dropped 6.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 482,000 units, the lowest level since last November, the Commerce Department said. May's sales pace was cut to 517,000 units from 546,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite two months of declines in new-home sales, they were up 18.1 percent compared with June of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is being supported by a tightening labor market, which has unleashed demand from young adults. Government efforts to ease lending conditions for first-time buyers through mortgage finance firms <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> also have helped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report on Wednesday showed that home resales jumped in June to the highest they had been in eight years. Data last week showed building permits were near an eight-year peak in June, and housing starts were increasing solidly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks on Wall Street traded lower on Friday, while prices for United States government debt rose marginally. The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We see no reason to change our view that housing activity is on an upswing,'' said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong housing momentum suggests that the economy remains on solid ground despite a surprise drop in retail sales last month and a struggling manufacturing sector, and should be able to absorb an interest-rate increase expected later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States economy is on better footing than its global peers. Data on Friday showed that Chinese manufacturing contracted in July to a 15-month low. Business activity in the eurozone slowed this month, with the weakness blamed on the impact of Greece's debt crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United States manufacturing, which has been hobbled by a strong dollar and spending cuts by energy companies, showed signs of stabilizing in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the financial data firm Markit said its preliminary United States Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose this month to 53.8 from a 20-month low of 53.6 in June. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the factory sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the gain, manufacturers said investment spending cuts in the energy sector continued to weigh on sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a modest rise in new work from abroad, which ended three months of falling export sales across the manufacturing sector. Still, manufacturers were cautious about hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Markit survey confirms that U.S. manufacturing is likely to see only a sluggish pace of growth in the third quarter,'' said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> in New York.Economists expect that housing will partly offset manufacturing's drag on the economy this year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sprawling, 18,000-square-foot house in Wainscott, N.Y., with more than 2,000 feet of frontage on secluded Georgica Pond, and interiors enhanced with custom millwork, Cotswold stone and state-of-the-art technology, is about to go on the market for $95 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property taxes on the Long Island residence -- known as Burnt Point because it is on a peninsula that was the site of a forest fire at the turn of the 20th century -- are $142,893.76 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shingled, gambrel-roofed house, which is being sold fully furnished (without the artwork), is on 25 private acres at 38 Mathews Road, with ocean views across the pond to the southeast. It was designed by Francis Fleetwood and completed in 1999 for David Campbell, a commodities trader. The interior architecture is by Brian O'Keefe and the beach-inspired interior design is by Marjorie Shushan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 18-room main house has five bedrooms, two elevators and six stone fireplaces. The plank floors are 200-year-old oak, and the kitchen and family room have vaulted ceilings with antique wooden beams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upstairs, the master suite has east and west terraces and an opulent bathroom. The lower level has a screening room, a full gym, a billiards room, and a wine cellar and tasting room. A guest wing with three bedrooms and three and a half baths is connected to the main house by a Cotswold stone breezeway; it has a great room with a kitchen and a fireplace. And adjacent to a heated infinity pool is a screened porch with a limestone floor, a dining area and a built-in barbecue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are views of the water and the landscape from almost every room. Among the outdoor entertainment options are the pool, which has a waterfall and spa, a waterside gazebo, a dock, a greenhouse and a secluded tennis court with a viewing pavilion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parking is plentiful: In addition to a heated four-car garage on the lower level of the main house, there are six spots in the two barnlike outbuildings that contain the estate's mechanical systems and are connected to the house by underground tunnels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, the estate was sold for $45 million to Stewart J. Rahr, a billionaire pharmaceuticals entrepreneur. At the time, Forbes reported that the price set a record for a single-family home not just in the Hamptons, but in the state of New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, asking prices in excess of $100 million have become commonplace for impressive waterfront properties in the area. Frank E. Newbold, an associate broker at <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> and one of three marketing agents for Burnt Point -- or, as it was rechristened by Mr. Rahr, Rah Rah Land -- said the record for a Hamptons residence is $147 million, set last year on Further Lane in East Hampton, and the most expensive property now on the market is a $145 million oceanfront house on Gin Lane in Southampton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The moment I saw Burnt Point, I knew I had to own it,'' Mr. Rahr said by email from Paris. ''The home's craftsmanship and the grounds' peaceful tranquility were beyond what I'd ever experienced. The frontage on Georgica Pond, with its never-ending pageant of natural beauty, is breathtaking.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rahr is parting with the estate, he said, because he now summers in Europe. In 2010, he sold Kinray, the pharmaceutical distribution company founded by his father, to <span class="companylink">Cardinal Health</span> for $1.3 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, Mr. Rahr transferred ownership of the estate to the Stewart J. Rahr Foundation. ''By donating this house to my charitable foundation,'' he said, ''its contributions to medical research and youth initiatives can be stepped up to an even higher level.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Newbold, who listed the property with Ed Petrie of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> and Mala Sander of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, said the house's unusual configuration, acreage and views justified its lofty price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is the largest property available in East Hampton, it has drop-dead water views on three sides, and it is a house that is absolutely ready to move into,'' Mr. Newbold said. ''The amount of land and location is what makes it so extraordinary, and it is being sold furnished. It's like the art market: If something is unique and best in class, there will be a buyer.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Builders in the United States broke ground on apartment complexes last month at the fastest pace in nearly 28 years as developers anticipated that recent jobs gains would create a wave of renters. Also in June, rising gasoline prices pushed inflation up modestly, leaving overall consumer prices higher than they were a year earlier for the first time since December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said on Friday that housing starts in June climbed 9.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.17 million homes. All of that growth came from a 28.6 percent surge in multifamily housing that put apartment construction at its highest rate since November 1987. Starts for single-family houses slipped 0.9 percent last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gains show that what had been a sluggish construction sector is now running on economic adrenaline. Strong job growth and a rebounding economy have increased the numbers of buyers and renters searching for homes, while gradually rising mortgage rates have spurred homeowners to complete deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The residential market recovery is here, and it is strong and sustainable," said Peter Ciganik, managing director at the real estate investor <span class="companylink">GTIS Partners</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts increased 35.3 percent in the Northeast because of apartments, while climbing 13.5 percent in the South. Home construction slumped in the Midwest and West in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Nationwide</span>, housing starts have risen 10.9 percent year-to-date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last 12 months, employers have added 2.9 million jobs, meaning there are that many more people with paychecks to spend across the broader economy. The impact of those job gains and the unemployment rate dropping to 5.3 percent has surfaced in housing, where demand is outpacing the supply of homes and creating more pressure to build houses and apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for new homes for sale had just 4.5 months of supply in May, compared with six months in a healthy market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the financial distress has also left more Americans renting instead of owning, creating a need for more apartments. The share of Americans owning homes has fallen so far this year to a seasonally adjusted 63.8 percent, the lowest level since 1989.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Approved building permits increased 7.4 percent to an annual rate of 1.34 million in June, the highest level since July 2007. The bulk of that increase came for apartment complexes, while permits for houses last month rose just 0.9 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Friday, the Labor Department said that its Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent last month. Prices at the gas pump rose 3.4 percent in June on top of a 10.4 percent increase in May. An outbreak of avian flu drove egg prices up 18.3 percent in June, but overall food prices rose just 0.3 percent. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, so-called core inflation was 0.2 percent last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall consumer prices rose just 0.1 percent the last year; core prices are up 1.8 percent. Gasoline prices are down 23.3 percent over the last year; they hit bottom in January, then rebounded.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">A Philadelphia Workplace, With Millennials in Mind</span>
</div><div class="author">By JON HURDLE   </div><div>1279 words</div><div>8 July 2015</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHILADELPHIA -- A boxy brown-brick distribution center on the northeast side of downtown may become the latest project for millennial-focused redevelopment of an old industrial area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 250,000-square-foot building, now occupied by a distributor of maternity clothing, will be remade into a center for media, advertising and technology companies, under plans recently announced by the developer, Alliance Partners HSP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building, in an industrial zone between Philadelphia's Chinatown and the rapidly developing Northern Liberties neighborhood, will be reconfigured at a cost of about $50 million into space expected to accommodate up to eight tenants employing a total of 1,000 to 1,500 workers in an open-plan arrangement, the developer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alliance is also considering offering space to smaller companies that need 2,000 to 5,000 square feet, said Matt Handel, the company's director of leasing. If that happens, the building might be occupied by five or six large companies and 15 or 20 smaller tenants, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project aims to tap into an influx of millennials -- those born between the early 1980s and the early 2000s -- who are being drawn to Philadelphia by growing job opportunities and housing that, for now, is more affordable than that in Washington or New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city is also retaining more local university students who are staying after graduation in response to the growing job market, greater availability of housing, improved amenities such as public parks, and a vibrant downtown restaurant scene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By creating the new space on the southern edge of the already millennial-rich Northern Liberties and within a 20-minute walk of City Hall, Alliance believes it will be well positioned to attract tenants that employ the targeted work force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They wanted to be able to recruit, to have millennials think that this would be a great place to work,'' said Richard R. Previdi, the firm's operating managing partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Previdi said the new space -- named SoNo, for south of Northern Liberties -- will be designed to encourage the collaboration that is highly valued by tenants like software companies. ''They want everybody talking; they want everybody sharing ideas,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The redesign will minimize the amount of individual employee space while allowing more for common areas like a cafeteria, a gym and parking space for 70 bicycles. Alliance plans to begin construction by the end of this year, and to complete the project within 24 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, the building's location and design are intended for a ''live-work-play'' lifestyle in which young urban professionals live near their workplaces and the shops, restaurants and entertainment sites that spring up to meet that demand in Philadelphia and other cities, Mr. Previdi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His hopes of tapping into the market would seem to be encouraged by activity in Northern Liberties, where construction crews on many blocks are building properties that include three-bedroom townhouses with starting prices in the mid-$700,000s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Fravel, a real estate agent with <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway</span> HomeServices who sells in the area around SoNo, said home prices had more than doubled in the neighborhood since the end of the recession, thanks to surging demand from employees of major local employers, including <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> and the <span class="companylink">University of Pennsylvania</span>, that are ''rushing to hire talent,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand is further fueled by transplanted New Yorkers who discover that even in Northern Liberties they can buy twice as much house for half the price they would pay in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A boom in new houses, which are often sold before they are completed, has used up all available land and pushed buyers into surrounding areas, Mr. Fravel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's driving not only Northern Liberties but also the fringe neighborhoods,'' he said. ''Anywhere within a bike ride -- everyone bikes nowadays.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for bicycling to and from the new development would be satisfied in part by plans for a greenway along the currently uninviting Spring Garden Street, which marks the northern edge of the new development and is a main east-west route along the north side of central Philadelphia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help meet the demand for ''play,'' the building is within a short bike ride of several live-music venues, including Union Transfer. A new <span class="companylink">Live Nation</span> concert space is under construction in a former factory near the Delaware River about half a mile away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the SoNo building is a few hundred yards from a planned Rail Park, a three-mile section of a long-abandoned rail line that is being converted to an elevated urban park similar to the High Line in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the neighborhood faces stiff competition from other areas like Center City and West Philadelphia that may be more attractive to the millennial market, argued David M. Scolnic, a real estate lawyer at <span class="companylink">Hangley Aronchick Segal Pudlin &amp; Schiller</span> in Philadelphia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If I were a young person looking for a job I would much rather work in Center City or in West Philadelphia, where there are amenities and places to go at lunch and after work,'' he said. ''It's hard to picture this being an attractive option.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the SoNo building is close to Northern Liberties and the Old City section a few blocks to the south, it's not clear that the location is attractive enough to millennials to match the developer's expectations, Mr. Scolnic said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also argued that the projected rent -- in the low $30s per square foot, according to Mr. Previdi -- is a ''pretty high number'' that is in line with Class A space in Center City and may be hard for the developer to obtain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential redevelopment of the building would have been a more obviously attractive plan, Mr. Scolnic said, because it is next to an already-hot neighborhood and investors are far more willing to lend for residential projects than for commercial buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, it's not clear that the SoNo building is in the right place to attract the companies it needs, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's really not near anything else,'' he said. ''They are trying to rely on the living proximity of a lot of millennials to make this an exciting location, and I don't know that's what millennials want. I don't know that working in Spring Garden, yet, is an attractive option.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Alan Greenberger, Philadelphia's deputy mayor for economic development, predicted the project would attract the workers it needs, and would be the first redevelopment in an industrial zone bounded by Spring Garden, Callowhill, Second and Sixth Streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's other development pressure in the area,'' he said. ''In the next five- or 10-year stretch, you are going to see a lot of redevelopment there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The City Council is working on changing the zoning to mixed-use commercial, with some residential development likely as well, while the city is seeking dense urban development rather than high rises surrounded by parking lots, Mr. Greenberger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When other projects are completed, the area will link Old City to the south with Northern Liberties to the north, Mr. Greenberger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've always felt that closing that gap, and making it more walkable and lively between two great neighborhoods,'' he said, ''was both desirable and inevitable.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average price of homes in Manhattan rises to $1.87 million, up 11 percent from 2014; median sales price is $980,000, just shy of 2008 record of $1.025 million. (M) </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — Home prices in the United States increased at a solid clip in April, led by double-digit jumps in Denver and San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span>/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose 4.9 percent in April from 12 months earlier, roughly the same annual pace as March, S.&amp;P. <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> Indices said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report on Tuesday, consumer confidence showed a solid gain in June following a modest increase in May, indicating that strong job gains are aiding the overall economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Job growth and low mortgage rates have brought greater demand for housing, lifting home values. The gains are at roughly double the pace of wage growth, but current levels appear more manageable than the double-digit home price increases seen during parts of 2013 and 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These gains are probably sustainable,” said David Berson, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Nationwide Insurance</span>. “They’re not so rapid as to cause worry that people won’t be able to afford to buy the average home.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in the Denver metro areas climbed 10.3 percent, while home values in San Francisco rose 10 percent. Values increased more than 7.5 percent in Dallas, Miami, Seattle and Tampa. But growth was tepid in the Boston, Cleveland and Washington areas, where prices were up by 1.8 percent or less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller index covers roughly half of American homes. It measures prices compared with those in January 2000 and creates a three-month moving average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data show faster increases in prices, reflecting a shortage of homes available in the market. May sales figures from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> found that median home prices increased 7.9 percent over the last 12 months to $228,700, about $1,700 shy of the July 2006 peak. The market has a 5.1-month supply of homes, versus an average of six months in a healthy market. Relatively low mortgage rates have aided home values. The average for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 4.02 percent, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Still, that average has been steadily rising from a 52-week low of 3.59 percent, creating more pressure for buyers to close deals now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Tuesday, the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said that its consumer confidence index rose to 101.4 in June, up from 94.6 in May. The June level matches the level in March. The index took a tumble in April, but it’s now 17.4 percent higher than it was a year ago, evidence that the economy is poised to enjoy stronger growth in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The June gain, which was stronger than economists had expected, was supported by increases in consumer views about current conditions and the labor market. Those expressing the view that jobs were plentiful rose to 21.4 percent, up from 20.6 percent in the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“After a brief setback, consumer confidence appears to be surging anew,” said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. “Continued improvement in job market conditions and income growth should help sustain an optimistic mood and provide fuel for spending growth.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After flirting with records for more than a year, the average sales price of a Manhattan [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/manhattan/?inline=nyt-geo] apartment hit a new high in the second quarter, according to at least two reports to be released on Wednesday by major real estate brokerage firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strong local economy, combined with high demand and not enough listings, pushed the average sales price up 11 percent, to $1.87 million, compared with the same period in 2014, surpassing the previous peak of $1.77 million reached in the first quarter of last year, according to Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and the author of a report for <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price, which measures the middle of the market and is less affected by high-end sales, was $980,000, just behind the record of $1.025 million set in the second quarter of 2008, before the financial crisis hit, according to Miller Samuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s like everyone revved up their engines again,” said Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, which put the record average sales price at $1.81 million and the median at $960,000. “We saw continuous demand across all price points, buoyed by some exciting new developments that have come on the market and a continued influx of buyers from China.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In all my years of doing this,” she added, “I have never seen such a hunger for New York City real estate.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other market&nbsp;reports using different numbers and methodologies put the overall average price just shy of previous records, but a number of reports posted records in a variety of categories. The average price of new development and resale condos reached a new high of $2.41 million in the second quarter, according to <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>. Reports by&nbsp;Halstead&nbsp;Property and Brown Harris Stevens noted that prices of resale apartments broke new barriers for the same period, and put the average price of resale apartments at $1.57 million and the median price at $920,700.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The higher prices were driven by two key factors. Inventory growth has begun to stall, especially in the resale market, where potential sellers are reluctant to list their properties as they are often outbid, turned down for loans or simply cannot find what they are looking for. The number of available listings barely budged, up 1.3 percent in the second quarter to 5,730, compared with a year ago, according to <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, most of the fresh listings making their way onto the market are coming from new developments, which have primarily offered larger residences at higher prices. “Many of the developers were very smart in the type of product they brought to the market,” Ms. Leibman said. “Developers helped to create and fuel the demand by offering these high-end luxury condos with views and amenities, and foreign buyers in particular have really responded. Everybody keeps raising the bar.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rising prices have also contributed to a drop in sales, said Diane M. Ramirez, chief executive of Halstead Property, which found that the number of reported closings declined 10 percent to 2,430 in the second quarter from the same period last year. “Sellers are holding firm in their price, and buyers are only going forward if the price makes sense to them,” Ms. Ramirez said. “So you are seeing fewer closings.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ramirez said if buyers can’t find what they are looking for or sellers refuse to price appropriately, the lack of inventory is exacerbated. “It is a vicious cycle, and buyers are continuing to be frustrated,” she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, who authored the <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> report, pointed out that the number of sales fell year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter, but noted that those decreases were coming off a flurry of sales activity in 2013. “It’s a reset from the record sales we had in 2013 and early 2014 that were a result of pent-up demand,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Value, however, is a relative term when it comes to Manhattan real estate. “We look at the prices and we don’t even blink, because we’re so used to them,” said Dottie Herman, the chief executive of Douglas Elliman. “But anyplace else, they’re outrageous.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Contracts to buy existing homes in the United States rose in May to their highest level in just over nine years, a further boost to the housing market and the broader economic outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Monday that its pending home sales index, based on contracts signed last month, increased 0.9 percent to 112.6, the highest level since April 2006. Contracts have now increased for five straight months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and the increase last month pointed to further gains in home resales after they hit a five-and-a-half-year high in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The recent trend suggests that we will see continued strength in resales in the months ahead. However, the current low inventory levels, which are placing upward pressure on home prices, remain a downside risk,'' said Derek Lindsey, an analyst at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market recovery is back on track after being hit hard by bad weather at the start of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is being bolstered by a tightening labor market, which is helping to spur some pickup in wage growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pending home sales report added to robust building permits, housing starts, new-home sales and home resales data in painting a bullish picture of the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also joined strong retail sales, consumer sentiment and employment data in suggesting a building up of momentum in the economy after a mild contraction in output in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales increased 10.4 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contracts increased 6.3 percent in the Northeast and rose 2.2 percent in the West. They slipped 0.8 percent in the South and dipped 0.6 percent in the Midwest.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- More Americans bought homes in May, a sign of economic strength that is pushing up average prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Monday that sales of used homes climbed 5.1 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.35 million. May was the third consecutive month of the sales rate's exceeding five million homes on an annual basis, putting home-buying on pace for its best year since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solid hiring since 2014 and relatively low mortgage rates have stirred up demand and helped generate more first-time buyers, though rising sales have propelled prices because relatively few properties are listed for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can credit that to the stronger job market, a more confident consumer" and some additional listings in an otherwise tight market, said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">BMO Capital Markets</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the buying might also reflect a rush to capture the benefits of lower interest rates and relatively cheap prices that are jumping higher each month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There may be some anticipation of prices going even higher, which is sparking a move off the sidelines," Ms. Lee added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home prices climbed 7.9 percent over the last 12 months to $228,700, about $1,700 shy of the July 2006 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market has just 5.1 months' supply of homes, versus an average of six months in a healthy market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say that the sales gains of recent months could be short-lived if prices increase so sharply that buyers are priced out of the market. The recent rise in mortgage rates could also curtail sales, as it did in the middle of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, real estate has begun to show some strength after muddling through much of the six-year recovery from the recession that has left millions of Americans still owing more on their mortgages than their homes are worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales jumped in all four major geographic regions: Northeast, Midwest, South and West. First-time buyers also accounted for a growing share of sales, a sign that younger buyers are returning to the market after enduring an economic downturn and sluggish rebound that delayed their purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 32 percent of the homes sold last month went to first-timers, compared with 27 percent a year ago. The improvement is substantial but lags the historical average of 40 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Americans signed contracts to buy used homes in April, which should translate into more completed sales in coming months. The Realtors' seasonally adjusted pending home sales index climbed 3.4 percent to 112.4 in April, the highest reading since May 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low mortgage rates have helped, although rates are now starting to steadily rise in ways that might limit sales later in the year. Average 30-year fixed rates were 4 percent last week, according to the mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That average has increased from a 52-week low of 3.59 percent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United States stocks closed higher on Monday, with the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> reaching a record as hopes grew that a deal would be reached to prevent Greece from defaulting on loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks have been largely driven by the situation in Greece of late, with investors concerned that if the country defaults on its loans, it may have to leave the euro or the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>, potentially shaking the region’s economic foundations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Athens presented new reform proposals that eurozone finance ministers cautiously welcomed on Monday, though they said the proposals required detailed study and that it would take several days to determine whether they can lead to an agreement. Greece needs fresh cash to avoid defaulting on a $1.8 billion debt repayment to the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> on June 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This takes one anxiety off the table, even if it doesn’t yet resolve the primary issues that made investors anxious in the first place,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average rose 103.83 points, or 0.58 percent, to 18,119.78, while the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span> 500-stock index gained 12.86 points, or 0.61 percent, to 2,122.85. The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> composite index added 36.97 points, or 0.72 percent, to 5,153.97.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the day’s gains, the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> ended at a record while the S.&amp;P. 500 closed 0.3 percent away from its own record close. The S.&amp;P. 500 now trades at 17.3 times earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data, above its long-term average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Valuations are somewhat high, but there aren’t many alternatives that look attractive,” Mr. McCain said. “Stocks will probably get a lot higher before there’s any serious risk of a pullback on valuation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the developments related to Greece, sentiment was also lifted by merger-and-acquisition activity. The S.&amp;P. energy index rose 1 percent as the top-performing sector of the day after Energy Transfer Equity confirmed it had made a $48 billion unsolicited bid for <span class="companylink">the Williams Companies</span>, hours after Williams rejected the offer as significantly too low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of Williams surged 26 percent, to $60.90, and were the biggest percentage gainer on the S.&amp;P. 500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, <span class="companylink">Cigna</span> rose 4.8 percent, to $162.65, after the health insurer rebuffed Anthem’s $47 billion merger proposal on Sunday. Anthem rose 3.6 percent, to $171.04.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homebuilders rose as existing home sales grew more than expected in May, surging to their highest in five and a half years. The PHLX Housing index rose 0.9 percent while <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> added 1.7 percent, to $49.49.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia</span> slumped 12.5 percent, to $6.11, on heavy volume after Sequential Brands agreed to buy the company in a deal that values it at about $353 million, or $6.15 a share. Martha Stewart shares had risen about 37 percent over two days after news of the deal emerged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the <span class="companylink">New York Stock Exchange</span> by 1,830 to 1,238, for a 1.48-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span>, 1,819 issues rose and 988 fell for a 1.84-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.&amp;P. 500 index was posting 51 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> was recording 207 new highs and 26 new lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 5.31 billion shares traded on all United States platforms, according to BATS exchange data, compared with the month-to-date average of 6.17 billion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donte and Anjoli Hill postponed their honeymoon indefinitely and squirreled away cash wedding gifts in order to afford the down payment on the four-bedroom house they bought a few months ago in this Tampa suburb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the process, they weren’t just securing a home where they could start a family. They were helping the United States housing market return to normal pricing after 15 years of yo-yoing insanity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade ago, the market was unquestionably too hot. Four years ago it was too cold. Now, by a wide range of measures, nationwide home prices look relatively normal when compared with incomes, rents and other fundamentals — and are rising at similar low, single-digit rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast to the periods of irrational optimism and pessimism, the market is settling into a balance in which buyers are comfortable spending what they can afford, but aren’t willing (or able to persuade lenders) to stretch beyond that. Among buyers there is neither a sense of desperation to buy now on the assumption prices will rise rapidly, nor of fear they will plummet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a while in 2013 and early 2014, national home prices were rising at a double-digit percentage rate, which if sustained could have rapidly led housing back to its bubble-era extremes. But the reality — of caution on the part of home buyers and their lenders — soon set in. In the 12 months ended in March, the S.&amp;P. Case-Shiller national home price index rose 4.1 percent, not much higher than the rise in Americans’ incomes and consistent with longer-term trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘The market is coming back, but we’re not having astronomical growth,’’ said Thomas O’Bryant Jr., the chief executive of the Greater Tampa Association of Realtors. ‘‘We’re having the kind of growth that is going to be sustainable, and any time you have steady growth it’s much better than having bubble growth.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have risen faster than incomes and rents since the beginning of the last decade, and by those measures remain high by historical standards. But a downward march in mortgage rates has made housing more affordable on a typical American’s income. Add it all up, and <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> calculates that American housing is currently 3 percent overvalued, which counts as sustainable in the firm’s analysis. That compares with early 2006, when it was 26 percent overvalued versus economic fundamentals, and the end of 2011 when it was 7 percent undervalued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar calculations by economists at the real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> this year found that the national housing market was 2 percent undervalued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As always with housing, each local market has its own dynamics. Analysis from Fitch suggests that there are signs of excessive home prices in the Bay Area and other coastal markets, and of continued underpricing in parts of New England and the industrial Midwest. And there are plenty of markets where both rents and home prices have risen much faster than incomes over the last generation, so affordability is an issue in much of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to see how home prices are now lining up better with fundamentals, consider the yellow 2,700-square-foot house on Spoonflower Circle where the Hills have been busy installing new door fixtures and a ceiling fan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was built in 2006 and sold for $304,388, then was in foreclosure limbo for years before selling for $141,000 last year while it was in need of improvements. The Hills, who married last September, paid $192,000 in March and were able to move in to a house with new appliances and fresh paint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A person earning the 2006 average weekly wage in Pasco County, where the house is, would have had to pay 73 percent of her income to buy the house, assuming prevailing mortgage rates and a 10 percent down payment. At the house’s foreclosure last year, that fell to 22 percent, given the lower sale price and mortgage rates, along with inflation and income growth. The mortgage on the price the Hills paid in March equaled 29 percent of an average county resident’s income, about the level financial planners recommend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a long round trip, the price of the house in this particular suburban subdivision pretty much makes sense given the incomes of middle-class people in the surrounding county.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donte Hill, 31, sells insurance for a living; Anjoli, 33, works in marketing. Their decision to buy after years of renting embodies the new era of balance in the housing and rental markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘You want stability, and so you want to make sure you can afford it and sustain the debt you’re taking on, so that you have something no one can take away from you,’’ Ms. Hill said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She made spreadsheets to figure out what they could afford; he researched risks of things like sinkholes and flooding. By their math, renting a house with the equivalent of their mortgage payment would have covered a somewhat smaller house, and the total costs of renting versus buying — incorporating things like homeowners’ association fees — are roughly equivalent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their lender, they said, carefully vetted their income and where the down payment had come from.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘They verified three years of employment and checked all our stocks, mutual funds, bank accounts,’’ Mr. Hill said. ‘‘They wanted to know where it came from, why we transferred it. That helps you feel comfortable that they’re looking at it in depth.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade ago, Brenna Eddins, who was the Hills’ real estate agent for the home purchase, worked for a builder. Every Saturday morning, a line of people would be at their model homes, to ensure their names were first on the list to purchase newly released houses for sale. ‘‘It was the most frenzied situation I’d ever seen,’’ she said, ‘‘like a <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> on Black Friday.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, home prices in Wesley Chapel rose 29 percent, according to data from Zillow, the real estate listing service. The same year, rents in the Tampa area rose less than 3 percent, according to Labor Department data, meaning that homes became far less affordable relative to a similar-size rental that year. Over long periods of time, those numbers would be expected to move roughly in tandem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The collapse that began in 2007 created a different set of problems, as the lengthy process of foreclosures and short sales dragged out, and the only buyers in the market seemed to be investors looking to acquire cheap houses to rent out. Wesley Chapel home prices fell 49 percent from mid-2006 to early 2012, a span in which Tampa-area rents rose 10 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, investors are retreating as prices recover, and people buying houses to live in are returning — though not with the fervor and pay-anything sensibility of a decade ago. ‘‘I’m seeing younger buyers being more cautious and approaching this as a longer-term investment,’’ Ms. Eddins said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the fact that the relatively balanced housing prices of today are dependent on mortgage rates’ being near record lows does create some risks, argues Michelle Meyer, deputy head of United States economics at <span class="companylink">Bank of America-Merrill Lynch</span>. An abrupt rise could sharply reduce housing affordability and push down prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It all depends on why rates rise, and how quickly. ‘‘If rates are rising because of stronger economic growth, the housing market should be able to absorb the hit and it will be perfectly manageable,’’ she said. ‘‘But if mortgage rates rise for external factors or for reasons not warranted by growth in the economy, it would be damaging.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, a reversal in the era of low interest rates and cheap money wouldn’t have consequences just on Wall Street. It could matter a lot on Spoonflower Circle as well.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Permits for home construction in the United States surged to a nearly eight-year high in May, suggesting a building up of momentum in housing and the broader economy after a dismal performance at the start of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While housing starts fell last month, that followed a robust gain in April, and groundbreaking remained at levels consistent with a strengthening housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improving fortunes for housing, shown in rising home prices and sales, will probably be acknowledged by <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> officials, who started a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Policy makers have repeatedly singled out housing as a weak spot in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Residential construction has been the laggard in this recovery, and the moonshot surge in new permits today means the final piece of the recovery puzzle is now falling into place,'' said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at <span class="companylink">MUFG Union Bank</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits jumped 11.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.28 million units, the highest since August 2007, the Commerce Department said. It was the second straight month of increases. Permits have been above a one million-unit pace since July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Groundbreaking dropped 11.1 percent to a rate of 1.04 million units. Though that partly reversed the prior month's large gain, April starts were revised up to a 1.17 million-unit rate, the highest since November 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department report came on the heels of solid reports on retail sales, consumer confidence and employment that have suggested the economy was rebounding from the first quarter's soft patch, when gross domestic product contracted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building has regained ground lost during a harsh winter and there are signs activity will accelerate this year as tightening labor market conditions spur stronger wage gains and encourage young adults to establish their own households.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists anticipate that the housing market will strengthen enough to take up some of the slack from the struggling manufacturing sector and support economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits for single-family homes, which account for the largest share of the market, increased 2.6 percent to their highest level since December. Building permits for the volatile multifamily segment soared 24.9 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits for buildings with five units or more increased to their highest level since January 1990. The multifamily sector is being driven by demand for rental accommodation as more people move away from homeownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits in the Northeast vaulted to their highest level since March 1987 and were at a near one-year high in the Midwest. They fell, however, in the South and West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Groundbreaking for single-family homes dropped 5.4 percent to a 680,000-unit pace. Multifamily starts tumbled 20.2 percent to a 356,000-unit rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Groundbreaking fell in all four regions, declining a steep 26.5 percent in the Northeast after April's spectacular gains. Starts in the South, where most of the home building takes place, dropped 5 percent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOSTON</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR many Americans, the housing crisis is a distant memory. That includes the Supreme Court, which on Monday refused to help out struggling homeowners with second mortgages, ruling that they could not get out from under those mortgages by filing for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for many lower-income Americans, the housing bust of 2008 was just a prelude to a new crisis. In many areas, housing prices are stuck below their inflated pre-bubble levels. Until we deal with this fact, entire communities will continue to struggle with high foreclosure rates and a lack of economic mobility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is rooted in a consequence of the post-2008 return to sane mortgage underwriting practices. Loan officers are no longer handing out mortgages left and right, but instead are tying them to borrowers' income. As a result, housing prices can rise only if incomes rise, or if people can spend a greater share of their income on housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the poorest fifth of Americans already spend more than 40 percent of their income on housing, compared with less than 31 percent for the upper fifth, according to government data. Meanwhile, real wages for most Americans have been flat or falling for decades. Absent an extraordinary increase in income for low-income families, home prices in low-income areas aren't going anywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This disparity between high- and low-income neighborhoods is evident in the numbers. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index for March was over the March 2004 index, and national median home prices, according to the real estate website Zillow, are just over what they were 10 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the numbers in many of our nation's low-income neighborhoods are far different. In Chicago, home values in Sheffield Neighbors, a well-off neighborhood on the city's north side, have risen almost 9 percent in the last 10 years, according to Zillow. But in the working-class neighborhood of Wrightwood, southwest of the Loop, values are 18 percent lower than they were 10 years ago. And for Chicago as a whole, home values are still 22 percent below where they were 10 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These disparities hold even in cities in which housing prices are flat or rebounding. In Phoenix, home prices are roughly flat over all, but neighborhood prices range from 16 percent growth to a 27 percent drop over the last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners who are underwater aren't building any equity, so they have little incentive to maintain their homes. If they can find a better-paying job somewhere else, they can't sell their home and move away. And if they get sick or lose a job, they are at greater risk of foreclosure because they can't sell the house to get out from under a payment they can't afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what's the right thing to do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, we have to start taking principal reduction seriously. Regulators at every level, as well as the <span class="companylink">Financial Accounting Standards Board</span>, must encourage financial institutions to do what they should have done in the fourth quarter of 2008: recognize their losses and write down the value of mortgages to current market levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar shift is needed at the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>, which regulates the housing giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. National mortgage modification programs should be adjusted to encourage lenders to pursue principal reduction. Tax relief for homeowners who receive reductions should be extended so that write-downs aren't taxed as income, creating a large tax bill that poor families can't afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And we should consider allowing judges to take a loss on mortgages for homeowners in bankruptcy court, where mortgages are currently a protected class of unalterable debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government should also officially designate underwater neighborhoods and communities, not just individual homes. For longtime owner-occupants in such neighborhoods, we should consider a fully refundable tax credit for the total cost of home repairs. Lenders could then provide financing to homeowners in anticipation of the credit. That way underwater homeowners can maintain their homes, even though they have no equity to borrow against, and will never recoup the cost of the repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third, homeowners in underwater neighborhoods who enter into a legitimate sale to a third party should have the difference between their selling price and their outstanding mortgage automatically forgiven, so that they are free to sell without the burden of seeking approval for a short sale and without an adverse impact on their credit scores. They won't make a profit off the sale, but with such a program in place they will be able to sell their house and move for a better job or to be closer to family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, homeowners who work to get out from under their underwater mortgages need to be able to repair their credit in short order so that they can re-enter the homeownership market and again begin to build the kind of equity that helps create financially stable families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Programs like these aren't free. But we could cover some of the cost with the multibillion-dollar settlements that regulators have reached with banks over the last two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we don't act, we will continue to build a generation of low-income residents who are hostage to their mortgages, unable to build equity, unable to participate in the American dream. It's a shame that the technical aspects of bankruptcy law that the Supreme Court upheld ignore that fact. Thousands of homeowners are going to pay the price.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Americans signed contracts to buy homes in April at the fastest pace in nearly nine years, evidence that steady job growth is strengthening the real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Thursday that its seasonally adjusted pending home sales index climbed 3.4 percent to 112.4 last month, for a fourth consecutive monthly gain. The index now is at its highest since May 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The confidence has returned to housing, not only as shelter but as a good long-term investment,'' said Ronald J. Peltier, chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway's real estate affiliate, <span class="companylink">HomeServices of America</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Thursday, the Labor Department said that more Americans sought unemployment benefits last week. The overall level remained low, though, with weekly applications increasing 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 282,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week average, a less volatile measure, rose 5,000 to 271,500. The average had fallen to a 15-year low two weeks ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications are a proxy for layoffs. They have remained below 300,000, a historically low number, for 12 weeks, pointing to a generally healthy job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We continue to get signs that the labor market remains resilient,'' Derek Lindsey, an economist at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>, wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total number of people receiving benefits increased 11,000 to 2.22 million. That figure has fallen 16 percent in the past year, and represents roughly one-quarter of the total number of unemployed. Many of those out of work have used up all their benefits. Others, such as recent college graduates looking for work, are not eligible for unemployment aid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upswing in home sales comes after a year of strong hiring, which has heightened demand to buy houses. Increased sales should help bolster the economy, but the surge could potentially destabilize the housing market, cautioned Mr. Peltier of <span class="companylink">HomeServices of America</span>. Inventories remain low, causing home values to rise at a pace that is eclipsing wage growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signed contracts are a barometer of future purchases. A one- to two-month lag usually exists between a contract and a completed sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales increased in the Northeast, Midwest and South, and barely edged up in the West. Greater demand has propelled sales growth this year after a lackluster 2014. Still, there is evidence that limited inventories are beginning to weigh on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes fell slightly from March to April, to an annual rate of 5.04 million last month, the Realtors reported last week. The decrease may reflect complications in completing sales, in addition to the shortage of listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of homes listed for sale has declined 0.9 percent over the past year, so would-be buyers have fewer choices and may face bidding wars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On average, existing homes sold in 39 days last month, versus 52 days in March and 62 days in February, the Realtors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Nationwide</span>, the median price of an existing home surged 8.9 percent over the past 12 months to $219,400.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Americans bought new homes in April -- evidence that the stronger job market is helping the housing market. The Commerce Department said Tuesday that new home sales climbed 6.8 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 517,000. Sales recovered from a 10 percent dip in March to an annual pace of 484,000. In addition, the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose 5 percent in March from 12 months earlier, S.&amp;P. said Tuesday. Prices increased at the same pace in February. Home values are rising at a faster rate than incomes, potentially pricing many would-be buyers out of the market. But the increases have moderated from the double-digit gains of late 2013 and early last year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Consumer prices in the United States moderated in April on weak gasoline prices, but rising housing and medical care costs bolstered underlying inflation pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said on Friday that its Consumer Price Index gained 0.1 percent last month after increasing 0.2 percent in March. In the 12 months through April, the index fell 0.2 percent, the largest decline since October 2009. In the 12 months through March, it dipped 0.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The so-called core C.P.I., which strips out food and energy costs, increased 0.3 percent, the largest rise since January 2013. The advance in March was 0.2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 12 months through April, the core C.P.I. advanced 1.8 percent after a similar gain in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fading dollar rally also was seen keeping core inflation on an upward trend. The dollar surged about 15 percent against the currencies of the main American trading partners between June last year and mid-March. It has handed back some of those gains and is now up only 10 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If sustained, that should help weakness in core goods prices continue to moderate,'' said Ted Wieseman, an economist at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall C.P.I. edged up 0.1 percent last month after increasing 0.2 percent in March. It was held back by a 1.7 percent drop in gasoline prices and no change in food prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 12 months through April, the C.P.I. fell 0.2 percent, the largest decline since October 2009, after dipping 0.1 percent in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Core inflation was lifted by a 0.3 percent increase in shelter costs, which followed a similar gain in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shelter inflation could continue to increase in the months ahead as rising household formation lifts demand for housing. That, together with a tightening labor market, should put upward pressure on the core C.P.I.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing homes in the United States slipped in April, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Thursday, mainly because of relatively few listings and rising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors group said sales of existing homes fell 3.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.04 million. April was the second consecutive month in which the sales rate topped five million homes. Purchases have recovered from a disappointing 2014 because strong job growth and low mortgage rates have generated more potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that positive sign for the economy has also exposed a problem: Not enough people are listing their properties for sale to meet the demand. Only 5.3 months' supply of homes is on the market, versus an average of six months in a healthy market. The number of listings actually tumbled 0.9 percent in April compared with a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tight supplies have caused properties to fly off the market and prices to rocket upward. The median home sold in just 39 days last month, compared with 52 days in March and 62 days in February. Sales levels dropped in the Northeast, South and West, but they edged up 1.7 percent in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price climbed 8.9 percent over the last 12 months to $219,400. That is more than four times as fast as average hourly wage growth. The median home value is now just $2,500 shy of the 2006 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said that its index of leading indicators rose 0.7 percent last month, the biggest advance since a 1 percent rise last July. The March increase was also revised upward to show a 0.4 percent gain, better than the initial 0.2 percent estimate. The index declined 0.2 percent in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists at the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> say that the solid rebound in April is evidence that the paltry economic performance during the first quarter should be a temporary slowdown. But they cautioned that the pickup in activity could be moderate, given that the April surge in the index was driven by a big jump in applications for building permits while other components of the index showed more modest increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seven of the 10 forward-pointing indicators that make up the index showed strength in April. The largest increase came from the surge in building permits, followed by changes in interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index of factory orders declined, while average weekly manufacturing hours and new orders for consumer goods were unchanged in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said weekly applications for unemployment benefits increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 274,000. The four-week average, a less volatile figure, fell to a fresh 15-year low of 266,250. The number of applications remains at a level that is consistent with a healthy job market.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building across the nation accelerated in April, far exceeding expectations and suggesting that the economy was getting back on track after overall growth ground to a halt during the first quarter of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction last month rose 20.2 percent over March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.135 million, the highest number since 2007 and the biggest percentage jump in almost 24 years, the Commerce Department [http://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf]said[http://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf] on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sunny report wiped out a particularly dismal showing in March and offered a measure of optimism for a housing market that has been slow to recover since the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most economists were cautious in their reading of the month’s data, seeing it as a sign that the housing market was simply returning to a more normal state after the cold and snowy start to the year that kept many builders from breaking new ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s a hell of a rebound in housing, there’s no denying it,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Mizuho Securities</span>. But “you have to keep it in perspective,” he added. “It brings us back to about a million units, which is where it should be.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing data is always volatile, subject to weather and labor supplies. But numbers from the past year echo the trends of the overall economy, which has maintained a slow upward trajectory, interrupted by relatively brief hiccups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And I emphasize the word slow,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief economist at MFR Inc. “I don’t think second-quarter G.D.P. numbers will be any great shakes,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts, however, were more upbeat about what the housing rebound may portend about the broader economic outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This report demolishes the idea that the economy — outside the oil sector — suffered some sort of real seizure in the first quarter,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note to clients. “It didn’t; it was just battered badly by a winter nearly as grim as last year.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shepherdson predicted that new housing construction would continue to rise in coming months, though not as rapidly, and that investment in housing would contribute to economic activity during the second quarter, helping to bring the economy out of its winter stall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department, in its first of three estimates, reported last month that the American economy grew at a mere 0.2 percent annual rate during the first three months of the year. But trade and other data released since then suggest the economy may actually have shrunk over the winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Labor Department last week reported that the producer price index[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/producer_price_index/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] for final demand, which measures inflation at the wholesale level, fell by 0.4 percent in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists predict the Labor Department’s release on Friday of its April consumer price data will show prices rose barely, if at all. One reason for the slow pace is that food costs are little changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the current economic climate, April’s positive housing numbers were not expected to change the Fed’s thinking on when to raise interest rates, which most analysts now don’t expect until September at the earliest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“<span class="companylink">The Fed</span> will look at this as a normalization rather than the beginning of a trend that suggests a housing bubble,” said Blerina Uruçi, United States economist at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>. “We’ve seen very strong changes in many regions but we have to think what was the basis we started from. It was very weak in February and now is returning to normal.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday’s report showed single-family housing starts in April were at a rate of 733,000, which is 16.7 percent above the revised March figure. Starts for apartments and condominiums rose to 389,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits for new housing in April — considered a predictor of construction in months to come — were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,143,000, an increase of 10.1 percent over March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">March housing data was strong across many regions of the country but especially in the Northeast, which is where the winter storms were concentrated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the South, however, growth was not quite as strong as some economists had expected. “That is important to note because it indicates that the winter did not mask or limit a near-term acceleration in starts in the South,” David Nice, an economist at <span class="companylink">Mesirow Financial</span>, said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The South, he said, makes up about half of single-family housing starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In order to see any substantial acceleration in starts in the months to come,” Mr. Nice said, “we’ll need to see further strengthening in the South.”</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private employers in the United States added in April the smallest monthly number of workers in more than a year. And, in another report, the Labor Department found that nonfarm productivity fell in the first quarter as harsh winter weather depressed output.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Payrolls in the private sector increased by 169,000 last month, the <span class="companylink">ADP</span> National Employment Report showed, the fewest since January 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">March payrolls were revised down to show 14,000 fewer jobs created than previously reported. The report developed with <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics was released before the government's more comprehensive employment findings, which are due on Friday. Although it has a poor record of predicting nonfarm payrolls, the <span class="companylink">ADP</span> report poses a downside risk to economists' expectations for nonfarm payrolls growth of 224,000 in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its report on Wednesday, the Labor Department said labor-related production costs rose at their quickest pace in a year. Productivity declined at a 1.9 percent annual rate after dropping at a revised 2.1 pace in the fourth quarter. That was the first back-to-back fall in productivity since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that productivity, hourly output per worker, would fall at a 1.8 percent rate, dropping from a previously reported 2.2 percent rate in the last quarter of 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The productivity decrease, which mirrored the abrupt growth slowdown in the first quarter, is likely to be temporary. Still, the trend remains weak. Productivity rose 0.6 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the weather disruptions, hours worked increased at a 1.7 percent rate in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With hours outperforming a 0.2 percent pace of decline in output, unit labor costs increased at a 5 percent rate in the first quarter. That was the fastest pace since the first quarter of 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unit labor costs, the price of labor per unit of output, increased at a 4.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter. They rose 1.1 percent compared with the first quarter of 2014, a sign that wage inflation remains benign. Compensation per hour increased at a 3.1 percent rate in the first quarter, also the quickest pace since the first quarter of 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Wednesday, the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> said applications for home mortgages in the United States fell last week as interest rates jumped. Its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which tracks refinancing and home purchase demand, fell 4.6 percent in the workweek that ended Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group’s seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications fell 8.3 percent, to its lowest level since January, and the gauge of loan requests for home purchases, a leading indicator of home sales, rose 0.8 percent, to its highest level since June 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The refinance share of total mortgage activity fell to 53 percent of applications, from 55 percent the previous week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates for fixed 30-year mortgages averaged 3.93 percent in the week, up eight basis points from 3.85 percent the previous week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey covers more than 75 percent of retail residential mortgage applications in the country.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home prices in the United States climbed at a faster pace in February than the previous month, a <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index found, driven by higher sales and a limited supply of available houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 20-city home price index rose 5 percent in February from 12 months earlier, S.&amp;P. said Tuesday. That is up from a 4.5 percent pace in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faster sales most likely drove the price gain. Signed contracts to buy homes jumped in February, yet the number of Americans listing their homes for sale remains low. That has led to bidding wars in some cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are increasing at a more sustainable pace than in the last two years, when they rose at a double-digit pace for 14 straight months. Yet some economists warn that continuing increases may price many would-be buyers out of the market, particularly as pay gains remain weak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While slow and steady growth throughout the country may sound like an unambiguously good thing, some of these markets were unaffordable to begin with and are not getting any cheaper," said Patrick Newport, an economist at <span class="companylink">IHS</span> Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All 20 cities in the index reported year-over-year price gains in February. Home prices in Denver jumped 10 percent, the most of any city, followed by San Francisco with 9.8 percent. Denver is one of two cities, along with Dallas, where prices have surpassed their previous peak during the housing boom. Prices nationwide are 10 percent lower than the July 2006 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some areas may remain below their bubble peaks for years. Home prices in Las Vegas plunged nearly 62 percent during the housing bust and are still 41.5 percent below their previous peak, S.&amp;P. said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Tuesday, the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said consumer confidence in the United States fell this month to the lowest level in four months, knocked down by a slowdown in hiring. Its consumer confidence index fell to 95.2 in April from 101.4 in March, the lowest reading since 93.1 in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers' assessment of current economic conditions fell for the third straight month, and their expectations for the future fell as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lynn Franco, the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>'s director of economic indicators, blamed ''the recent lackluster performance of the labor market.'' The American economy generated just 126,000 jobs last month, breaking a 12-month streak of at least 200,000 new jobs a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers' view of the current job market deteriorated in April. Americans were also more likely to say that there would be fewer jobs and that their incomes would be lower in six months. The share saying that they planned to buy a car or a major appliance within six months fell. The decline in confidence hit all age groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also weighing on consumers' spirits were gasoline prices, which tumbled to a nationwide average low of $2.03 a gallon in late January and have bounced back up to $2.55 a gallon, according to AAA.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing homes surged in March to their highest level in 18 months as more houses came on the market, a sign of strength in housing ahead of the spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fairly upbeat report from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> on Wednesday implied the economy was regaining some momentum after hitting a speed bump at the start of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's consistent with strong growth in the second quarter. We should have a solid spring selling season and should see the housing market continuing to improve through 2015,'' said Gus Faucher, senior economist at the <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales increased 6.1 percent to an annual rate of 5.19 million units in March, the highest level since September 2013. The percentage rise was the largest since December 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outlook for the spring selling season, which runs from April through August, was also bolstered by a separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association, which showed applications for loans to purchase homes jumped 5 percent last week to the highest level since June 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the fourth time in five weeks that purchase applications rose, and economists attributed this to moves by the government to ease credit conditions for first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales have been constrained by a shortage of properties on the market, which has pushed up home prices and limited choice for potential buyers. Fewer homeowners are defaulting on their mortgages, meaning there are fewer foreclosed properties in the pipeline to lift supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As such, builders would have to break more ground to increase inventories. <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span>, the largest homebuilder in the United States, on Wednesday reported a 30 percent jump in orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, the inventory of unsold homes on the market increased 5.3 percent from a month ago to two million units, the highest level since last November. However, supply was up only 2 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors and economists say insufficient equity and uncertainty about the economy's strength were forcing potential sellers to stay longer in their homes. A recent survey by the Realtors association showed homeowners were staying in their homes for an average of 10 years instead of the typical seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At March's sales pace, it would take 4.6 months to clear houses from the market, down from 4.7 months in February. A supply of six months is viewed as a healthy balance.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Housing starts in the United States rose far less than expected in March and factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region grew modestly this month, suggesting the economy could struggle to rebound from a soft patch in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy stumbled at the start of the year under the weight of a harsh winter, a resurgent dollar, weaker global growth and a labor dispute, which has been resolved, at the West Coast ports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are expectations that growth will rebound in the second quarter, but the lukewarm data on Thursday suggested the momentum would probably not be strong enough for the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> to start raising interest rates before September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The economy's tepid recovery in March makes it very unlikely the Fed signals a June rate hike at the April meeting,'' said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research in New York. ''If housing doesn't recover enough this spring, a September rate hike likely becomes equally improbable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Groundbreaking increased 2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 926,000 units, the Commerce Department said Thursday. That left the bulk of February's decline, which had been attributed to bad weather, intact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While starts for single-family homes rose, the gains made only a small dent in the losses of the previous two months. Groundbreaking for the multifamily segment fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though permits for future home construction declined 5.7 percent to a 1.04 million-unit pace, March was the eighth straight month that they remained above the one million-unit pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the <span class="companylink">Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank</span> said its business activity index rose to 7.5 this month, from 5.0 in March. A measure of orders for manufactured goods fell to its lowest level since May 2013, while shipments remained in contraction territory despite some improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Combined, the April reports are not signaling that manufacturing activity is picking up significantly following the weak first quarter,'' said Daniel Silver, an economist at <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing has been hit hard by the dollar's 13 percent appreciation against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since last June, as well as the softer overseas demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the recent weakness, the outlook for housing remains favorable against the backdrop of a strengthening labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a separate report on Thursday from the Labor Department showed a rise in the number of people seeking unemployment aid last week, the underlying trend continued to suggest the jobs market is tightening as more long-term unemployed people find work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 294,000 for the week that ended April 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But claims tend to be volatile around this time of the year because moving holidays like Easter and the school spring break can throw off the model that the government uses to smooth the data for seasonal fluctuations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose only marginally and remained well below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strengthening labor market, for a third straight week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of people still receiving unemployment benefits after an initial week was the lowest since December 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We continue to view claims data as reflective of overall improvement in labor markets,'' said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> in New York.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Many Home Equity Loans Are Facing a Reset Point</span>
</div><div class="author">By ANN CARRNS   </div><div>794 words</div><div>15 April 2015</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>The New York Times on the Web</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade ago, when home values were soaring, many homeowners financed all sorts of spending using home equity lines of credit, often borrowed in addition to a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of these credit lines have a 10-year draw period, during which borrowers may use the money as needed and make interest-only payments. After the draw period, the loans typically become regular installment loans, with terms of 10 to 20 years -- meaning the principal must be repaid as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, many borrowers face what could be a significant increase in monthly payments this year or during the next several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maria Giordano, a onetime trauma nurse who is now a full-time real estate investor in Phoenix, says she expects the $400 monthly payment on the equity line of credit on her suburban home to nearly double after the loan resets in 2017. She took out the loan in 2007, she says, to pay for renovations and a new patio. She was reluctant to sell the house after the real estate downturn, but has decided to put it on the market now and pay off the debt, since property values have rebounded enough to create significant equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For borrowers like Ms. Giordano who have equity in their homes, the looming reset is less threatening than it might be. If they don't want to sell, but have good credit, they can try to refinance the loan at current interest rates, which are now quite low, either as a new line of credit or as part of an overall refinancing package that replaces their first mortgage and home equity line with a single home loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Daren Blomquist, vice president of RealtyTrac, which compiles housing data, says not everyone will be so fortunate. RealtyTrac recently estimated that about 3.3 million home equity credit lines totaling $158 billion and originating between 2005 and 2008 were still open and were scheduled to reset between 2015 and 2018. For those loans, the average increase in monthly payments was estimated to range from $138 for loans resetting in 2016 to $161 for those in 2018. More than half -- about 1.8 million loans -- were on homes that were seriously underwater, meaning the borrower owed more in total debt than the home is worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For underwater borrowers, refinancing may be difficult -- especially if they have less-than-stellar credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just how significant a problem this will be is a subject of debate. Housing prices have rebounded over the last several years and the jobless rate has fallen, putting many consumers on better financial footing. For those reasons, Greg McBride, senior analyst with Bankrate, said he did not see widespread economic risk from the coming resets. Still, he said, ''that's little consolation to those who see their payments increase and don't have the money to handle it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marietta Rodriguez, vice president for national homeownership programs at <span class="companylink">NeighborWorks America</span>, a nonprofit, says problems with the resets have not emerged as a significant issue yet, although that could change over the next two years as draw periods end for more loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some questions about home equity lines of credit:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; How will I know when my line of credit is due to reset?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many banks, with urging from federal regulators, are notifying borrowers a year or more in advance of their reset period, to fend off potential surprises. <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, for instance, is notifying customers 24 months ahead of the ''end of draw'' phase, so borrowers can plan ahead. If you haven't received a notice and are unsure of the reset date, you can contact your lender and ask.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; Can I do anything ahead of time, to prepare for the reset period?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas Robinson, a spokesman for NeighborWorks, suggests making sure your credit profile is in good shape, so that if you do need to refinance you will be in the best position possible to secure a new loan at a competitive rate. If you need help understanding the terms of your loan, talking to a housing counselor may help. You can search by ZIP code for counselors approved by the federal Housing and Urban Development Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; What if I am worried about making the higher payment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You should contact your lender to ask about options, like extending the loan repayment period. You will ultimately pay more interest with an extended term, but your monthly payments will be more manageable. Home equity lines are often held by the original lender, rather than sold to investors, which means the bank may have more flexibility to adjust the terms of the loan, Mr. Blomquist said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks and bonds ended the first three months of 2015 little changed, leveling off from the steep rise of recent years and raising questions about the road ahead. The stall coincided with signs of flagging momentum in economic growth and corporate earnings and an assortment of foreign developments that threatened to derail the markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One asset rose substantially, reaching a 12-year high. That was the dollar, which rose 9 percent against a standard basket of currencies of American trading partners. Its ascent was partly driven by a standoff between financially feeble Greece and its European creditors that could force Greece out of the euro. The dollar was also propelled by an event that for years has seemed a few months away: an increase in the federal funds rate, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s main short-term interest rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As expected, the Fed last month dropped its pledge to be patient about raising the rate, wording it had used consistently in its policy statements. But the rest of the March statement made clear that the central bank was in no hurry to raise the near-zero percent rate until the economy perks up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apparent belief among investors that the Fed was still on their side and that economic indicators were not working against them was enough to send the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index up, but barely: It rose less than 0.5 percent in the first quarter, to 2,067.89. Bond prices rose too, reducing the yield on the 10-year Treasury to 1.93 percent from 2.17 percent. Yields on high- and low-quality corporate instruments also fell, although less so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tacit assurances that no rate increase was imminent have long supported stocks and bonds, but concern is growing that the Fed may have painted itself into a corner. A rate increase could provoke turbulence in the markets, investment advisers warn, but continuing to delay could raise concern about the fragility of the markets, the economic recovery or both. Investors who have cheered the Fed's dovishness could be the ones whose patience is tested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The market believes the Fed doesn't have the capacity to raise rates, and that's not a healthy thing,'' said Jonathan Golub, chief United States market strategist at <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span>. ''They don't want to be at zero, but they don't want to remove accommodation in a way that's disruptive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But given the Fed's desire to normalize policy, investors would be better off pondering ''what the Fed's pace will be and how far they go,'' rather than obsessing over when rates will start rising, Mr. Golub said. He predicted that ''whatever they do, they're going to do it really, really slowly,'' bringing Fed funds to about 1.75 percent by the end of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How successful the Fed has been in dragging the economy out of recession and financial turmoil is debatable. Joblessness has continued to trend lower, at least until a report released early this month showed much fewer net jobs created in March than expected, but wage growth has been sluggish and indicators of the housing market and consumer spending have been weak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each of the last three Census Bureau monthly reports on retail sales has shown a decline. The pace of home sales reported by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> for January and February was lower than for any month since last April, as was the average price of previously owned single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GDPNow, a running estimate of economic growth posted on the website of the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta</span>, showed no change in gross domestic product in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate profits have hit a rough patch, too. Earnings for the companies in the S.&amp;P. 500 are estimated by <span class="companylink">FactSet Research Systems</span> to be 4.7 percent lower in the first quarter than the period last year. For all of 2015, FactSet forecasts a 2.3 percent increase, less than half the 4.9 percent gain last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fund returns in the first quarter were mediocre, in line with economic and corporate performance. The average domestic stock fund in Morningstar's database rose 2.6 percent, led by portfolios that focus on health care and consumer discretionary items, the sector that includes retailers, carmakers and travel companies. Funds that hold energy stocks were conspicuously weak, losing 2 percent, as the prices of oil and natural gas continued the plunges that began last June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy companies account for much of the decline in earnings estimates. Leaving that sector out, Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citi Research, found economic and corporate conditions satisfactory. Credit is still expanding, he said, manufacturing capacity is tight, and capital spending, excluding energy industries, is expected to rise 5 percent this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHETHER the economy is doing well, poorly or so-so, there is a consensus that the United States is faring better than most of the rest of the world. Even so, foreign stock markets and funds that invest in them outperformed. The average international stock fund returned 3.4 percent, with funds that focus on Japan doing exceptionally well, up 12 percent. European funds rose 4.9 percent, while Latin American funds dropped 8.9 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Funds that focus on India were notably strong performers, rising 8.4 percent. With many emerging markets facing difficulties, including high debt, weak currencies and slow global growth, India is ''one shiny standout,'' said Elizabeth R. Morrissey, managing partner of Kleiman International Consultants. She credits success there, which she predicts will continue, to a package of business-friendly changes made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the other end of the spectrum is Brazil. Ms. Morrissey described its fortunes as ''way scarier than others'' because of the strong dollar, collapsing commodity prices, high inflation and a corruption scandal at <span class="companylink">Petrobras</span>, the national oil company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The government has been in office three months, and people are already taking to the streets,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rising dollar has had a more benign effect elsewhere. Investment advisers attribute much of the strength in foreign stocks and the dollar to a single catalyst: diverging monetary policies. <span class="companylink">The Fed</span> may be taking its time to turn hawkish, but few foreign central banks are even contemplating it and several are going in the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> started a program of bond purchases in the first quarter, the <span class="companylink">Bank of Japan</span> continues to buy bonds, and the <span class="companylink">People's Bank of China</span> is expected to do the same soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These moves have helped make many foreign stocks more appealing. The most recent edition of <span class="companylink">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span>'s survey of global fund managers, released in mid-March, found managers with the greatest underweight position in American stocks, versus the rest of the world, since early 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Fed that is more hawkish than other central banks bolsters the dollar by keeping yields comparatively high on American bonds, enticing foreigners to buy them and, therefore, the dollar. But yields just about everywhere are historically low, perhaps perilously so, and prices are very high, said Joel Beam, manager of the Forward Select Opportunity fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm extremely carefully positioned and selling into strength anything that seems overpriced,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond investors escaped the first quarter mostly unscathed. The average fund was up 1.3 percent, with portfolios that specialize in long-term issues rising 3.2 percent. Two categories of funds that hold foreign bonds -- world bond and emerging-market bond -- were barely changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Beam prefers stocks, with reservations. ''The stock landscape is pretty expensive, but people have to be thinking about having more equities in their life for the next five years,'' he said. ''Rather than buy fixed income and get slaughtered, buy a good bank.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for where to seek such a bank or other stock, he suggests Europe, which he considers to be in the early stages of a ''robust healing process.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Europe is on the mend, investment advisers credit the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span>. Ms. Morrissey believes that the bond purchase program, or quantitative easing, has immunized other weak eurozone economies from danger should Greece leave the currency bloc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mr. Draghi saved the day,'' she said, referring to Mario Draghi, the head of the bank. ''I would expect'' the prospect of a Greek exit ''to have an impact on Italy, but with Q.E. it hasn't. The rest of the union will probably hold together.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Greece itself, Ms. Morrissey rates the odds slightly better than even that it will remain in the euro. It is uncertain whether ''they have the cash to survive,'' she acknowledged, ''but it seems the new Greek government really understands the severity of their situation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Effusive praise for European policy makers is one reason Mr. Levkovich, the Citi Research equity strategist, prefers American stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everyone loves Europe,'' he said. ''That tells me they've bought it already.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judging by the tripling of the S.&amp;P. 500 in six years, a lot of investors have bought American stocks, too. He predicted further gains, but only about 7 percent this year. He recommended niches like retailing, financial services and parts of technology like infrastructure and security, and he said he would avoid health care and the bond market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Golub, of <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span>, also favored American stocks, and was cautious in his optimism. ''The weight of evidence suggests the next six to 12 months look pretty safe,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He warned that it was hard to know how to invest when investors and the Fed itself would prefer a reversion to normal monetary policy but are afraid of the first rate increase that would signal its arrival.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're in a bizarro land,'' Mr. Golub said. ''The way investors are thinking is abnormal, but it's logical.''</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Construction Spending Dips Again, Affecting Overall Growth</span>
</div><div class="author">By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS   </div><div>789 words</div><div>2 April 2015</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>The New York Times on the Web</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Construction spending in the United States slipped in February, pulled down by a drop in single-family home building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seasonally adjusted construction spending fell 0.1 percent in February after a revised 1.7 percent drop in January, the Commerce Department reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result in part reflects bitter winter weather that constrained construction in many parts of the country during the month. It also joined a series of mostly discouraging economic reports, including on manufacturing and jobs, that weighed down the stock market on Wednesday and stoked concerns about corporate profits and global growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts are hopeful over all for a rebound in construction spending as the economy strengthens in the spring and summer. Still, economists at <span class="companylink">IHS</span> Global Insight called February's numbers ''another poor report'' and said in a research note that sluggish construction spending was likely to pull down overall economic growth for the first quarter of 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Wednesday's report, private spending on construction of single-family homes declined 1.4 percent -- the biggest drop since 2010, noted Gregory Daco, head of United States macroeconomics at Oxford Economics. Spending on apartments was up 4.1 percent. Nonresidential construction spending rose 0.5 percent, led by a 5 percent jump in hotel construction and a 6.8 percent surge in factory construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total private construction spending, which rose 0.2 percent, was offset by a 0.8 percent retreat in public construction spending. State and local governments cut spending by 1.6 percent. They account for more than 90 percent of government spending on construction. The federal government increased construction spending by 9 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall construction spending was up 2.1 percent from February 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers, said factories in the United States expanded last month at a weaker pace as orders grew more slowly and hiring was essentially flat. The group reported that its manufacturing index slipped to 51.5 in March from 52.9 in February. It was the fifth straight drop. Still, any reading above 50 signals expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Domestic manufacturers have faced a drag in recent months from falling oil prices, a rising dollar and winter storms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Ashworth, chief North American economist at Capital Economics, said that the slowdown wasn't ''alarming'' because nonmanufacturing companies still appear to be faring well. And there is the expectation that manufacturing will rebound as the impact of the winter weather fades. Production improved slightly between February and March, a sign that growth may accelerate in the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're well positioned for the distinct possibility of an uptick, an upswing, in momentum as we go forward, not unlike last year,'' which also started with a particularly harsh winter, noted Bradley Holcomb, chairman of I.S.M.'s manufacturing business survey committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Out of 18 manufacturing industries, 10 reported growth and seven reported an outright decline in March. Among the sectors that declined were apparel, textiles, petroleum and coal, electrical equipment, plastics and rubber products, and furniture. ''In balance, we're still positive,'' Mr. Holcomb said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Wednesday, the payroll processor <span class="companylink">ADP</span> said companies added a seasonally adjusted 189,000 jobs last month. That's the first month of gains under 200,000 jobs in 13 months, and it's a decline from the 214,000 jobs added in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Job growth took a step back in March,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics, which analyzed the survey data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government's report on jobs will be released on Friday, and economists are forecasting an increase of 250,000 jobs. The <span class="companylink">ADP</span> numbers cover only private businesses and sometimes diverge from the government's more comprehensive report, which includes government agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several economists say that the <span class="companylink">ADP</span> survey can be an unreliable indicator of the government jobs report. ''<span class="companylink">ADP</span> is far from infallible,'' said Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few economists responded to the March setback by changing their yearly forecasts, including Mr. Zandi of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He still expects consumer spending to rebound and the economy to add jobs at an average monthly pace of 250,000, or three million for the year. This would represent a solid improvement in the job market, although it would be less spectacular than the last four months, when monthly gains averaged 321,500 jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A burst of hiring in the last year has lifted the number of Americans earning paychecks. But average hourly wages have risen at a sluggish 2 percent pace, possibly making many Americans hesitant to spend their savings from cheaper oil and gasoline.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — Home prices continued to rise at a steady pace in January, as the American housing market deals with affordability problems and few properties listed for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> /Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose 4.6 percent in January compared with 12 months earlier, S.&amp;P. said on Tuesday. That is up from growth of 4.4 percent in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few Americans have listed their homes for sale, and the tight inventory is keeping prices higher. Robust hiring and low mortgage rates have raised the possibility of stronger sales, yet home prices have appreciated at a significantly faster pace than earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home prices are rising roughly twice as fast as wages, putting pressure on potential home buyers and heightening the risk that any uptick in interest rates could be a major setback," said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee for S.&amp;P. <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> Indices</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller index covers roughly half the homes nationwide. The index measures prices compared with those in January 2000 and creates a three-month moving average. The January figures are the latest available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing inventories have been tight since December. The number of homes for sale in February was equal to just 4.6 months of sales, compared with an average of 5.2 months last year. Six months of supply is typical for a healthy housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All 20 cities reported higher prices than a year earlier. Denver reported the largest gains, with prices up 8.4 percent. Miami prices jumped by 8.3 percent, and Dallas homes appreciated at 8.1 percent. Home appreciation nearly plateaued in Washington, where prices rose just 1.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically low mortgage rates and solid hiring have laid the foundation for stronger sales this year. Average 30-year fixed rates were 3.69 percent last week, according to the mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> . The average has plummeted from a 52-week high of 4.41 percent, making it cheaper for would-be homeowners to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, employers have added 3.3 million jobs over the last 12 months, including 295,000 jobs in February. The hiring spree pace has caused the unemployment rate to drop to 5.5 percent from 6.7 percent. As more people in the economy hold jobs, more paychecks exist to finance home purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Tuesday, the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said its consumer confidence index rose in March, after a dip in February, thanks to the improving job market. The index rose to 101.3, from a revised 98.8 reading in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confidence has risen to the highest levels since before the recession started in December 2007. A year ago, the index stood at 83.9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">”The strength of confidence, along with improving labor market conditions, indicates that real consumption growth will accelerate over the coming months,” Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> is a private business group that takes into account expectations for the future and consumers’ assessment of current conditions for its index. Consumers were more optimistic about the future but a little less impressed with current economic conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confidence rose for those younger than 35 and 55 or older. It fell for Americans 35 to 54.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Encouraging economic data in the United States and a batch of corporate deals put investors in a buying mood on Monday, sending stocks sharply higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broad rally nudged the <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average back into positive territory for the year after a rough stretch for the market most of last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders welcomed a government report showing that consumer spending and incomes rose in February. Another report hinted at a strong start to the spring buying season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy stocks were among the biggest gainers, bucking a slide in the price of crude oil. Several drug makers soared on merger news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You had all the elements today for a positive market,'' said Quincy Krosby, market strategist for <span class="companylink">Prudential Financial</span> .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow</span> rose 263.65 points, or 1.5 percent, to 17,976.31. The index was up as much as 295 points. It is now up 0.9 percent for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index rose 25.22 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,086.24, while the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> gained 56.22 points, or 1.2 percent, to 4,947.44. Both indexes are also up for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have their eye on economic data as they look ahead to the next round of corporate earnings, beginning next week. While a clutch of weaker-than-expected data sent the market lower much of last week, positive economic news got Monday's rally going early.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Europe, a survey from the <span class="companylink">European Commission</span> showed that economic sentiment across the 19-country eurozone was at its highest level since July 2011. Chinese stocks soared on hopes of more economic stimulus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the United States, the government said that consumer spending edged up 0.1 percent in February after two straight monthly declines, while consumers' incomes rose a solid 0.4 percent. With income growing faster than spending, the saving rate jumped to 5.8 percent of after-tax income -- the highest level since December 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists hope the bigger paychecks will give spending a greater boost in the coming months. And there were signs that was already happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported that its index of pending home sales rose to its highest level since June 2013. The upturn suggests a solid spring sales rebound after a lackluster winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Today's data suggest that the economy is going to be stronger in the next quarter starting in April,'' said Ms. Krosby of <span class="companylink">Prudential Financial</span> .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also helping the market were continuing expectations that any increase in the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s key interest rate this year would come in steps. On Friday, the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said in a speech that continued improvement in the American economy meant an increase in the Fed's key interest rate could come later this year, but would most likely be gradual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Erik Davidson, chief investment officer for <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> Private Bank, said, ''The market takes some confidence in that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, the 10 sectors in the S.&amp;P. 500 rose, with energy stocks notching the biggest gain. The sector rose 2.1 percent. It is still down 2.7 percent for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Analog Devices</span> led all stocks in the S.&amp;P. 500, climbing $5.97, or 10.2 percent, to $64.81.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The insurer <span class="companylink">UnitedHealth Group</span> jumped 2.5 percent after it agreed to buy the pharmacy benefits manager Catamaran. Shares in <span class="companylink">UnitedHealth Group</span> added $2.99 to close at $121. Catamaran vaulted 23.8 percent, adding $11.51, to $59.83.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Auspex Pharmaceuticals</span> soared 41.5 percent after it agreed to be acquired by <span class="companylink">Teva Pharmaceutical Industries</span> for about $3.2 billion in cash. Auspex gained $29.45, closing at $100.36.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horizon Pharma climbed 18.2 percent on news it is buying <span class="companylink">Hyperion Therapeutics</span> for $1.1 billion. Horizon gained $3.97, to $25.78. <span class="companylink">Hyperion</span> added $3.24, or 7.6 percent, to $45.98.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of oil fell slightly before the deadline Tuesday for negotiators to reach a general agreement to curb Iran's nuclear program in exchange for an easing of sanctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it appears that more Iranian crude could eventually come on the market, prices could fall. United States oil fell 19 cents, to $48.68 a barrel. Brent crude, a benchmark for many international oils imported by American refineries, slipped 12 cents, to $56.29 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other futures trading, wholesale gasoline was unchanged at $1.80 a gallon; heating oil was unchanged at $1.73 a gallon; and natural gas rose 0.5 cent to $2.644 per 1,000 cubic feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Precious and industrial metals futures closed mixed. Gold fell $15, to $1,184.80 an ounce; silver fell 40 cents, to $16.67 an ounce; and copper edged up a penny, to $2.78 a pound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United States government bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged down to 1.95 percent from 1.96 percent late Friday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Consumers spent just slightly more in February even though their income rose by a healthy amount, the Commerce Department reported on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But economists hope the bigger paychecks will give spending a greater boost in the coming months. And there were signs that a jump was already underway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report showed that more Americans signed contracts to buy homes in February, evidence that the spring buying season could open strong after sluggish sales for much of the winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending edged up 0.1 percent after declines of 0.2 percent in both January and December, the Commerce Department reported Monday. The result reflected a 0.4 percent increase in spending on nondurable goods, like food and energy, coupled with a 0.1 percent fall in durable goods like automobiles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Income grew 0.4 percent in February, matching January's rise. With income growing faster than spending, the saving rate jumped to 5.8 percent of after-tax income -- the highest level since December 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the rise in the saving rate reflected in part the big drop in gasoline prices in recent months, which leaves more money in consumers' pockets. Falling gas prices and continued growth in employment set the stage for stronger consumer spending in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Households are still flush with the money saved from the big drop-off in gasoline prices and, with the labor market still on fire, incomes should continue to increase at a solid pace,'' said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics. ''That provides the scope for a big gain in consumption in the second quarter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Severe winter weather kept shoppers away from malls and auto showrooms in both January and February. The weather-related weakness is expected to dampen overall economic growth during the January-March quarter, with many economists forecasting growth to slow to around 1.5 percent during the quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But analysts are also optimistic for a rebound in coming quarters to growth of 3 percent or better. If the economy does hit 3 percent growth this year, it would be the fastest pace for the economy in a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robust employment gains of the past year should continue this year, and the stronger job market will most likely lead to rising household incomes and more consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the housing report, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said that its seasonally adjusted pending home sales index climbed 3.1 percent to 106.9 last month, the highest reading since June 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales are a barometer of future purchases. A one- to two-month lag usually exists between a contract and a completed sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upturn suggests a solid spring sales rebound after a lackluster winter. But unlike last year when sales fell, the spring buying season opens after more than a year of economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What's different this time is that the surge in the pace of payroll growth means that the pool of prospective home buyers is now rising more rapidly than at any time since the crash,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While existing home sales are up nearly 5 percent from last year, economists say activity would likely be more brisk if it weren't for the negative equity overhang that has lately worsened in many markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Completed sales on existing homes rose 4.7 percent in February compared with a year ago, reaching an annual rate of 4.88 million, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, a 1.2 percent increase over January. But Mark Fleming, the chief economist at <span class="companylink">First American Financial Corporation</span>, a national provider of title insurance and settlement services, says his research tells him that home sales ought to be even higher. The labor market has improved considerably. And home prices are higher, which, though it may sound counterintuitive, have historically correlated with rising home sales, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Rising prices only crimp affordability for the first-time buyer who doesn't yet own the asset,'' Mr. Fleming said. ''But the vast majority of home sales are to existing homeowners. And for existing homeowners, what changes affordability is their own income and the price of money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both of these factors are running in homeowners' favor. The problem, though, is that many are still unable to participate in the housing market because of insufficient equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Negative equity -- owing more on your mortgage than your home is worth -- is obviously a ''huge impediment'' for homeowners looking to move. Mr. Fleming said that levels of equity below 20 percent also act as a disincentive to sell because homeowners have to be able to cover costs associated with the transaction. Stan Humphries, the chief economist at Zillow, the real estate listing and information site, estimated that around 35 percent of homeowners nationwide are essentially locked out of the housing market because of either negative equity or equity below 20 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of homeowners underwater has, in fact, declined dramatically from the 2011 peak of 31 percent. As of the fourth quarter of 2014, the national rate was closer to 17 percent, according to Mr. Humphries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A big part of that is because of robust home value appreciation in the last three-plus years,'' Mr. Humphries said. But he emphasized that the decline in underwater homeowners is ''now slowing as the housing cycle matures. As price gains moderate, the pace at which we work out negative equity slows down.'' By the end of 2015, the share of homes with negative equity will likely still be above 15 percent, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow's 2014 fourth-quarter negative equity report even shows rising negative equity levels in 21 of the top 50 housing markets, compared with the third quarter. The reason is that the bottom 10 percent of homes in these markets, where negative equity is highly concentrated, are declining in value, Mr. Humphries said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners in the bottom one-third of housing stock by price are three times as likely to be underwater than homeowners in the top third, Mr. Humphries said. What's more, the Zillow report found, they are also far more likely to be deeply underwater, or owing at least twice what their home is worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The metropolitan areas with the highest rates of negative equity were Virginia Beach, Va. (28.3 percent); Jacksonville, Fla. (27); Las Vegas (26.4) and Atlanta (26.1). These are all areas that showed the steepest drops in home values after the housing market crash and therefore are taking a longer time to recover, according to Mr. Humphries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the New York area, 13 percent of owner-occupied homes had a mortgage in negative equity. These homeowners were underwater by an average of $125,550, compared with $67,797 nationally.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A FOUR-BEDROOM HOUSE WITH VIEWS OF JUNGLE AND OCEAN</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$2,390,000</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This three-story modern home resembles a treehouse, nestled into the jungle three miles from 1,700-acre Manuel Antonio National Park, one of Costa Rica's biggest tourist attractions. The house, built in 2002, was one of the first completed in Tulemar, a 33-acre gated community a short walk from a secluded beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The living area in the steel-frame house encompasses about 5,000 square feet, including covered balconies. There are four bedrooms and five bathrooms, with wide terraces accessible from almost every room and offering views of the Pacific Ocean. The front door leads to an open-design living area, dining area and kitchen. The flooring is ceramic tile. The furniture is included in the price. The kitchen has granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, a pantry and large windows with ocean views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large windows frame the living area, offering unobstructed jungle and ocean views. It has overhead fans, but no air-conditioning, a common arrangement in Costa Rica. (There are air-conditioning units in the bedrooms.) Outside is a long open-air deck with a narrow plunge pool. Monkeys, sloths and exotic birds are regular visitors, according to Dave Houck, an owner of Tulemar Vacation Home Rentals and Sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top floor, accessible by a floating wood staircase, has two master bedroom suites and an office. One master bedroom features a bathroom with twin sinks and a whirlpool bathtub; the bathroom off the other bedroom has a shower with a glass door leading to the balcony. The office has a built-in wood desk and storage space; Wi-Fi is available throughout the house. All the rooms on this level access wide terraces with jungle and ocean views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The remaining two bedrooms are on the bottom floor, each with its own bathroom, tile shower and deck. The two lower bedrooms also share a small kitchenette with a refrigerator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house sits on a lot of about two-thirds of an acre, which includes a wide, flat grassy area that has been used as a croquet court. There is no garage, but there is a storage area under the house, Mr. Houck said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the Tulemar development, 45 homes have been completed. Amenities include two restaurants, four pools, resort shuttles and a concierge service. The homeowners' association fee is $600 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tulemar is off a narrow, winding, two-lane mountain road, about halfway between the small fishing town of Quepos and the national park. It is within walking distance of a cluster of restaurants, open-air bars and a small market. Most people reach the area by driving from San José, which takes about four hours, or by flying into Quepos on one of the small Costa Rica airlines, which is a 25-minute trip. The house has been on the market for several months, but the price has not been lowered and the owners are in no rush to sell, Mr. Houck said. They rent it out for most of the year, typically for $6,500 a week during high season, from January to April, and as high as $13,000 a week during Christmas and New Year's, Mr. Houck said. ''There is a very strong following of repeat guests,'' Mr. Houck said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARKET OVERVIEW</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no multiple listing service or central database in Costa Rica, making it difficult to find accurate information on sales and pricing. When the international second home market stalled in 2008, sales in the Manuel Antonio area slowed to a trickle and prices dropped 20 to 30 percent, according to agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But activity has been picking up in the past year. ''We're definitely having an uptick in sales,'' said Shawn Ferguson, co-owner of the <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker</span> office in Manuel Antonio and Quepos, a real estate agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market is very dependent on the United States economy, which generates the largest group of buyers. ''We're probably six to eight months behind the U.S.,'' Mr. Ferguson said. ''As the U.S. heads up, so do we.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bulk of recent activity involves bargain homes priced below $350,000 and luxury properties priced over $800,000, according to agents. Investors are primarily interested in the higher-end villas to rent to tourists as vacation homes. ''Less than $800,000 and they are not going to get the amenities they need'' for a prime rental, Mr. Ferguson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the original lots in Tulemar have been sold, but typically there are five to seven homes and lots available on the resale market, Mr. Houck said. When the market collapsed, Tulemar ''didn't sell as many properties, but prices didn't drop,'' Mr. Houck said. The least expensive home on the market there is a three-bedroom, 3,000-square-foot home for $799,000. A one-bedroom, 700-square-foot bungalow recently sold for $435,000, Mr. Houck said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHO BUYS IN COSTA RICA</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Americans looking for a second home or a tropical investment property dominate the Costa Rica market, according to agents. The largest number of buyers comes from the West Coast of the United States, with Canadians a close second. Air connections from Europe are slowly improving, bringing more tourists from Italy, Germany and Britain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Costa Rica is famous for attracting ecotourists and buyers drawn by its lush landscape and natural beauty. It is also one of the favorite destinations in the region for retirees. The country offers a pensionado visa program with a wide range of discounts and tax breaks for anyone who moves to Costa Rica and can show a minimal income from Social Security or a pension plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers from around Latin America, including from Colombia and Venezuela, are playing an increasing role, Mr. Ferguson said. His company is changing its marketing strategy to attract more buyers from the region, including a growing class of affluent Costa Rican buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUYING BASICS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are few restrictions on foreigners buying property. ''Foreigners have exactly the same rights as a Costa Rican when it comes to buying property,'' said Roger Petersen, a San José-based lawyer who works with property buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only twist involves waterfront property, known as the maritime zone, which is tightly regulated by the Costa Rican government. It can be difficult for a foreigner to buy land in the maritime zone, which extends about 200 meters from the high-tide line, and building or renovating a property can be a complicated process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Anybody considering investing in properties in the maritime zone needs to do a more extensive due diligence,'' Mr. Petersen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transactions are typically carried out in dollars, and most purchases by foreigners are in cash. Mortgages are difficult for nonresidents to obtain in Costa Rica. Transfer deeds to record the transfer of title must be done in Spanish; purchase agreements are often translated into English, but buyers should carefully review the translation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is mandatory to use a notary public to complete and record the transaction -- all notaries are also lawyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents recommend that buyers hire their own lawyer, who represents their interests exclusively, with no ties to the seller.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LANGUAGES AND CURRENCIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spanish; colón (1 colón = $0.0019), with the United States dollar widely accepted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TAXES AND FEES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transaction fees for a purchase typically total about 3.5 percent of its value, Mr. Petersen said. Although the buyer usually pays the fees, sometimes sellers may agree to split the costs to close a deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property taxes are calculated as 0.25 percent of the tax value of the property. In 2009, the government implemented a ''luxury'' tax on homes with a construction value of more than about $250,000 (on the structure, not including the land). The formula is complicated, but typically adds another 0.25 percent, Mr. Petersen said. There is no capital gains tax for individual sellers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In real estate, the spring selling season is something of a misnomer. It gets underway around now and lasts until back-to-school season in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means there is plenty of time for the housing market to recover if sales get off to a slow start in March. Alternatively, there is plenty of time for housing to propel the economy forward if the season goes gangbusters. Which is it likely to be? Data released this week on existing home sales [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/24/business/sales-of-existing-homes-rose-1-2-in-february.html] in February showed only a weak tailwind coming into March, while data on new home sales [http://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf] last month showed an upsurge to the highest level in seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only time will sort out the conflicting signals. Meanwhile, the mixed signs are sending a message in and of themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The immediate culprit for relatively weak existing home sales is affordability. Prices for existing homes are rising because the inventory is tight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That raises a question, however: Why have higher prices and fewer choices outweighed the potential boost to sales from low mortgage rates and increased employment among 25 to 34 year olds who can generally be counted on to be first-time buyers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among buyers, one answer is that while more young adults are working, wage growth is still lagging and student loan burdens are high. First time buyers accounted for only 29 percent of home sales last month, still below the roughly 40 percent share that is generally the case in a strong housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among sellers, some who suffered losses in the bust still have not built up enough equity to make selling their homes worthwhile. Homeowners also tend to stay put when they have doubts about the economy’s prospects. On average, homeowners are now staying in their homes for 10 years instead of 7, according to a recent survey by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dynamic in the new home market is different. For new homes, prices have trended down in the past year as homebuilders, who overbuilt in 2014, have sold off those properties. As inventory tightens, builders will likely build more and can tailor their offerings to demand in the market. Assuming potential buyers have the financial wherewithal to make home purchases, the start of a sustained upswing could be at hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for now, the February new-home sales data look a little too good: Economists had forecast a month to month drop in new home sales in February; instead, sales exceeded both January’s tally and expectations, leaving open the possibility that the result is something of a fluke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing is sure: It is unfortunate that in the spring of 2015, the housing recovery is still uncertain. Conditions did not have to be precarious for so long. But the opportunity to provide fiscal support to job seekers and homeowners was squandered in the aftermath of the recession in favor of ill advised federal budget cuts. Instead of accelerating the economic healing process, government policy slowed it down. Congressional foot dragging continues today around a litany of policies [http://www.epi.org/pay-agenda/] that could boost wages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are good reasons to believe that the spring selling season will be a success. There are reasons to fear it will not be. In the absence of appropriate economic policies, hoping for the best and guessing at the future will have to suffice.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of previously owned homes in the United States rebounded modestly in February against the backdrop of a persistent shortage of properties on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sluggish home sales are another sign that economic activity slowed sharply in the first quarter, and the current lack of inventory could undermine the spring selling season. Slow home sales could further diminish expectations that the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> will increase interest rates in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Part of the problem is that buyers don't have a lot of choice. <span class="companylink">The Fed</span> singled out housing as a sector that remains slow, and it still is, but that doesn't mean the Fed shouldn't hike rates,'' said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Monday that sales of used homes rose 1.2 percent last month to an annual rate of 4.88 million units. That failed to reverse January's 4.9 percent drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had forecast home resales rising to a pace of 4.90 million units last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight inventories are hurting sales by raising home prices and limiting the selection of houses available to potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a previously owned home was 7.5 percent higher than a year ago. That was the largest percentage gain since February 2014 and suggested that the pace of home price increases, which had been slowing after double-digit growth for much of 2013, appeared to be re-accelerating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is helping to sideline first-time buyers despite a firming labor market and government steps to ease credit conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers accounted for 29 percent of transactions last month, well below the 40 to 45 percent share that economists and real estate agents say is required for a strong housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, the inventory of unsold homes on the market rose 1.6 percent, to 1.89 million units. Supply was, however, down 0.5 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory growth should be averaging about 5.6 percent at this time of the year, when the market gets ready for the spring selling season, which runs April to August and is traditionally the busiest time of the year for housing, according to the Realtors association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The next couple months are some of the most critical of the entire year for housing, and sluggish numbers may continue if inventory doesn't increase,'' said Bill Banfield, vice president for Quicken Loans in Detroit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors and economists say insufficient equity and uncertainty about the economy's strength were forcing potential sellers to stay longer in their homes. A recent survey by the Realtors association showed homeowners on average staying in their homes for 10 years instead of the typical seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At February's sales pace, it would take 4.6 months to clear houses from the market, unchanged for a second consecutive month. A supply of six months is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apart from tight supply, sales last month were also constrained by harsh winter weather. Sales in the Northeast, which was hit by storms for much of the winter, tumbled 6.5 percent last month. Sales in the Midwest were unchanged. Sales rose in the South and West.</p>

</div><div class="author">By LISA PREVOST   </div><div>646 words</div><div>22 March 2015</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage amounts are rising more quickly than home prices, an unusual phenomenon that seems to confirm continued weakness at the lower end of the housing market, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade association reports that the average size of purchase loans began to outpace the recovery in home prices in September 2011. By December 2014, according to the group's weekly mortgage application survey, the average purchase loan amount had risen by nearly 32 percent. The average for the week ending March 6 was $294,900, a record high. In other words, the average purchase loan now exceeds levels reached before the recession when home prices soared to unsustainable heights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, the association noted, a <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> index that measures home purchase prices shows a considerably more gradual rise of 18.5 percent since 2011. Why this unusual parting of the two trend lines? Lynn M. Fisher, the association's vice president for research and economics, said one possible explanation is that home prices are rising more quickly for larger homes, skewing the loan average upward. But more likely, she said, is that the bulk of the properties being sold are at the high end of the price range. ''The mix of people buying is changing,'' Dr. Fisher said. ''More of the bigger stuff is transacting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That opinion jibes with the business trend at Mortgage Master of Walpole, Mass., which merged with <span class="companylink">loanDepot</span> in January to become one of the country's largest nonbank lenders, funding $2.1 billion in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What our mortgage applications reflect is that we see a lot more activity at the higher end in general,'' said Paul Anastos, the president of Mortgage Master. He noted that jumbo loans (which exceed conventional conforming loan limits) account for about 25 percent of the combined companies' business. The brisker activity among jumbo borrowers -- those who take out loans greater than $417,000 -- is partly because, while there has lately been some loosening of credit for borrowers at the lower end, ''for the most part, the easing of guidelines has been a bit more on the jumbo end,'' Mr. Anastos said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers on the lower end -- looking for homes priced at $250,000 and below -- ''are generally of moderate credit and are having trouble or being intimidated from applying for mortgages,'' said Lawrence Yun, the chief economist and senior vice president for research at the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. ''While on the upper end,'' he continued, ''given the stock market bull run of the past six years, they have done very well financially. The stock market expansion has given a comfort level at the top tier of families to go ahead and apply.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor limiting sales at the lower end is a limited number of houses to choose from, as this is where ''inventory shrinkage has been most acute,'' Mr. Yun said. Investors paying cash have exacerbated that trend by quickly buying up bargain properties. And those lower-priced cash transactions are not included in mortgage application data, which Mr. Yun theorized is another explanation for the current disparity between loan size and home price. He predicted that the number of cash transactions would come down this spring, ''which means mortgage values should reflect home prices more closely.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at the same time, he noted, home builders ''are not building to the level they need to,'' and are instead concentrating principally on the upper end of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are seeing a major price boost on the newly constructed home,'' he said. ''And there will be an ongoing shortage of inventory on the lower end.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks advanced Friday, capping a strong week, helped by a recovery in the price of oil[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/energy-environment/oil-petroleum-and-gasoline/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and earnings from Olive Garden owner <span class="companylink">Darden Restaurants</span> and sportswear giant <span class="companylink">Nike</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> inched closer to the nominal high it reached at the height of the dot-com bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once again, it was the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> affecting much of this week’s market movement. <span class="companylink">The Fed</span> implied at the end of its two-day meeting Wednesday that its policymakers were in no hurry to raise interest rates with the U.S. economy still growing slowly and inflation extremely low. Friday’s rally was partly an extension of that, strategists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The trepidation in the market before the Fed announcement has disappeared,” said Kristina Hooper, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average rose 168.69 points, or 0.9 percent, to 18,127.72; and the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span> 500-stock index rose 18.65 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,107.92.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> added 34.04 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,026.42, 22 points from the high of 5,048 it hit in March 2000. It has taken the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> 15 years to recover nominally from the dot-com bubble, while the S.&amp;P. 500 and <span class="companylink">Dow</span> recovered their losses in 2007 and 2006, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Dow</span> member <span class="companylink">Nike</span> was among the biggest gainers Friday, rising $3.66, or 3.7 percent, to $101.98. <span class="companylink">Nike</span>’s results beat expectations, but investors focused more on the fact that foreign sales remain strong despite the rising dollar and overseas market volatility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rapid rise in the dollar has been a particular sore spot for investors. The dollar is up more than 8 percent against the major currencies, which makes goods made in the U.S. more expensive abroad and has had a direct negative impact on sales. The dollar rose to 120.09 yen from 120.76 yen Thursday. The euro rose to $1.0809 from $1.0668 the previous day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest example was jewelry maker <span class="companylink">Tiffany &amp; Company</span>, which cut its full-year profit forecast, saying the higher dollar was making its products less attractive to foreign buyers. Tiffany’s stock fell $3.44, or 4 percent, to $82.93.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The dollar’s appreciation has been rapid and it’s become a problem for many of these companies who have significant exposure to foreign markets,” said Russ Koesterich, BlackRock’s global chief investment strategist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> rose 92 cents, or 6.6 percent, to $15, after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter financial results on a boost in home sales and higher prices as the housing market continues its recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil also helped the market Friday. After dropping more than 3 percent Thursday, U.S. benchmark oil for April delivery jumped $1.76, or 4 percent, to $45.72 a barrel. Energy stocks rose far more than the rest of the market. The <span class="companylink">S&amp;P 500</span>’s energy sector gained 2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil ended a volatile week up 2 percent even after dropping to its lowest level in six years on Tuesday. Oil inventories are at record highs, but the number of rigs drilling for oil is falling fast and a sliding U.S. dollar is making oil a more attractive investment to overseas buyers. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 89 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $55.32 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other futures trading on the <span class="companylink">NYMEX</span>, wholesale gasoline rose 2.4 cents to close at $1.798 a gallon; heating oil[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/h/heating_oil/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] rose 1.2 cents to close at $1.734 a gallon; and natural gas fell 2.7 cents to close at $2.786 per 1,000 cubic feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the metals markets, precious and industrial metals futures rose. Gold gained $15.60 to $1,184.60 an ounce, silver jumped 77 cents to $16.88 an ounce and copper rose 10 cents to $2.76 a pound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.93 percent from 1.97 percent late Thursday.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Construction of homes plummeted in February, as fierce winter weather slowed housing starts in the Northeast and Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that builders began construction at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 897,000 homes in February, a steep 17 percent plunge from January. Housing starts slid 56.5 percent in the Northeast and 37 percent in the Midwest; they fell 18.2 percent in the West, and 2.5 percent in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brutal cold spell across the Northeast and Midwest most likely caused construction activity to slow last month. Fewer would-be buyers are touring open houses, and consumers seem intent on using their savings at the gasoline pump to pay down debt instead of on expensive items like housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact of the cold weather on construction is likely to subdue overall economic growth in the first three months of 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A weak first quarter is now a virtual guarantee as yet another cold winter is dampening activity,'' said Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at the brokerage BTIG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The builder sentiment index from the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo, which was released Monday, slipped to 53 in March, the third straight monthly decline. Readings above 50 indicate more builders view sales conditions as good, although the index showed a drop in buyer traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The historically low mortgage rates and strong hiring in recent months should eventually drive an increase home-buying. But sales have been muted after a relatively weak 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes in the United States were basically flat in January, falling 0.2 percent from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 481,000, according to a separate Commerce Department report. Sales climbed 5.3 percent from a year earlier, when extremely harsh winter weather hurt sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing industry analysts expect sales to rebound with the start of the spring buying season and as the broader economic strength ripples through to the housing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Approved building permits rose 3 percent to an annual rate of 1.09 million in February, with apartments accounting for the entire gain and offsetting a decrease in permits for single-family houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates are still near lows. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 3.86 percent last week, according to the mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. A year ago, it was 4.37 percent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some of the top business stories to pay attention to in the coming week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing Starts, In Winter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the Commerce Department will report data on new home construction in February. Most analysts are looking for a slight decline in new starts, to an annual rate of about 1.04 million, largely because of very cold weather last month. Although new construction of both single- and multifamily units has gradually strengthened over the last several years, the current level of activity is half what it was during the boom years of 2005 and 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home construction in particular has been weak, with a much healthier recovery in multifamily properties. Some economists think that with unemployment down, and hints that wages might be rising more quickly, demand for single-family homes might rebound more strongly in 2015. That might or might not happen, but don't expect much evidence either way in the data for February, given the deep freeze. --Nelson D. Schwartz</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thinning Patience</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>, which meets Tuesday and Wednesday, is likely to take another step toward raising interest rates. Analysts expect the Fed to signal that it could raise rates as soon as June by removing the word ''patient'' from the policy statement it releases after the meeting. <span class="companylink">The Fed</span>'s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, will hold a news conference after the statement is released. --Binyamin Appelbaum</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Electoral Tremors</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A provincial election in the Netherlands on Wednesday could have an impact on the European natural gas markets. Political groups in the Groningen area of the Netherlands are essentially running against the way the Groningen gas field, Europe's largest, is operated. The field is causing earthquakes, and growing pressure from the local population has already forced the central government to order the Shell-Exxon joint venture to trim production. But it could be forced to do more. --Stanley Reed</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scanning Tax Dodges</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">European Commission</span> will lay out plans Wednesday to shine a brighter light on sweetheart tax deals that some European governments have granted multinationals. The proposal -- a response to public indignation over the deals -- would aim to push <span class="companylink">European Union</span> member governments to exchange more information about the sort of tax arrangement Luxembourg offered to Amazon, and Ireland offered to Apple. Big member states like France and Germany broadly support the idea, and that should help it eventually win approval from governments. --James Kanter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deflating Property</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China on Wednesday will release monthly data on residential property price trends in 70 major cities that are expected to reflect the slump in the housing market, a key benchmark for the overall health of the economy. In January, prices had fallen in 64 of the 70 cities when compared with December. Data released last week showed new housing starts, measured by floor space, fell 20 percent in the first two months of the year compared with a year earlier, while new land purchases by developers fell 32 percent. --Neil Gough</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reliance on Russia?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">European Union</span> leaders meet in Brussels on Thursday for their spring summit meeting. The main focus is expected to be on whether the bloc should renew sanctions on Russia for its actions in Ukraine. Leaders will also hold a preliminary discussion about forging closer ties between their energy sectors, as concerns grow that some countries still rely too heavily on Russia for natural gas. The meeting is scheduled to continue Friday with discussions on the threat posed by instability in Libya. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece could face questions about plans to reform his country's economy. --James Kanter</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans had a dimmer view of inflation, spending and home prices last month, according to a <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> survey that appeared to log a change in perceptions on the economy. The <span class="companylink">New York Fed</span>'s survey of consumer expectations also found a marked jump in expectations of job stability in February, and of finding a new job if need be. With overall inflation measures below the central bank's target, median one-year-out inflation expectations fell for a third straight month to 2.8 percent, the lowest level since the survey started in mid-2013. Thanks to depressed views especially in the West, median home price change expectations dropped to 3 percent from 3.4 percent a month earlier, the lowest level since the survey began. The web-based survey queries about 1,200 Americans on a 12-month rotating basis.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A WEST INDIAN-STYLE OCEANFRONT VILLA IN ANGUILLA</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$3.4 MILLION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This colorful West Indian-style villa was designed and built by the owners in 2001 next to a well-known beach, Shoal Bay East, on the northern shore of the Caribbean island of Anguilla. The three-bedroom four-bath villa, along with a one-bedroom one-bath guest cottage, encompasses several concrete structures designed around five courtyards on a two-acre plot. The total square footage is 8,700, including the guest cottage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With sea views from almost every room, the villa has many expansive windows, doors and alcoves allowing breezes to sweep through. The main pool courtyard has a 26-by-16-foot infinity-edge pool and a sizable gazebo. The owners emphasized the villa's West Indian style with ornate gingerbread trim, louvered windows and traditional shutters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walls around the courtyards ensure that ''the house is completely private from the driveway and yet is completely open to the outdoors once inside,'' said Mary Ann Green, an owner of the villa. The main entrance opens to an airy living room with purple-painted cypress ceiling beams, yellow stuccoed walls and floors tiled in terra cotta and coral stone. Opposite the front door are expansive sliding-glass pocket doors opening to the pool courtyard. The home is being sold completely furnished, including linens and dishes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clustered around the pool courtyard is a building with a large bedroom and an indoor and outdoor bathroom; a gazebo with a living room; an arbored outside dining area; and a building with a kitchen, office and bedroom with bathroom, which is connected to another building housing the master suite and indoor-outdoor master bathroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main villa has four bathrooms, two of which open to walled courtyards with large bathtubs, showers and gardens. The kitchen is painted a light teal with a matching refrigerator, tiled backsplash and countertops of Corian. An oversize kitchen window opens toward the pool to create an outdoor bar for dining. The master suite, with sea-blue walls, soaring cypress ceilings painted white and teak floors, has steps down to a sitting area with built-in daybeds. The master has expansive doors opening to a private veranda and the sea, as well as a walk-in closet. The indoor bathroom has doors opening to the walled outdoor bathroom with an enormous marble-lined jetted tub.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Set back from the shore is a separate laundry building with a bathroom, adjacent to a one-car garage topped by solar panels for electricity. The nearby guest cottage has a bedroom, bathroom and living room with open kitchen. A walled-in garden has an outdoor shower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buildings are all hurricane- and earthquake-resistant high-density concrete block. The property has about 230 feet of rocky shoreline, and the home is elevated about 30 feet above sea level. Barrier and fringe reefs protect the villa from high water and offer snorkeling. Just steps away is the white sand beach, which has beach bars and other amenities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The villa is on the northern shore of Anguilla, an island of roughly 35 square miles with about 16,000 residents. Scott Hauser, a broker with <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>/Anguilla Properties, which has the listing, said top-notch restaurants were a 10- to 20-minute drive from the villa. The island's golf course is about 20 minutes away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, North Americans visiting Anguilla fly into the nearby island of St. Maarten and take a 20-minute boat ride or a 10-minute flight to Anguilla from there, Mr. Hauser said. The villa is about 15 minutes from the ferry terminal and 10 minutes from the airport, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARKET OVERVIEW</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market on Anguilla, a British overseas territory attractive to North Americans seeking vacation homes, was slammed by the global real estate crisis of 2008, with home prices falling as much as 40 to 50 percent, according to some real estate agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With an increase in sales last year, ''things are better but not back to where they were,'' said Jackie Pascher, an owner/broker of Island Dream Properties in Anguilla. ''I don't expect prices will start climbing until maybe the end of this year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anguilla's easygoing lifestyle, one of ''beautiful beaches, security, social harmony, excellent water quality and great dining,'' attracts many foreign home buyers, particularly those between the ages of 35 and 50, said Adrian Kobbe, a partner at Gum/ko International, a real estate agency in Anguilla and architect with Kobbe Design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anguilla does attract retirees, but because health facilities are not top-tier, older residents moving here tend to be in good physical condition, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are private elementary schools, so the island appeals to families with children under age 10, but options are limited for higher education, Mr. Kobbe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bulk of foreign home sales are taking place in the $750,000 to $1.5 million range, with less demand for multimillion-dollar homes than there was at the height of the market in 2007 and 2008, he said. Anguilla also tends to attract affluent foreigners seeking a third or fourth home, Mr. Hauser said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the low end of the market offers a sprinkling of $200,000 condominiums, the housing market also has mega-villas priced as high as $25 million, he said. ''I would say the bulk of the market, where you find a clustering of homes, would be in that $1.5 million to $2.5 million zone,'' he said. Ms. Pascher said that the market for homes in the $5 to $7 million range may be perking up, with many recent inquiries in that price range and one sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHO BUYS IN ANGUILLA</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vast majority of foreign home buyers in Anguilla are from the United States, particularly the Northeast, Mr. Hauser said. A much smaller number of buyers comes from Europe, particularly the United Kingdom, and from Canada, agents said. There have also been a few Russian buyers, Ms. Pascher said. She also noted that 2014 saw fewer American buyers than normal because of the weak United States dollar -- a trend that ended this year once the dollar gained strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUYING BASICS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are restrictions on foreigners buying real estate in Anguilla. They must be granted an Alien Landholders License by the government, a fairly straightforward process involving an application, a bank reference and other documentation. Far from being a formality, the process is taken seriously by the government, though most applicants are granted a license, Mr. Kobbe said. The application fee is $400.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreigners seeking to buy undeveloped land are typically restricted to parcels no bigger than half an acre, though there is some room for negotiation in the case of those seeking to construct larger buildings, Ms. Pascher said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most home buyers use a lawyer, which typically costs about 1 to 1.5 percent of the home's sales price, she said. Anguilla has a hefty stamp duty of 12.5 percent for foreigners on top of a 5 percent transfer tax, a large chunk of money that agents said is offset in part by minimal property taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most foreigners do not finance their home purchases, as interest rates can be as high as 8.5 or 9 percent, agents said. Though the East Caribbean dollar is Anguilla's official currency, many transactions, including those in real estate, use United States dollars. The listing for this house is in United States currency.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">February proved to be a strong month for stocks in the United States, even though it ended in downbeat fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major stock indexes closed lower on Friday, capping a week of subdued trading that nonetheless delivered a couple of new highs for the <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average and <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index. It also brought the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> within striking distance of its March 2000 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> notched the biggest monthly gain at 7.1 percent. But the S.&amp;P. 500's 5.5 percent increase was its best monthly performance since October 2011, and a turnaround from its 3.1 percent slide in January. The <span class="companylink">Dow</span> rose 5.6 percent for the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trading was listless for much of Friday as investors balanced encouraging reports on housing and consumer confidence against data showing that the United States economy grew at a slower annual rate in the final months of 2014 than previously estimated. Oil rose, recouping some of its losses from a day earlier. Technology stocks were among the biggest decliners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Many people are trying to figure out what to do, taking some profits when they can,'' said JJ Kinahan, <span class="companylink">TD Ameritrade</span>'s chief strategist. ''It's a wait-and-see attitude.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow</span> ended down 81.72 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,132.70. The S.&amp;P. 500 slid 6.24 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,104.50. The index is down 0.5 percent from a high of 2,115.48 on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> fell 24.36 points, or 0.5 percent, to 4,963.53. The index has been inching closer to the 5,000-point mark, something it has not done since March 2000 at the height of the dot-com boom. It is now within 86 points of that era's peak, though nowhere near a record when inflation is taken into account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three main stock indexes in the United States are all up for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bull market, now in its sixth year, has been powered by strong corporate earnings growth and low interest rates, which make stocks more attractive relative to bonds. Strong job growth and improving consumer confidence have also encouraged traders, despite signs of sluggishness in Europe and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of that confidence appeared shaken on Friday, when the Commerce Department reported that the United States economy grew at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the October-December quarter, weaker than the 2.6 percent estimate last month. But other bellwethers were more upbeat: An index of pending home sales, an indicator of potentially completed sales, rose in January, and the <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span>'s index of consumer sentiment slipped this month but remains at the highest level in eight years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The market does not have a clear catalyst to either cause it to sell off or to surge forward, and we're getting a little expensive from a valuation perspective,'' said David Heidel, regional investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors should get a better sense of the economy and consumers' willingness to spend next week when automakers report their February sales figures and the government issues its monthly update on hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, eight of the 10 sectors in the S.&amp;P. 500 ended lower, with technology stocks notching the biggest decline. The sector is up 4.2 percent this year. Consumer staples rose the most. Those stocks are up 2.9 percent this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy companies were among the biggest decliners in the S.&amp;P. 500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Southwestern Energy</span> fell $1.27, or 4.8 percent, to $25.08, while <span class="companylink">NRG Energy</span> lost 79 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $23.98. <span class="companylink">Chesapeake Energy</span> slid 52 cents, or 3 percent, to $16.68.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Benchmark United States crude rose $1.59, to $49.76 a barrel, on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>. Brent crude rose $2.53, to $62.58 a barrel, in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil prices in the United States appeared to stabilize in February around the $50-a-barrel mark. That has made a crucial variable of business more predictable for investors, Mr. Kinahan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's really the kind of thing that gives stability to the stock market,'' Mr. Kinahan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United States government bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 1.99 percent from 2.03 percent late Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In metals trading, gold edged up $3 to $1,213.10 an ounce, silver fell 7 cents to $16.51 an ounce, and copper was flat at $2.72 a pound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other energy futures trading, wholesale gasoline rose 6 cents to $1.768 a gallon, heating oil jumped 16.3 cents to $2.30 a gallon, and natural gas rose 3.7 cents to $2.734 per 1,000 cubic feet.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Friday that its seasonally adjusted pending home sales index increased 1.7 percent to 104.2 last month. December's figure was also revised higher to show a decline of only 1.5 percent, compared with a previously estimated drop of 3.7 percent. The index is now 8.4 percent above its level one year ago and is at the highest level since August 2013. The data points to a rebound in the sales of existing homes in the coming months, particularly as the spring buying season gets underway. Measures of sales and construction fell last month, raising concerns that the housing market would continue to struggle after a weak 2014. But economists expect that strong job gains, low mortgage rates and solid consumer confidence will provide a moderate increase to home sales this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"> ''Through the volatility, the trend in home sales is probably up modestly at least,'' Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, said in a note to clients.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lisa Gray spent a few months searching for a home that would span the generations, one where her two sons would want to bring friends throughout their teenage years and that her aging parents could navigate with ease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She settled on a two-story house here tailored to include a game room for the boys and a first-floor guest bedroom to avoid the need for climbing stairs. The cost of most homes in this new development? Roughly $1 million — and up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘I thought I would just build and make it exactly like I want,’’ said Ms. Gray, a managing partner at a venture capital firm, who moved into her gray-speckled-stone home three months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacious new homes that <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>, one of the nation’s top builders, are constructing on 463 acres 30 miles west of downtown Philadelphia may represent just one small slice of new-home construction, but they also tell a larger story of an economy that is increasingly driven by the needs and desires of the nation’s most affluent consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘There are big barriers to homeownership for lower-income households,’’ said Jed Kolko, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, an online real estate company. ‘‘More homes have been selling in the million-dollar-plus range as the economy has recovered, and high debts and poor credit history are particularly strong challenges for many lower-income households.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the initial years after the collapse of the housing bubble, a severely wounded industry focused mostly on putting up more affordable duplexes and other multifamily housing, including rental apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some economists say that demand for multifamily construction is leveling off. Home price appreciation in general is slowing as well; the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span>/Case-Shiller index report on Tuesday showed a pace of growth in the single digits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this environment, builders are turning to the wealthy as the most reliable market on which to place their bets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘That buyer is financially very sound, and they are putting a significant amount down,’’ said Douglas C. Yearley Jr., the chief executive of Toll Brothers. ‘‘So, yes, we like the profile of that client and we are very confident they will close.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not just builders in the affluent northeast and along the California coast who are building million-dollar homes. Developers near Minneapolis, Houston and elsewhere are rapidly selling newly constructed million-dollar homes as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales of $1 million and higher account for only a small share of the overall market. Sales of new homes over $750,000 made up 3.7 percent of all new-home sales in 2013, according to census data. But for <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> and several other builders, the million-dollar price point has become a new sweet spot for attracting buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> sold 585 homes across the nation priced at $1 million or more, according to Metrostudy, a research company that focuses on residential real estate development and new-home construction. That was nearly three times the number it sold just two years previously, the company reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> has long included the high end in its spectrum of new homes, but even builders known primarily for affordable offerings, like <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span>, are selling a lot more million-dollar homes. According to Metrostudy, <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> in 2012 sold five homes for $1 million or more; last year it sold 145. <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span>/Del Webb/Centex, Taylor Morrison and <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> followed similar patterns in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For wealthy buyers, the recession is long gone, said Mike Castleman Jr., senior vice president of Metrostudy. ‘‘If the builders want to stay in business and keep the flywheel running, they go after that market.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even apart from the million-dollar level, many builders are moving upscale as fast as they can. The price of newly constructed homes has risen significantly faster than the price of existing homes, according to an analysis from Zillow, the online real estate firm. In September 2005, the average price gap between existing and new homes was about $32,000; by December 2014 it had widened to $122,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Newtown Square development, called Liseter, even the harsh winter weather was doing little to slow the bulldozers breaking through the frosty ground this month for homes that will feature cathedral ceilings, hand-scraped hardwood floors, winding staircases, his-and-her walk-in closets and garages with what look like antique barn doors. The development sits on a former Monticello-inspired estate where Jean Liseter Austin du Pont once bred Welsh ponies and hunting beagles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers can tweak the floor plan, pick from a variety of shower designs and fireplace tiles, and adjust the number of data ports in the walls. Since construction began in January 2013, <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> has sold 136 homes at Liseter and hopes to sell about 300 more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all the Liseter homes begin at $1 million, but buyers want extras — sunrooms, built-in wine storage, even the ultimate man cave with a glass-encased room for brewing beer — that push the price as much as $300,000 higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘We’re trying to cater to the higher end just because that’s what the market is demanding,’’ Brian Thierrin, a Toll Brothers senior vice president who is overseeing the Liseter project, explained as he meandered through model homes after showing off a club house that looked like a fancy restaurant and spacious gym in a separate building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In expensive cities like New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, million- dollar homes and apartments are hardly a rarity. But now they are spreading more widely across the country, and builders are eager to please the growing number of baby boomers who have risen to high salary levels and managed to accumulate substantial savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside a model home at Liseter, a soon-to-be-retired couple hovered over the blueprints of their new $1 million home, fussing over plans for their five-car garage to house a small Corvette collection. Their friends expected them to downgrade when they retired. Instead, by picking a new four-bedroom home, roomy enough to host grandchildren, they were doing the opposite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In suburban Minneapolis, buyers of million-dollar homes include executives from corporations that have headquarters nearby. While few large new developments are in the works, several custom builders are putting up designer homes in Edina, Minnetonka and other upscale suburbs. Last year, 468 homes, new and previously owned, sold for $1 million or more in the Twin Cities metro area, just over the number sold in 2004, around the time of the previous peak, according to Chris Prescott, a real estate agent with Redfin, a national brokerage firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘One million dollars buys a heck of a lot more in Minnesota than it does on the coast,’’ said Mr. Prescott, who has worked in the area for 25 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same goes for areas outside Houston such as Sugar Land and Woodlands, where $1 million buys a 3,500-square-foot home with a swimming pool on a half-acre lot, according to Tara Waggoner, a Redfin agent there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow, said that the housing market would not return to full health until builders are able to attract customers of all income levels. And with the job market finally improving, developers say more affordable homes may be on the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Clearly, new construction has skewed to the high end during the recovery,’’ Mr. Humphries said. ‘‘To get back to normal, they’re going to have to eliminate that bias and serve a larger, more representative set of home buyers.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As published in the International New York Times</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Feb. 26 about home builders’ targeting of affluent buyers misstated the inspiration for the former estate upon which the luxury-home builder Toll Brothers is building its Liseter development in Newtown Square, Pa.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- New single-family home sales in the United States fell only slightly in January despite big declines in the snow-battered Northeast, while supply rose to its highest level since 2010, hopeful signs for a sluggish housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported on Wednesday that sales dipped 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 481,000 units. December's sales pace was revised up to 482,000 units, the highest level since June 2008, from 481,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are still taking sort of a meandering, bumpy path toward recovery,'' said Stephanie Karol, a United States economist at <span class="companylink">IHS</span> Global Insight in Lexington, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We expect housing will improve later this year due to the improvement in the labor market and credit conditions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were probably held back by snowstorms in the Northeast, where sales recorded their biggest drop since June 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had forecast new home sales, which account for about 9.1 percent of the housing market, falling to a 470,000-unit pace last month. Compared with January of 2014, sales were up 5.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing index rose marginally, outperforming a broadly flat stock market. Shares in <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span>, the No. 2 home improvement chain in the United States, fell slightly despite reporting same-store sales well above analysts' estimates. Increased spending on home renovations also helped Lowes' larger rival <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> post better-than-expected sales and profit on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing activity has remained lackluster since hitting a speed bump in the second half of 2013, as tight home inventories and higher prices have sidelined first-time buyers, and tepid wage growth also has constrained sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing industry has lagged the overall economy, even though mortgage rates have declined substantially from their 2013 peak. Recent data showed a plunge in home resales in January and softer single-family housing starts and permits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen, told lawmakers on Tuesday that housing had not ''recovered in the way that I would have anticipated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Mortgage Bankers Association said its measure of loan requests for home purchases, a leading indicator of home sales, increased 4.6 percent last week, rising for the first time in six weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is more reason to be optimistic on housing. The labor market is gaining steam, and housing activity should be lifted as more people get a paycheck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, home prices are showing signs of accelerating after slowing for much of 2014. That should help more homeowners out of so-called underwater mortgages, giving them more equity in their properties and allowing some to put their houses on the market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDNEWTOWN SQUARE, Pa. -- Lisa Gray spent a few months searching for a home that would span the generations, one where her two sons would want to bring friends throughout their teenage years and that her aging parents could navigate with ease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She settled on a two-story house here tailored to include a game room for the boys and a first-floor guest bedroom to avoid the need for climbing stairs. The cost of most homes in this new development? Roughly $1 million -- and up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I thought I would just build and make it exactly like I want,'' said Ms. Gray, a managing partner at a venture capital firm, who moved into her gray-speckled-stone home three months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacious new homes that <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>, one of the nation's top builders, is constructing on 463 acres 30 miles west of downtown Philadelphia may represent just one small slice of new-home construction, but they also tell a larger story of an economy that is increasingly driven by the needs and desires of the nation's most affluent consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are big barriers to homeownership for lower-income households,'' said Jed Kolko, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, an online real estate company. ''More homes have been selling in the million-dollar-plus range as the economy has recovered, and high debts and poor credit history are particularly strong challenges for many lower-income households.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the initial years after the collapse of the housing bubble, a severely wounded industry focused mostly on putting up more affordable duplexes and other multifamily housing, including rental apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some economists say that demand for multifamily construction is leveling off. Home price appreciation in general is slowing as well; the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index report on Tuesday showed a pace of growth in the single digits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this environment, builders are turning to the wealthy as the most reliable market on which to place their bets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That buyer is financially very sound, and they are putting a significant amount down,'' said Douglas C. Yearley Jr., the chief executive of Toll Brothers. ''So, yes, we like the profile of that client and we are very confident they will close.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not just builders in the affluent northeast and along the California coast who are building million-dollar homes. Developers near Minneapolis, Houston and elsewhere are rapidly selling newly constructed million-dollar homes as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales of $1 million and higher account for only a small share of the overall market. Sales of new homes over $750,000 made up just 3.7 percent of all new-home sales in 2013, according to census data. But for <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> and several other builders, the million-dollar price point has become a new sweet spot for attracting buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> sold 585 homes across the nation priced at $1 million or more, according to Metrostudy, a research company that focuses on residential real estate development and new-home construction. That was nearly three times the number it sold just two years previously, the company reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> has long included the high end in its spectrum of new homes, but even builders known primarily for affordable offerings, like <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span>, are selling a lot more million-dollar homes. According to Metrostudy, <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> in 2012 sold just five homes for $1 million or more; last year it sold 145. <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span>/Del Webb/Centex, Taylor Morrison and <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> followed similar patterns in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For wealthy buyers, the recession is long gone, said Mike Castleman Jr., senior vice president of Metrostudy. ''If the builders want to stay in business and keep the flywheel running, they go after that market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even apart from the million-dollar level, many builders are moving upscale as fast as they can. The price of newly constructed homes has risen significantly faster than the price of existing homes, according to an analysis from Zillow, the online real estate firm. In September 2005, the average price gap between existing and new homes was about $32,000; by December 2014 it had widened to $122,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Newtown Square development, called Liseter, even the harsh winter weather was doing little to slow the bulldozers breaking through the frosty ground this month for homes that will feature cathedral ceilings, hand-scraped hardwood floors, winding staircases, his-and-her walk-in closets and garages with what look like antique barn doors. The development sits on a former Montpelier-inspired estate where Jean Liseter Austin du Pont once bred Welsh ponies and hunting beagles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers can tweak the floor plan, pick from a variety of shower designs and fireplace tiles, and adjust the number of data ports in the walls. Since construction began in January 2013, <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> has sold 136 homes at Liseter and hopes to sell about 300 more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all the Liseter homes begin at $1 million, but buyers want extras -- sunrooms, built-in wine storage, even the ultimate man cave with a glass-encased room for brewing beer -- that push the price as much as $300,000 higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're trying to cater to the higher end just because that's what the market is demanding,'' Brian Thierrin, a Toll Brothers senior vice president who is overseeing the Liseter project, explained as he meandered through model homes after showing off a club house that looked like a fancy restaurant and spacious gym in a separate building. Final work on an infinity pool awaited warmer temperatures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In expensive cities like New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, million-dollar homes and apartments are hardly a rarity. But now they are spreading more widely across the country, and builders are eager to please the growing number of baby boomers who have risen to high salary levels and managed to accumulate substantial savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside a model home at Liseter, a soon-to-be-retired couple hovered over the blueprints of their new $1 million home, fussing over plans for their five-car garage to house a small Corvette collection. Their friends expected them to downgrade when they retired. Instead, by picking a new four-bedroom home, roomy enough to host grandchildren, they were doing the opposite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In suburban Minneapolis, buyers of million-dollar homes include executives from corporations that have headquarters nearby. While few large new developments are in the works, several custom builders are putting up designer homes in Edina, Minnetonka and other upscale suburbs. Last year 468 homes, new and previously owned, sold for $1 million or more in the Twin Cities metro area, just over the number sold in 2004, around the time of the previous peak, according to Chris Prescott, a real estate agent with Redfin, a national brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One million dollars buys a heck of a lot more in Minnesota than it does on the coast,'' said Mr. Prescott, who has worked in the area for 25 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same goes for areas outside Houston such as Sugar Land and Woodlands, where $1 million buys a 3,500-square-foot home with a swimming pool on a half-acre lot, according to Tara Waggoner, a Redfin agent there. Many of the buyers are in the oil industry, relocating from the coasts or overseas, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers say the rise of million-dollar home building reflects in part the challenges of gambling on open space in an uncertain market. As the recession eased, many builders bought only the most desirable sites, paying top dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> recently acquired 5,000 lots in California where most of the homes will sell for more than $1 million. The new million-dollar homes Taylor Morrison is offering in Irvine, Calif., sold more quickly than the company expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not purposefully skewing our business toward million-dollar homes,'' said Erin Willis, a spokeswoman for Taylor Morrison. ''We're not going after these buyers because they have money. Core locations even in a bad market will perform better than bad locations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span>'s bigger number of homes priced above $1 million last year -- mostly in California and Northern Virginia -- is a small part of the inventory for a company that has an average selling price of roughly $330,000, said James Zeumer, a company spokesman. ''The increase does not reflect a strategic shift in our business, but rather the normal mix and price shifts that can occur for a national builder,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow, said that the housing market would not return to full health until builders are able to attract customers of all income levels. And with the job market finally improving, developers say more affordable homes may be on the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Clearly, new construction has skewed to the high end during the recovery,'' Mr. Humphries said. ''To get back to normal, they're going to have to eliminate that bias and serve a larger, more representative set of home buyers.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home prices rose in December at a faster pace than the previous month, probably because of a much smaller number of homes for sale. Other economic reports released Tuesday showed that activity in the services sector was expanding, while consumer confidence was ebbing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index, released on Tuesday, increased 4.5 percent in December compared with 12 months earlier. That is up from 4.3 percent in November and the same as October's annual increase. The small gain comes after price increases slowed for 12 consecutive months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans are listing fewer homes for sale, pushing up prices and keeping many houses out of reach for would-be buyers. Still, the smaller price gains are more sustainable and less harmful for potential buyers than last year's double-digit increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes for sale in December was equal to just 4.4 months of sales, the lowest level in nearly two years. Six months of supply is typical for a healthy housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The housing recovery is faltering,'' said David M. Blitzer, chairman of the S.&amp;P. index committee. ''While prices and sales of existing homes are close to normal, construction and new home sales remain weak.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller index covers roughly half of American homes. The index measures prices compared with those in January 2000 and creates a three-month moving average. The December figures are the latest available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All 20 cities reported price gains compared with the year earlier. The biggest gains were in San Francisco, where prices rose 9.3 percent, and Miami, where they jumped 8.4 percent. Chicago reported the smallest gain, at 1.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes fell last year after two years of steady recovery. That has led many economists to forecast a rebound in sales in 2015, but so far there are few signs of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, existing home sales tumbled 4.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.82 million, the slowest pace in nine months, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday. And the construction of new homes fell 2 percent in January, the Commerce Department said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower mortgage rates and strong job growth may yet spur more sales this year. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 3.76 percent last week, according to the mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That has risen in recent weeks, but is far below the 4.33 percent average from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employers have ramped up hiring, encouraged by strong growth last spring and summer. The United States economy added more than a million jobs from November through January, the fastest three-month pace in 17 years. More Americans earning paychecks should eventually push home sales higher. In a separate report on Tuesday, the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> reported that its consumer confidence index dropped this month to 96.4 from a revised 103.8 in January. The February and January readings are the highest since before the recession officially started in December 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the index, consumers are modestly less confident about current economic conditions, considerably less confident about the next six months, and they are slightly more likely to say jobs are ''hard to get'' than they were in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, the consumer confidence index was 78.3. The rising confidence over the past year reflects in part the stronger job market. Consumers' spirits have also risen as gasoline prices have plummeted -- to $2.31 a gallon from $3.42 a year ago. Still, gas prices are up from $2.04 a gallon a month ago, according to AAA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence measures ''remain at inspiring levels,'' Bricklin Dwyer, an economist at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>, wrote in a research report on Tuesday. ''We continue to expect consumer spending to kick the year off on a robust foot after the drop in energy prices gave consumers a substantial windfall.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United States economic growth slowed to a solid, but unspectacular, 2.6 percent annual pace in the last three months of 2014. Economists say the economy is likely to grow about 2.5 percent from January through March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other data, the United States services sector expanded in February at its fastest pace since October, with businesses reporting more orders because of improving economic conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financial data firm Markit said its preliminary reading of its Purchasing Managers Index for the service sector rose to 57.0 in February from 54.2 in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While parts of the East Coast have struggled in the face of adverse weather, other regions basked in unusually warm temperatures, boosting business above seasonal norms,'' said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, in a statement. ''Activity levels surged higher and inflows of new business boomed as a result.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slump in crude oil prices and disappointing home sales data nudged stocks mostly lower on Monday, pulling the market back from last week's closing highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average and <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index spent much of the day hovering slightly below their recent highs. But the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> mounted a late-afternoon comeback that extended its win streak to nine days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil drilling companies and homebuilders notched broad declines, while traders bid up shares in utilities stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors were looking ahead to the start of a two-day round of congressional testimony by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen. The remarks could provide insight into when the central bank will begin raising its key interest rate from near zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The markets are in a holding pattern,'' said Erik Davidson, chief investment officer of <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> Private Bank. ''We'll have some very interesting information coming up from Janet Yellen tomorrow and Wednesday, so the markets are looking at that very closely.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow</span> ended down 23.60 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,116.84; and the S.&amp;P. 500 fell 0.64 point, or 0.03 percent, to 2,109.66.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> gained 5.01 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,960.97. The index is now within 87 points of its dot-com-era closing high, not adjusting for inflation, from March 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three stock indexes are up for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks started the day flat as investors weighed developments in Greece and falling oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greece's new government and its creditors reached an agreement over the weekend that staved off any immediate threat of a Greek bankruptcy and an exit from the euro. Athens was expected to send its creditors a list of reforms tied to the four-month bailout pact early Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of oil fell for the fourth day in a row as the return of a Libyan oil field raised expectations for more oil supply. Benchmark American crude fell $1.36 to settle at $49.45 a barrel in New York. That helped drag down shares in several offshore oil drilling and oil field services companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transocean shares fell 75 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $16.26, while stock in Ensco shed $1.11, or 3.7 percent, to $28.65. <span class="companylink">Nabors Industries</span> shares fell the most percentage-wise among stocks in the S.&amp;P. 500, losing 5 percent, or 67 cents, to $12.85.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors bought up shares in <span class="companylink">Valeant Pharmaceuticals</span>, which on Sunday announced a deal to buy a rival drugmaker, <span class="companylink">Salix Pharmaceuticals</span>, for about $10 billion in cash. Valeant stock rose $25.49, or 15 percent, to $198.75.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A midmorning report showing that sales of previously occupied homes tumbled 4.9 percent last month sent most homebuilder shares lower. UCP shares declined sharply, shedding 45 cents, or 4.8 percent, to $8.97.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The home numbers were a little disappointing,'' said Robert C. Doll, chief equity strategist at <span class="companylink">Nuveen Asset Management</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, six of the 10 sectors in the S.&amp;P. 500 fell. Telecommunications stocks declined most, while utilities stocks led the gainers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday will provide investors with some fresh insight on the state of the economy. The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> reports its latest consumer confidence index. The January reading surged to the highest level since August 2007, and economists anticipate a retreat for the February reading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the biggest market-moving news could come from the Fed. Ms. Yellen is scheduled to deliver her semiannual report to Congress on the economy and interest rates. Investors will be listening for any hints of when the central bank will move to raise its key interest rate. A higher rate would affect those on many consumer and business loans and could depress stock and bond prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Fed</span>'s most recent policy statement expressed the intention to be ''patient'' on raising rates. Many economists have predicted the central bank will raise rates in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other futures trading Monday, Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many American refineries, fell $1.32 to settle at $58.90 in London.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New research sponsored by the Department of Energy shows that buyers are willing to pay more for homes with rooftop solar panels -- a finding that may strengthen the case for factoring the value of sustainable features into home appraisals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study, conducted by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, examined sales data for almost 23,000 homes in eight states from 2002 to 2013. About 4,000 of the homes had solar photovoltaic systems, all of them owned (as opposed to being financed through a lease with the solar company).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers found that buyers were willing to pay a premium of $15,000 for a home with the average-size solar photovoltaic system (3.6 kilowatts, or 3,600 watts), compared with a similar home without one. Put another way, that translates to about four additional dollars per watt of solar power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study involved more solar property sales than previous research, making this sample particularly ''robust,'' said Sandra Adomatis, an appraiser in Punta Gorda, Fla., who is considered an expert in ''green'' valuation and is one of the study's authors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This study is important for the buying public and the lending side,'' Ms. Adomatis said, ''and appraisers can say, here's some proof there is some value to the system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More homeowners have been installing these systems as the cost of solar technology has dropped over the last decade. As of mid-2014, more than a half-million homes had solar systems, according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents, appraisers and lenders are still trying to catch up with the technology, along with other energy-saving features, in terms of calculating their effect on home values -- or lack thereof -- in any given market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> has acknowledged the growing proliferation of solar. In December, the government-sponsored institution issued a guideline specifying that if a house has an owned solar system, the appraiser should analyze the system and the market to see if it adds value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The guideline provides ''critical verbiage to give us some leverage'' with lenders, said Gerard O'Connor, an appraiser in Lindenhurst, on Long Island, who has been trained in green valuation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long Island's high electric costs have made it an attractive market for solar. About 40 percent of all systems installed in New York are on Long Island, according to the state's Energy Research and Development Authority. Buyers are ''certainly willing to pay more'' for a house with the electric bills to prove the savings attached to its solar system, Mr. O'Connor said. But, he added, most lenders haven't yet recognized that market shift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arthur Wilson, a builder developing five homes (all presold) with geothermal and solar panels in Middle Island on Long Island, has had his own issues with lenders. He said that an appraisal of $498,000 for the second house to be completed was recently ''shot down'' as too high by bank reviewers who he said were untrained in valuing green home features.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lender asked Mr. O'Connor to look at the appraisal, and he said that he believed it was accurate in estimating the value of energy-saving features.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Any new item or feature is always a nightmare in appraising,'' Mr. O'Connor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He noted that, under the new <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> guideline, appraisers may not add value for leased solar systems, which are increasingly popular because they usually require no money upfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Berkeley lab report notes that more research is needed into the effect of leased systems on home value.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 2008, when Diana Vaynshenker and Avner Rubinstein were married, she joined him in his condominium at Schaefer Landing in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He had bought the one-bedroom preconstruction in 2005 when the market was at its peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They loved the waterfront view and their water-taxi commute to Downtown Brooklyn, where Ms. Vaynshenker, 33, works as a lawyer and Dr. Rubinstein, 42, is a dentist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple remained in their 850-square-foot apartment through the housing bubble, watching as housing prices dipped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When their daughter Ariel was born in 2012, it was time to move to larger quarters. By then, housing prices had rebounded. ''Though we did not plan our family according to the real estate market, it happened that way,'' Ms. Vaynshenker said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They sold the condo at $582,000 for a modest profit and declined the chance to buy a neighbor's two-bedroom, knowing they would eventually outgrow that, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides, their hearts were set on a house. They preferred earning the income from a rental unit to paying the common charges of a condo. Their budget allowed them up to $900,000. The suburbs were not an option, because Ms. Vaynshenker, who grew up in Sheepshead Bay, doesn't drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the hunt, the family moved to an apartment building in Windsor Terrace, cramming into a rental of 500 square feet. The couple found they loved the neighborhood, half a block from Prospect Park, where their daughter played with her friends at the LeFrak recreation center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They found that houses listed by the big brokerage firms were out of reach, often priced at $1 million or more. Open houses were packed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I very quickly realized that for us to stand a chance, I would have to look for houses that were minimally or, better yet, not advertised at all,'' Ms. Vaynshenker said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One day, she saw a for-sale sign on a house in Windsor Terrace. It was in contract, but the agent said that next door, a two-family frame rowhouse was about to go on the market. The price was $659,000 to reflect the work it would need.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three months later, after the owner left, the couple were finally able to enter. ''Nothing prepared us for what we saw,'' Ms. Vaynshenker said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nothing was really salvageable except maybe the top floor,'' said Dr. Rubinstein, who is from Rockland County and who had prior experience renovating houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, the couple was prepared to pay the asking price, figuring it was one of their few chances to have a house in Windsor Terrace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at the last minute, a stronger bidder appeared with an offer of the full asking price and a 50 percent down payment, more than double what the couple were prepared to put down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Vaynshenker found an ad for a two-family a block away, a handsome brick rowhouse with a barrel front listed for $910,000. ''It was the kind of house where you could do more work, but you didn't have to,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They bid $850,000, but another buyer snapped it up for $900,000. Now, Ms. Vaynshenker said, she realizes the place was ''an amazing value'' at either price: ''The house right next door sold for $1.4 million.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They heard about a house just over the border in Kensington, a three-family listed for $959,000. This one also had a beautiful barrel front. It was comparatively pricey but appeared to be in good shape. Again, actually getting in to see the interior was a challenge. Three months passed with little explanation for the delay. They kept looking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By now, Ms. Vaynshenker was expecting a second baby. She felt she had exhausted the Internet's offerings. So, one rainy day, she set out on foot, looking for for-sale signs and asking residents if they knew of any available houses. ''That's the point that I reached,'' she said. ''I was asking random people on the street.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in Kensington, someone pointed the way toward Sunset Park and Green-Wood Cemetery. Sure enough, a two-family house had a sign out front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agent was unable to schedule a showing of the occupied ground-floor rental unit, but the top floor was in decent shape, except for the birds nesting in the oven. The price was $950,000. The couple's offer of $850,000 was accepted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they were able to see the lower unit, they found it was not in good shape. ''My husband wasn't sure he wanted it anymore,'' Ms. Vaynshenker said. ''But at that point, I felt like we needed to pull the trigger because our options and opportunities were limited.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They bought the house late last spring and started renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The floors were rotted; the pipes were cracked. ''It was much more work than we ever imagined,'' said Dr. Rubinstein, who worked mornings and evenings for months, acting as the general contractor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family moved in late last summer, occupying the top-floor unit, with three bedrooms, two living areas and one bathroom. They rented out the ground-floor unit, a slightly smaller three-bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are farther from Prospect Park than they were before. The walk is a full 18 minutes. But Ariel still makes the trip and sees her playmates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is very hard to get a house in Brooklyn,'' Ms. Vaynshenker said. ''But ultimately we got very lucky with our house, because it really does work for us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly after their arrival, Maya was born.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Whereas Ariel, when she was 2, had already moved twice,'' Ms. Vaynshenker said, ''this baby is going to stay put for a long time.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Producer prices in the United States in January recorded the biggest decline in more than five years on plunging energy costs, pointing to benign inflation in the near term, which could argue against raising interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other reports on Wednesday suggested that the economy was growing moderately early in the first quarter. Housing starts fell last month, while manufacturing output edged higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The reports paint a disappointing picture on the U.S. recovery, with the housing starts report in particular reinforcing the narrative that the housing recovery might be in a spot of bother,'' said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said its Producer Price Index for final demand fell 0.8 percent, the biggest drop since the revamped series started in November 2009, after dipping 0.2 percent in December. It was the third straight month of decline in the index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 12 months through January, producer prices were unchanged, the weakest year-on-year reading since records started in November 2010, after rising 1.1 percent in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had forecast the index's declining only 0.4 percent last month and gaining 0.3 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower energy prices, against the backdrop of softer global demand and increased shale production in the United States, as well as a strengthening dollar, are reducing domestic inflation pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The weak P.P.I. report adds further evidence of building disinflationary pressures in the U.S., not only in headline prices, but also in core prices,'' Mr. Mulraine said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>, which has a 2 percent inflation target, views the tame price environment as transitory, signs that the energy-driven weakness is leaking to core inflation could cause discomfort among some policy makers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An important measure of underlying producer price pressures, which excludes food, energy and trade services, fell a record 0.3 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most economists expect the central bank to start raising interest rates in June, citing rapidly tightening labor market conditions. <span class="companylink">The Fed</span> has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American economy still faces difficulties created by a stronger dollar and weaker overseas markets, which weigh on exporters. Manufacturing output rose a modest 0.2 percent in January and was flat in December, the Fed said in a separate report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wholesale energy prices tumbled a record 10.3 percent in January after sliding 6.2 percent in December. It was the seventh straight month of declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Food prices fell 1.1 percent, the largest decline since April 2013, after falling 0.1 percent the previous month. The volatile trade services component, which mostly reflects profit margins, rose 0.5 percent after a similar gain in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said housing starts fell 2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.07 million units in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the decline, which was driven by a fall in groundbreaking for single-family projects, housing starts remained above the million-unit mark for a fifth straight month. Compared with January last year, groundbreaking was up 18.7 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sluggish wage growth and a shortage of homes on the market stymied housing last year, even as the broader economy was accelerating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a turnaround in housing is expected this year as a rapidly tightening labor market pushes up wages and encourages more young adults to move from parents' homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, permits for future home construction dipped 0.7 percent to an annual pace of 1.05 million units. Permits have been above a million-unit pace since July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family permits fell 3.1 percent last month, while multifamily permits rebounded 3.6 percent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most investors, a diversified portfolio means a prudent mix of stocks and bonds. For the global elite, diversification increasingly means splurging on New York apartments that can cost tens of millions of dollars, or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across Manhattan, real estate developers are scrambling to meet surging demand from buyers around the world who are prepared to pay record-setting prices for new developments with opulent finishes and extraordinary views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These buyers -- some of whom obscure their identities through webs of shell companies-- are not all rushing to call the Big Apple home. Instead, many of them are paying record prices with the expectation that their investments will appreciate, even as they sit empty for most of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the buying frenzy reached new extremes, with one apartment changing hands for more than $100 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've become a global piggy bank,'' said Kirk Henckels, vice chairman of <span class="companylink">Stribling &amp; Associates</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet at the upper echelons of the property market, the lines between prudent investing and splashy one-upmanship are inherently blurred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you're talking about a bank account that big, diversification is a basic rule of economics and investment,'' Mr. Henckels said. ''It's a wonderful way to justify investing in your toys.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Head-scratching prices aside, New York real estate has proved to be a durable, even lucrative long-term investment. Residential property in Manhattan appreciated 26 percent over the last five years, according to data from <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not bad. But compared to stocks, which have rebounded sharply since the financial crisis, it is subpar. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index is up more than 75 percent over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among certain New York properties, though, the appreciation was more striking. New development, which accounts for many of the priciest sales in the city, is up 52 percent over the last five years, Corcoran says. And at the highest end of the market, returns outperformed almost all other asset classes. In 2013, properties that changed hands for more than $9.5 million gave their sellers an average 32 percent profit, according to StreetEasy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you study the values of New York real estate, whether it's five or 10 or 20 years, the story says buy,'' said Pamela Liebman, chief executive of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A major factor feeding the sudden buying binge is a flood of new properties that cater to the top tier of global buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Half a dozen residential skyscrapers are sprouting in Midtown Manhattan, each promising views, amenities and materials fit for kings and queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One57, the first completed, has sold most of its units, including the city's first $100 million apartment. Further east, the gridlike facade of 432 Park Avenue already looms over Midtown, its perfectly square windows making it the city's newest architectural statement. Both buildings offer full-floor palaces high in the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Years ago we didn't have these kinds of properties,'' Ms. Liebman said. ''But savvy developers realized that if you build it, they will come.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even more new residential skyscrapers will soon cast long shadows over the city. The skinniest of the bunch will be erected above the Steinway piano building on West 57th Street, in what has become known as Billionaires' Row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearby, a tower next to <span class="companylink">the Museum of Modern Art</span>, designed by the French architect Jean Nouvel, is on the road to construction. So is 220 Central Park South, a limestone spire designed by Robert A. M. Stern. Around the city, other projects will compete for attention and dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not that the city lacked inventory. It has the most expensive real estate market in the country, with thousands of multimillion-dollar apartments, townhouses and mansions changing hands regularly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as tastes changed, apartments that once appeared palatial now seem pedestrian. Today's new construction includes floor-to-ceiling windows, full-floor residences, opulent finishes and amenities like room service from Michelin-starred chefs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For the superwealthy who are used to five- or six-star hotel services around the world, it's a really great way to not just travel now, but to live,'' Ms. Liebman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Putting a price on such trophy properties is no science. ''Art is a closer analogy than stocks or bonds,'' said Christopher J. Mayer, a real estate professor at <span class="companylink">Columbia University</span>. ''What matters is the amount of this stuff available and the number of people looking at it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And to explain why buyers will pay such soaring prices, brokers often resort to metaphors, not mathematics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How else do you explain $10,000 a square foot?'' said Mr. Henckels at <span class="companylink">Stribling &amp; Associates</span>. ''It's the same thing with the price for carats of a pink diamond or square inches of a Warhol.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least one buyer appears to believe that his new residence is an actual work of art. William A. Ackman, the hedge fund manager who bought a penthouse at One57 as an investment that he plans to keep empty save for the occasional event, called his $90 million party pad ''the Mona Lisa of apartments.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the Mona Lisa is one of the most reproduced artworks in the world. And as more such towers rise around Manhattan, the views and floor plans for which Mr. Ackman and others are paying top dollar may not be unique.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's more space on Park Avenue than there are billionaires who want to live in New York,'' Mr. Mayer said. ''Unlike Picassos, there is not a finite number of these properties.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Ms. Liebman, whose company represents sponsors of several new buildings, acknowledges that the market is becoming crowded. ''There will be winners and losers,'' Ms. Liebman said. ''Some buildings are better than others. Savvy buyers will play the buildings against each other.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, however, demand is not ebbing. Foreign buyers continue to view New York real estate as a safe place to park money, keeping inventory tight and demand high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have the greatest influx of foreign buyers that we've ever seen,'' Ms. Liebman said. ''The Chinese have made a huge impact on New York real estate along with Latin, European, Russian buyers. The past year has brought us a lot of Middle Eastern buyers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For these buyers -- oligarchs, international corporate chieftains and foreign royalty -- who make up an estimated 30 to 50 percent of high-end buyers, there are various allures to Manhattan property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a repository of money, it's in the dollar currency, and it's in New York City,'' said Gary Barnett, president of Extell Development Company, whose projects include One57.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currency fluctuations, unpredictable world affairs and unstable governments contribute to the desire for a safe haven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It can be a good idea to have money outside your home markets,'' Mr. Henckels said. "Hardly any of these people are actually New York City residents.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet a market reliant on a small cadre of the world's richest men and women can also be fragile. ''A 50 percent drop in the price of oil is a huge risk,'' said Mr. Mayer of Columbia. ''A significant number of the world's billionaires rely on oil.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Believers in the ever-rising tide of property values point to a notable resale at One57. Last May, a Chicago-based investor bought a three-bedroom apartment for $30.6 million. In October, the unit was sold to a hedge fund manager for $34 million. That quick profit -- an appreciation of 11 percent in less than half a year -- made it one of the better investments of 2014. ''The perception is that if you're getting in on Day 1, you're almost guaranteed to see price increases,'' Ms. Liebman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the higher the price, the more elusive the potential returns. If an apartment sold for $100 million today were to enjoy the same appreciation as the first resale at One57, it would trade hands for $111 million later this year. ''I'm skeptical from here about how much appreciation there can be,'' Mr. Mayer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And with so many other trophy properties coming to market, it is unclear if Mr. Ackman or others like him will be able to find a buyer soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am concerned,'' Mr. Henckels said. ''The biggest question is, have we overbuilt luxury inventory, and I don't know the answer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, this is not the first time that speculators have bet on Manhattan property or that critics have grumbled about a bubble. In the years before the financial crisis, two marquee properties hit the market and broke records. New construction at 15 Central Park West attracted prominent buyers looking for pristine new construction. And condominium conversions at the Plaza Hotel overlooking Central Park proved alluring to moneyed buyers looking for a piece of old New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, critics thought buyers were overpaying and prices would never go higher. But over the last eight years, prices in those buildings have continued to rise. ''Look at the profits people have made there,'' Mr. Henckels said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a certain point, however, logic fails to explain what are ultimately emotional decisions, and real estate experts again turn to the art world for explanations. ''These guys will buy a $50 million to $100 million painting and put it on their wall,'' Mr. Barnett said. ''Or you can buy a $50- to $100-million piece of real estate that is probably more unique, and no one can steal it from you. Some people actually think that way.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A walk through Corona shows ample evidence of a recent finding that it is home to the most heavily Latin American immigrant community in Queens. Colombian bakeries, Mexican taquerias and Dominican lunch counters dot commercial areas. Spanish conversations fill the streets. And sporting goods stores are more likely to display Ecuadorean national soccer jerseys than fan gear from the Jets and Giants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corona covers a 1.26-square-mile area in north-central Queens, amid some of the borough's other large immigrant communities such as Jackson Heights (Latin American and South Asian) and Flushing (Chinese and Korean) -- all of them stops on the ''International Express,'' as the No. 7 subway line is sometimes called.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corona was deemed to have the most heavily Latin American immigrant community of any Queens neighborhood by a 2013 <span class="companylink">New York City Department of City Planning</span> report, ''The Newest New Yorkers,'' which also stated that 64.2 percent of Corona's 103,210 residents were foreign born.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was Corona's rich cultural character that drew Julissa Gutierrez, 33, back to the neighborhood in 2006 after she attended college in Delaware and graduate school in Chicago. She grew up there in a three-family house owned by her parents, who were immigrants from Colombia, and now lives in one of the units with her sister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Coming back here was very natural to me,'' said Ms. Gutierrez. ''I enjoy the diversity. It is a trademark of who I am.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gutierrez also likes Corona's proximity to La Guardia and Kennedy airports because she travels often for her job with a nonprofit organization. She can easily get to the Queens Center mall in Elmhurst and to Forest Hills for shopping, and subway service is good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has noticed the neighborhood is more crowded. What was once an empty lot across from her family home now holds a 10-unit apartment building, she said, making parking more difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras, who lived in Corona until moving to East Elmhurst a year and a half ago, said overdevelopment is one of the neighborhood's biggest challenges. In recent years, many two-family homes have been torn down and replaced with larger, multifamily buildings. The resulting influx of residents has not only affected parking, but has also brought in more traffic and strained city services, Councilwoman Ferreras said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's hard seeing these beautiful, large colonial homes disappearing,'' she said. ''As a resident, it makes me sad, because I like the feel of old Corona.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another transformation the councilwoman has witnessed is Corona's evolution from a predominantly Italian neighborhood to a Latin American community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I grew up, we were one of two Latino families on the block,'' she said. ''Now, it is all Latino.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corona Plaza, at 103rd Street and Roosevelt Avenue, has become a meeting place since it was turned into a pedestrian zone in 2012. Councilwoman Ferreras said the plaza has taken on the role of the central squares found in towns and cities in Latin America. ''If you go to many of these countries, everyone comes to a centrally located plaza at some point in the day.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What You'll Find</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corona is bounded by Northern Boulevard to the north, Junction Boulevard to the west, the Long Island Expressway to the south and Flushing Meadows-Corona Park to the east. Residential side streets are lined with tightly spaced houses, many of them two- or three-family homes built in the 1920s. Interspersed among the older homes are newer buildings, containing apartments for three to 10 families. As one moves south toward the Long Island Expressway, larger apartment buildings are more prevalent. On the southern border is the massive LeFrak City rental complex, built in the 1960s, which has 20 high-rise buildings, shops, playgrounds and a swimming pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What You'll Pay</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A search of the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, which includes Queens, in late January showed 73 single- and multifamily homes for sale in Corona and 49 condominiums and co-ops. Demand for housing in Corona is high and prices are going up, real estate professionals say. Jose Jimenez, a broker/owner of Exit Realty Success in Corona, said ''the market has improved tremendously'' since the 2008 economic downturn. He said prices were about 10 to 15 percent higher than they were five to six years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jorge Santiago, an agent with the Century Homes Realty Group in Flushing, said he has noticed an increased interest in Corona as nearby areas like Jackson Heights, Woodside and Elmhurst have become more expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-end properties include buildings with three or more units, generally listed in the range of $1 million to $1.5 million. In the midrange are older two-family homes, typically priced from the lower $700,000s to the upper $800,000s, depending on condition and proximity to the subway. As for condos and co-ops, studios and one-bedrooms can be found for $100,000 or less; new, larger units start in the mid-$300,000s. A recent search for rentals on StreetEasy.com showed 24 available apartments in Corona, including a large studio for $1,250 a month, a one-bedroom for $1,300 a month and a three-bedroom in LeFrak City for $2,395 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What to Do</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, with 897 acres, runs along the neighborhood's eastern border. Home to two World's Fairs, in 1939 and 1964, it has ball fields and courts and a lake and serves as the venue of the United States Open each year. The park also houses the Queens Zoo, the New York Hall of Science and the Queens Museum, perhaps best known for its Panorama of the City of New York, a miniaturized version of the city. Citi Field, the <span class="companylink">New York Mets</span>' stadium, is within walking distance of the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area has a vibrant dining scene with shops selling freshly baked empanadas, Argentine steakhouses and some of the city's highest regarded Mexican taquerias. The Lemon Ice King of Corona on 108th Street attracts big crowds in warm weather with its fruity frozen treats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Schools</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Councilwoman Ferreras said five new schools were scheduled to open in Corona in the coming years to alleviate overcrowding. Among the larger elementary schools in the neighborhood is Public School 16, the Nancy DeBenedittis School, serving about 1,700 students from kindergarten through Grade 5. According to the <span class="companylink">New York City Department of Education</span> 2013-2014 Elementary School Quality Snapshot, 26 percent of the students there met state standards for English, compared with the citywide average of 30 percent. In math, the students matched the citywide average of 39 percent. P.S. 19 Marino Jeantet School has about 2,000 students, with 22 percent of its students meeting state standards in English, 35 percent in math. There are two other large public elementary schools, P.S. 14 Fairview School with about 1,750 students and P.S. 143 Louis Armstrong School with about 1,800 students. According to the Department of Education, 24 percent of students at P.S. 14 met state standards in English and 35 percent in math, while at P.S. 143, 13 percent met state standards in English and 22 percent in math.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commute</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The No. 7 subway line stops along Roosevelt Avenue at Junction Boulevard, 103rd Street-Corona Plaza and 111th Street. A ride from Corona Plaza to Times Square takes about 35 minutes. The neighborhood also has easy access to the Grand Central Parkway and the Long Island Expressway, making travel convenient to airports and points east.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The History</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jazz great Louis Armstrong lived with his wife, the former Lucille Wilson, in a modest brick home on 107th Street from 1943 until his death in 1971. The house, a city and national landmark, is now a museum (guided tours only) that houses an archive of his recordings, letters, manuscripts and photos.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — A gauge of U.S. business investment plans fell for a fourth straight month in December. It was a potential sign that slowing global growth and falling oil prices were weighing on the economy, but other data on Tuesday suggested any damage would be limited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence vaulted to a near seven-and-a-half-year high in January, and new home sales in December hit their highest level since June 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Referring to the gauge of investment plans, Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York, said the drop in capital spending would probably limit growth, “though stronger consumer spending should keep G.D.P. from slowing too much.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft — a closely watched proxy for business spending plans — dropped 0.6 percent last month after a similar decline in November. Orders for these so-called core capital goods started to decreasing in September; there hasn’t been a four successive months of declines since 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists, who had expected a 0.5 percent gain, said the surprise drop last month probably reflected weak overseas demand for a wide range of capital goods and declining demand at home for energy-related equipment. They also cited a strengthening dollar as a factor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dour report came as construction and mining equipment maker <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> reported a nearly 25 percent decline in fourth-quarter profit and warned that falling oil prices would hurt its business in 2015. A number of U.S. producers already have curtailed drilling activity and announced job cuts amid an oil glut that has slashed crude prices by about 60 percent since June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dollar strength is also undermining corporate profits. <span class="companylink">Procter &amp; Gamble</span>, the world’s largest household products maker, said full-year sales would most likely fall 3 percent to 4 percent because of the stronger dollar. Chemicals company <span class="companylink">DuPont</span> also forecast lower operating earnings for 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, on Monday, said the dollar was a factor behind a decline in its quarterly earnings as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak equipment spending is likely to catch the attention of <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> officials, who have been eyeing midyear for a possible interest rate hike. Fed officials started a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The dollar’s strength is starting to show up in terms of weaker orders, a new soft spot for manufacturing that perhaps will give some of the policy makers pause if not worry,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at <span class="companylink">MUFG Union Bank</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government’s gross domestic product measurement, fell 0.2 percent last month after slipping 0.6 percent in November and 0.9 percent in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said that suggested a downside risk to their fourth-quarter GDP estimates, most of which currently hover around a 3 percent annual pace. The government will publish its first snapshot of fourth-quarter growth on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With core capital good orders falling, overall orders for durable goods - items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more - tumbled 3.4 percent in December. It was the fifth straight monthly decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the economy appears to be in reasonable health. Services sector activity picked up in January for the first time since June, financial data firm Markit said separately; and the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said consumer sentiment jumped this month to its highest level since August 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report from the Commerce Department showed new home sales rose in December to their highest level since 2008. The increase came as mortgage rates trended lower, fueling a jump in home loan applications this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“January’s impressive surge in mortgage applications suggests we may see continued momentum in new home sales,” said Derek Lindsey, an analyst at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report, however, showed a deceleration in house price gains. The S&amp;P/Case Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas rose 4.3 percent in November from the prior year, the slowest since October 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing lagged growth in the overall economy last year, but it is expected to get a boost from a strengthening jobs market. Slowing house price gains together with moves by the government to ease credit conditions also are seen helping.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When James Michael Howard, a decorator[http://www.jamesmichaelhoward.com/Home.aspx] from Jacksonville, Fla., began designing and building homes in the Hamptons[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/longisland/hamptons/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] five years ago, he decided “they would have more cachet if they were furnished.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last fall, Mr. Howard’s third turnkey property, a 10,500-square-foot, seven-bedroom shingle-style house in Water Mill, N.Y., sold for slightly more than the $11,950,000 asking price. The interiors were filled with eye-catching chandeliers, sumptuous sofas and chairs, paintings, sculptures and a billiards table; the bedrooms were outfitted down to the fine linens, fur throws and down coverlets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next month, Mr. Howard will finish decorating a new seven-bedroom residence in Water Mill with antiques he bought in France[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/great-homes-and-destinations/destinations/europe/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] and Britain, “cool accessories” and what he described as about $1.5 million worth of custom rugs from Nepal, Turkey and China. Two sets of bedding, pots and pans, stemware, towels and “the best pillows” complete the house, which is listed for $24,950,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s done,” Mr. Howard said. “It’s not staged like a spec house.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is part of a trend of selling fully furnished luxury homes and condominiums in New York, Los Angeles[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/great-homes-and-destinations/destinations/southern-california/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] and Miami[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/great-homes-and-destinations/destinations/south-florida/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], as well as abroad, designed to look as if people with high net worth and good taste have lived there for a long time. The buyers of these turnkey homes can move in with little more than their clothes and a toothbrush.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People love it because it’s so easy,” Mr. Howard said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary DePersia[http://www.corcoran.com/hamptons/Agents/Display/3434], an associate broker with <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> — who was the listing broker on all three of Mr. Howard’s done-to-the-nines mansions — has four listings for furnished spec homes (including Mr. Howard’s latest) and six resales over $10 million that are available as turnkey properties. All are on the East End of Long Island[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/longisland/?inline=nyt-geo].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If buyers “walk into a house and they love the way the house looks,” Mr. DePersia said, “they are going to buy the furnishings because it makes it easier.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though buying a luxury home furnished can add anywhere from $250,000 to several million dollars to the price, the buyers may later “selectively replace some or most of the furniture” when they “have time for their interior decorator to make the changes,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The phenomenon is international and being fueled by super-wealthy buyers with multiple homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In New York, London and Hong Kong, there is a demand from high-net-worth buyers to have turnkey properties,” said Giles Hannah, a senior vice president at Christie’s International Real Estate. “These are new prime houses or luxury serviced apartments that are fully interior designed and furnished that are ready to move into.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In developments like 15 Central Park West[http://15centralparkw.com/] in New York, 1 Hyde Park London[http://www.onehydepark.com/#/index], the Westminster Terrace Hong Kong and the Bulgari residences in London, more than $2 billion worth of apartments have been sold furnished by developers over the past five years, according to Mr. Hannah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Developers are furnishing apartments to cater for the tastes and needs of wealthy families who desire premium furniture in their homes and convenience of being able to move straight in after purchase,” Mr. Hannah said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/manhattan/?inline=nyt-geo], the developer Edward J. Minskoff[http://www.ejmequities.com/] decided to kick off the sales of six new apartments and townhouse condos in an elegant turn-of-the-century eight-story building at 37 East 12th Street[http://37e12.com/] in Greenwich Village by listing a two-bedroom furnished model, including museum-quality antiques, for $9.35 million. “It is immediate gratification,” Mr. Minskoff said of the $500,000 décor. The buyers “don’t have to go through the pain of furnishing an entire apartment.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the West Coast, in Beverly Hills last month, Markus Persson, the Swedish creator of the Minecraft video game, paid $70 million in cash for a fully furnished contemporary eight-bedroom 15-bath spec home, including millions of dollars in furnishings. The 23,000-square-foot house has throws and chairs by Hermès and sofas by the Bentley Home Collection[http://www.bentleymotors.com/en/world-of-bentley/bentley-collection/licenced-partners/bentley-home-collection.html], a dining-room table that seats 24, Roberto Cavalli tableware that costs $3,700 a place setting, cases of Dom Pérignon and a Dylan’s Candy Bar wall brimming with sweets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sally Forster Jones[http://aaroe.com/sallyforsterjones], the president of Aaroe International Luxury Properties, who represented the buyer, said that the turnkey aspect was very important to the buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You walk in and you love exactly what you see, so you want the whole package,” Ms. Forster Jones said. The deal closed in six days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Angeles, “right now, most of the high-end properties are coming furnished,” she said. “That is the draw, particularly among international buyers and those purchasing second, third and fourth homes.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Miami, an influx of European, Russian and South American buyers has caused a huge run on furnished real estate, said Steven Gurowitz, the owner of Interiors by Steven G[http://www.interiorsbysteveng.com/about/steven-g-interiors/], who teams with developers to outfit condominiums for sale. Mr. Gurowitz furnished 62 new luxury units last year, and he expects to do 80 to 100 this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo buyers “do not want to wait,” or bother with the downtime incurred by hiring a designer and going to condo boards and municipalities for approvals, Mr. Gurowitz said. “The wealthy want instant gratification. They see it, and they say, ‘How much?’&nbsp;”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The uptick in buying turnkey homes also applies to resales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Barman, a New York interior designer, is asking $15.75 million for his newly renovated and expanded Sagaponack house, furnished eclectically with traditional English wing chairs, an antique Regency foyer console, Moroccan lantern chandeliers, English Raj furniture and vintage midcentury European and American pieces, and fully accessorized and equipped with white towels and sheets with coordinating colored trim to match the bedrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As a designer, I realize how difficult it often is for people to complete the decoration of a house,” Mr. Barman said. Besides time, “there is also the decision-making process, which can be difficult for people trying to imagine the outcome.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the premium for buying a turnkey property, “for a large house, seeing what you are getting and not paying for mistakes and saving the time and effort makes it worthwhile,” Mr. Barman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, Barbara Candee[http://www.danielgale.com/AgentDetail.aspx?segmentid=2670446&amp;bioid=barbaracandee&amp;htmlfile=property_find-an-agent.html], an associate broker with Daniel Gale Sotheby’s International Realty, sold an English Regency-style waterfront home in Mill Neck, N.Y., for $11.5 million, with furnishings that included a Steinway piano, upholstered couches, rugs, a French mirror and two paintings in the living room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese buyer, who had seen photographs of the house online, liked the professional décor, Ms. Candee said. The owner, who has other homes, wanted to keep only some paintings and personal possessions. The décor “became part of the negotiations” but was not subject to the sales commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the buyer, who does not speak English and was not familiar with the area, keeping the furnishings was easier than finding a decorator, Ms. Candee said. She added, “It is very expensive to furnish an entire house.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing homes rebounded in December, but continued low participation by first-time buyers suggested the housing recovery in the United States would remain gradual for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Friday that existing-home sales increased 2.4 percent to an annual rate of 5.04 million units last month. That was slightly below economists' expectations for a pace of 5.06 million units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The still-tight mortgage credit conditions and more challenging first-time home buyer affordability that were revealed by the failure of home sales to continue recovering last year remain serious concerns as we head into 2015,'' said Ted Wieseman, an economist at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers made up 29 percent of transactions in December as well as for the year as a whole, well below the level needed to lift growth in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of 2014, sales of existing homes fell 3.1 percent, the first annual drop in four years. The housing market has struggled to maintain momentum since stagnating in the second half of 2013 after an increase in mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At December's sales pace, it would take around four months to clear all available houses from the market, down from about five months in November and the quickest since January 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, a recent decline in mortgage rates, an easing of lending standards and the resurgent health of the American economy over the last few months have generated optimism that sales could strengthen this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the outlook for the economy remains upbeat. In a separate report, the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said its Leading Economic Index, a composite average of economic indicators, rose 0.5 percent last month after a 0.4 percent increase in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December's jump was driven by gains in most of the index's components, suggesting the short-term outlook is getting brighter and the economy is continuing to build momentum, the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third report showed that manufacturing continued to expand in early January, though at a slower pace than in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financial data firm Markit said its preliminary manufacturing purchasing managers index for the United States fell to 53.7 in January, matching the 2014 low last January when severe weather reduced economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reading above 50 signals expansion in economic activity. Factory employment increased for a 19th consecutive month, but new orders were the lowest in a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The slowdown is being led by a weakening inflow of new orders, but the good news is that demand remained strong enough to drive yet another month of robust job creation at factories,'' said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit in London.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Groundbreaking for single-family homes in the United State rose in December to the highest level in more than six and a half years. Permits also surged in a hopeful sign for the sluggish housing market recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that single-family housing starts, the largest part of the market, jumped 7.2 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 728,000 units, the highest level since March 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That offset a 0.8 percent fall in groundbreaking for the volatile multifamily homes segment, lifting overall housing starts 4.4 percent to a rate of 1.09 million units last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had forecast starts rising to a pace of 1.04 million units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing has lagged an acceleration in economic growth as tepid wage gains sideline first-time buyers from the market and force many young adults to stay at home with parents or share lodgings with relatives and friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher house prices and stringent lending practices by financial institutions also have been a constraint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak household formation, in particular, has hurt residential construction. The slow pace at which Americans are setting up homes has been attributed to the high debt loads among recent college graduates as well as the prevalence of low-paying jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Household formation is running at about 500,000 a year, far below the more than one million that would signal a robust housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with wage growth expected to pick up, the 30-year mortgage rate down more than 80 basis points from early 2014 and moves by the government to ease credit conditions, housing is expected to gain momentum this year and help soften the blow from slowing global economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of 2014, groundbreaking increased 8.8 percent to 1.01 million units, the highest since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family housing starts in 2014 were also the highest in seven years. In December, groundbreaking on single-family projects in the West hit a seven-year high, while starts in the Midwest were the highest since December 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Groundbreaking in the multifamily homes segment fell 0.8 percent to a 361,000-unit pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While overall permits for future home construction fell 1.9 percent to a pace of 1.03 million units, they were dragged down by an 11.8 percent plunge in the multifamily segment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family permits rose 4.5 percent, to their highest level since January 2008. Permits in the populous South hit their highest level since February 2008.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A late rise in technology stocks helped the stock market stagger to a tiny gain following a choppy day of trading Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A combination of tepid earnings results, falling oil prices and downbeat news kept the market lower for most of the day. Major indexes started higher in the first few minutes of trading but quickly faded, as slipping confidence among homebuilders and another drop in crude pulled housing and energy stocks down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index spent the afternoon slowly recovering, until a late surge in Apple, <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> and other technology titans helped nudge the index up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's just a lot driving trading today,'' Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives with the Schwab Center for Financial Research. ''I think we're going to see more volatility for a while, not just down but up, too.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.&amp;P. 500 index inched up 3.13 points, or 0.2 percent, to finish at 2,022.55. The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average gained 3.66 points, a sliver of a percent, to 17,515.23, and the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> rose 20.46 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,654.85. Of the 10 sectors in the S.&amp;P. 500, technology companies had the best day, with Apple and <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> climbing 3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Frederick said he believed that uncertainty was behind the recent turbulence. At the moment, there are just too many open questions about oil prices and the global economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He pointed to two upcoming events that could swing markets: a meeting of the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> on Thursday and elections in Greece on Sunday. Many in the markets are betting that the bank will unveil a new effort to revive that region's flagging economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. economic news Tuesday offered little encouragement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A weak signal from the housing market sent builders' stocks down. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo's builder sentiment index slipped a point from the prior month, an indication that they feel slightly less confident in their sales prospects heading into the spring. <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> dropped 81 cents, or 3 percent, to $22.95, while <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span> lost 77 cents, or 4 percent, to $20.80.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> cut its forecasts for global growth over the next two years, warning that persistent weakness in most major economies will outweigh any benefit from lower oil prices. It now predicts global growth at 3.5 percent this year and 3.7 percent in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's government said that its economy expanded 7.4 percent last year, its weakest pace in 24 years. The slower growth is partly a result of Beijing's efforts to wean the economy off its reliance on heavy industry and trade. But a range of problems, including a slumping property market and uneven exports, have hampered the shift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe's stock markets ended mixed. France's CAC 40 gained 1.2 percent, while Germany's DAX closed with a gain of 0.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Johnson &amp; Johnson</span>, the maker of Tylenol, Band-Aids and baby shampoo, turned in earnings early Tuesday that beat analysts' forecasts, yet it came up short for revenue, largely a result of a stronger dollar. Sales of medical devices and other products sank as transactions in foreign currencies translated into fewer dollars. The company's stock fell $2.75, or 3 percent, to $101.29.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Delta Air Lines</span> surged $3.33, or 7 percent, to $49.17, thanks to its stronger results. The recent slump in oil prices helped, as the airline spent much less on fuel at the end of last year compared with the same period of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other trading, prices climbed in the government bond market, tamping Treasury yields down. The yield on the 10-year Treasury dipped to 1.79 percent, a sharp drop from 1.84 percent late Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most precious and industrial metals made gains. Gold continued its recent rally, climbing $17.30 to settle at $1,294.20 an ounce. Silver rose two cents to $17.96 an ounce. Copper was the exception, slipping 2 cents to $2.59 a pound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports of China's slower economic growth helped push the price of oil lower Tuesday. Benchmark U.S. crude for February delivery fell $2.30 to close at $46.39 a barrel in New York on the last day of trading for the contract. Brent crude for March delivery, the international benchmark, fell 85 cents to close at $47.99 in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other trading on the NYMEX, wholesale gasoline slipped 4.6 cents to close at $1.313 a gallon; heating oil fell 7.5 cents to close at $1.591 a gallon; and natural gas lost 29.6 cents to close at $2.831 per 1,000 cubic feet.</p>

</div><div class="author">By MICHELLE HIGGINS   </div><div>861 words</div><div>6 January 2015</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>19</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a banner year for Manhattan real estate. In 2014, buoyed by sales of ultraluxury apartments in new developments, the real estate market rebounded to surpass its previous peak, reached in 2008, when the financial crisis hit, according to Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average sales price reached a new high of $1,718,530 last year, surpassing the record set in 2008, when the average sales price for the year was $1,591,823, according to Mr. Miller, the author of a report for Douglas Elliman Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big-ticket closings also helped the average price per square foot climb to a record $1,297 for the year, above the previous high of $1,251 per square foot in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median apartment price, which measures the middle of the market and is less affected by high-end sales, was $940,000 in 2014, just behind the record of $955,000 set in 2008, according to Miller Samuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year ended on a high note, with the market performing very well in the fourth quarter, according to reports to be released on Tuesday by the city's major brokerages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was an extremely strong year,'' said Sofia Song, the head of research at Urban Compass, which reported record dollar volume in the fourth quarter of 2014 with approximately $5.4 billion in closed deals. ''Properties were being snapped up faster and at higher closing prices than the 2008 market peak.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median time an apartment spent on the market in 2014 was 46 days, according to Urban Compass, down from 64 days during peak market activity in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strong local economy, surging stock market and steady foreign interest helped bolster demand for Manhattan apartments, as supply remained a challenge. After hitting bottom at the end of 2013, inventory has been on the rise, with 5,912 available listings in the fourth quarter of 2014, up 20 percent from 4,913 in the same period last year, according to <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>'s report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the report noted, the number is 52 percent below the peak in the first quarter of 2009, when there were 12,336 listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan's superluxury market flourished in 2014, ending the year with nearly triple the number of closings with prices at $10 million or more in the fourth quarter compared with the same quarter a year ago, according to Urban Compass. Extell's One57, a new tower on West 57th Street that overlooks Central Park, made up the top five sales for the quarter, ranging from $8,819,873, or $4,390 a square foot, for Unit 55B, to $56,079,298, or $8,987 a square foot, for Unit 82.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top sales of the year, however, were in venerable co-ops: Israel Englander, the chairman and chief executive of the hedge fund <span class="companylink">Millennium Management</span>, bought a $71.3 million corner duplex at 740 Park Avenue, originally listed for $48 million; and a $70 million penthouse at 960 Fifth Avenue was bought by the Egyptian billionaire Nassef Sawiris, the chief executive of Orascom Construction Industries, and his wife, Sherine S. Magar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When people see people spending money like that they feel good about investing in the city,'' said Dottie Herman, the chief executive of Douglas Elliman, which reported half of all apartments in the fourth quarter sold at or above list prices, the highest percentage in six years. ''Buyers were super confident and sellers were able to achieve these extraordinary prices,'' said Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. ''And there's really no sign of things slowing down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of contracts signed in the fourth quarter, 3,216, was the highest since the fourth quarter of 2006, when 3,246 were signed, according to <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. Co-ops accounted for 58 percent of signed contracts this quarter, the highest co-op market share since the third quarter of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While overall condominium inventory has been on the rise, the fresh supply has come mainly from new buildings with large and expensive residences. ''We are desperate for two bedrooms and anything below $1.5 million is sure to disappear quickly as that segment of the market continues to be the most in demand and at the same time the most inventory challenged,'' Ms. Liebman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least twice as many new condominium units are scheduled to hit the Manhattan market this year as in 2014, the most since 2007, leading some real estate watchers to predict a tempering of price growth and slower pace of sales. ''It is anticipated that the market will likely see a price adjustment,'' in the first quarter of 2015, Urban Compass stated in its report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But don't expect many bargains. The agency forecasts ''modest reductions in median closing prices,'' with Manhattan prices remaining steady or dropping slightly.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- More Americans sought unemployment benefits last week, but the number of applications continued to be low enough to suggest that solid growth will continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said on Wednesday that the number of applications for unemployment benefits rose 17,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 298,000. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, rose 250, to 290,750. That average has fallen 17.5 percent in the last 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The claims data still point to relatively upbeat conditions in the labor market,'' said Daniel Silver, an economist at <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>, noting that the weekly figures routinely rise and fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications are a proxy for layoffs. For almost four months, the number of applications for jobless benefits has been less than 300,000, a level that suggests that employers expect strong economic growth to continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growing signs of a strengthening economy appeared to help nudge a few would-be home buyers. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Wednesday that its seasonally adjusted index of pending home sales rose 0.8 percent in November to 104.8 from a revised 104 in October. The index remains slightly below its 2013 average, but it is 4.1 percent higher than in November 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors group estimates that 2014 sales will end up below 2013 levels. It forecasts that 4.94 million existing homes will be sold in 2014, down 3 percent from 5.09 million in 2013. Analysts say sales of about 5.5 million existing homes a year are common in a healthy real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hopes are higher for the new year. In 2015, the group expects sales of existing homes to rise to 5.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying could also be helped by average 30-year mortgage rates that are staying close to a 19-month low. Rates nationwide averaged 3.87 percent this week, according to the mortgage company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home prices in the United States rose in October at a slightly slower pace, as real estate sales have fallen and affordability has increasingly become a challenge for potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index increased 4.5 percent in October from 12 months previous. The figures reported on Tuesday show the 11th straight month of decelerating price gains and had the smallest gain since October 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Tuesday, a private survey showed that American consumers were feeling more confident about the economy. The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said its consumer confidence index climbed to 92.6 this month from a revised 91 in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2014 slowdown in homes' price growth comes after surging double-digit increases for much of 2013. Home values climbed as the market recovered after bottoming out in 2011 following the housing bust and the recession. But home prices have outpaced lackluster wage growth, leaving many potential buyers unable to afford homes and causing both sales and price growth to stall this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent decline in mortgage rates has yet to bring more buyers into the market. Simultaneously, there are fewer distressed properties and bargains coming onto the market, which attract investors as buyers. All of that has occurred despite an improving American economy that has generated 2.65 million new jobs so far this year, as the unemployment rate has dropped to 5.8 percent from 6.7 percent at the start of 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices barely budged over the last 12 months in Cleveland, up 0.9 percent; Chicago, up 1.9 percent; New York, up 2 percent; Phoenix, up 2.1 percent; and Washington, up 2.2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there are signs that broader improvements in the American economy may be causing prices to rise faster in some cities. Compared with September, eight cities reported stronger year-over-year price growth in October. They include San Francisco, up 9.1 percent; Denver, up 7.2 percent; and Tampa, up 6.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are seeing hints that prices could end 2014 on a strong note and accelerate into 2015,'' said David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span><span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> Indices. The Case-Shiller index, which covers roughly half of United States homes, measures prices compared with those in January 2000 and creates a three-month moving average. The October data is the latest available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stan Humphries, chief economist at the real estate data firm Zillow, noted that slower price growth should ultimately lift the economy. When prices rise at levels closer to wages, more people are usually able to buy a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A slower-moving housing market is inherently more stable, more balanced between buyers and sellers and more sustainable over the long term,'' Mr. Humphries said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying could be helped by average 30-year mortgage rates that are staying close to a 19-month low. Rates nationwide averaged 3.83 percent last week, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>

</div><div class="author">By CONOR DOUGHERTY   </div><div>846 words</div><div>29 December 2014</div><div>International New York Times</div><div>INHT</div><div>14</div><div>English</div><div>© 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The locals say they don’t like the tech folks pouring into town to work at places like <span class="companylink">Google</span>. They’re insular. They’re driving up housing prices. And the locals fear those newcomers are more like invaders than people trying to fit into their new community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For once, this is not about San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Boulder, Colo., <span class="companylink">Google</span> is running into problems that would be quite familiar to people in the Bay Area. Over the past month, as the City Council approved a plan to let <span class="companylink">Google</span> build a four-acre campus — with space for the company to quintuple its local work force to about 1,500 people — there has been a spirited debate about <span class="companylink">Google</span>’s potential effect on local housing prices and whether the company’s country-club-like campuses would pair with the Boulder’s desire to increase pedestrian traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s easy to see why <span class="companylink">Google</span> would want to be in Boulder. The city, about a half-hour drive from Denver, has an educated populace, a well-regarded university, and — with its mountain locale and a combination of open space and compact, walkable development — is considered a fantastic place to live. The company has said its employees at the Boulder office work on apps including <span class="companylink">Google</span> Earth and <span class="companylink">Google</span> Drive, and also include sales and marketing teams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But cities — in particular, places like Boulder that are already pretty successful — can have mixed feelings about good, well-paying jobs of the sort <span class="companylink">Google</span> brings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Prices are rising. We are becoming less and less affordable to lower and middle income. We’re also seeing local businesses that have been here for decades being priced out,’’ said Suzanne Jones, a City Council member.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘It puts a finer point on this issue of ‘where are we headed?’ Attracting big business is great on the one hand, but it will be part of that change on the other,’’ she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In meetings, in emails to City Council members like Ms. Jones and with letters to the local newspaper, The Daily Camera, residents of Boulder have expressed concerns about <span class="companylink">Google</span>’s potential to raise home prices higher than they are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One resident, Allison Davis, who recently moved home to Boulder after three years in <span class="companylink">Google</span>’s hometown, Mountain View, Calif., wrote a letter to The Daily Camera relaying her observations on what happened to the Bay Area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘As <span class="companylink">Google</span> expanded, they rapidly priced out those who had not been lucky enough to buy housing in Mountain View before 1990. A city can lose its feel easily in a decade, and I already see that happening in Boulder,’’ Ms. Davis wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another point of contention, raised by both the City Council and the city’s planning board, was that <span class="companylink">Google</span>’s famously lavish campuses — with cafeterias, exercise areas and lounge-like common spaces where employees can chill out behind closed doors — might create a dead zone for pedestrian and retail activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the proposal came before the planning board this year, a board member suggested that the company include first-floor retail shops to attract people who do not work at the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Google spokeswoman said the company discussed the idea, but ultimately decided against retail space for a number of reasons, including a concern that it would increase car traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traffic, of course, was another big concern. <span class="companylink">Google</span> has noted that when it comes to transit, the campus is an urban planner’s dream. It will be next to a major bus depot, which should encourage its workers to take public transit. Googlers who do not take the bus are likely to car-pool or ride bikes, given that the campus will have just 600 parking spots for more than twice that number of workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company also agreed to put a bike and pedestrian path through the middle of its campus, creating a public thoroughfare through the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, of course, there are other benefits of having a big company like <span class="companylink">Google</span> in town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, <span class="companylink">Google</span> is likely to increase its hiring of graduates from the <span class="companylink">University of Colorado, Boulder</span> — people who may not be able to stay in town if the local economy does not add jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google</span> writes a lot of checks to nonprofit organizations and encourages its workers to volunteer. And while its free-lunch policy will never win the favor of local sandwich shops, the company noted that most of the food in its cafeterias is purchased from local farms and merchants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Elizabeth Payton, a member of the planning board, pushed back against the idea that Boulder is lucky to have <span class="companylink">Google</span>. Maybe, she said, it is the other way around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘The citizens have worked really hard and they have paid a lot of extra taxes to create this fabulous place,’’ she said. ‘‘It may be luck, but maybe we created this place where <span class="companylink">Google</span> wants to be. Maybe it’s not just luck.’’</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behind the facade of many a New York City apartment building is the dissonant sound of residents complaining. The gripes that make their way to the inbox of my Ask Real Estate column offer a glimpse into how residents cope with the myriad irritations that come with living in cramped and costly homes. They include the co-op shareholder horrified by a neighbor's rats' nest; the parents whose building has barred them from using a stroller in the elevator; and the renter whose kitchen cabinets fell from the walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, some New Yorkers dislike their neighbors almost as much as they do their landlords. Co-op and condominium boards beware: You do not fare much better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The questions New Yorkers ask the column are dictated not only by their individual circumstances but also by the larger issues of the day, like rising housing costs, gentrification and shoddy construction. In the end, 2014 was a year of things going up -- home prices, rents and, above all, buildings, with 16,700 units approved for construction through October, according to the Real Estate Board of New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what forces will shape the questions asked next year? It depends on who (and where) you are. While buyers should brace for another year of high-stakes bidding wars, residents of the city's far-flung neighborhoods (I'm talking about you, Grand Concourse) should be ready for an onslaught of prospective residents seeking bargains -- bargains, that is, relative to the gilded ZIP codes that are out of the reach of most mortals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the New Yorkers who have turned their apartments into bed-and-breakfasts, the battle over illegal inns could reach a fever pitch. On top of it all, Mayor Bill de Blasio's 10-year affordable housing plan will take shape just as legislation in Albany threatens to strain the pocketbooks of renters. These are among the game-changers looming as we ring in the New Year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neighborhoods</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, the average sales price for an apartment in New York City topped $1 million, a milestone with far-reaching implications. As the city's population soars, prices and buildings are rising in neighborhoods that missed the last housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I started in this business, Brooklyn was the alternative. Now it is a choice,'' said Diane M. Ramirez, the chief executive of Halstead Property. ''I see Queens becoming that way. The Bronx is not that far down the line.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 6,527 new rentals scheduled to hit the market in Brooklyn next year, 1,442 are in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Bushwick and Clinton Hill, all considered off the beaten path not that long ago, according to data provided by Citi Habitats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For newcomers, these changes provide fresh housing options. But for residents, they can spell displacement. The same is true for shops such as De Robertis Pasticceria and Caffe in the East Village, which just closed after a 110-year run. And next year, the Union Square Cafe will likely conclude its 30 years in Union Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''New Yorkers have been waking up and realizing this long period of prosperity has wreaked a little bit of havoc on things that we think of as classic New York,'' said Simeon Bankoff, the executive director of the Historic Districts Council, noting that 2015 will mark the 50th anniversary of the New York City landmarks preservation law. ''Things we always thought were going to be there are just closing left and right.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next year, the mayor's affordable housing plan, which calls for building or preserving 200,000 units of affordable housing over the next decade, will begin to take shape. It hinges on a policy that requires developers to build affordable housing in exchange for being allowed to construct taller and denser buildings in neighborhoods rezoned by the city. Developers and housing advocates alike are waiting to see what it will look like once the administration adds muscle and flesh to the bones of the proposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our goal is to produce as many units as we can and, at the same time, make sure that we do it in a way that maintains and enhances the health of neighborhoods,'' said Carl Weisbrod, the director of the Department of City Planning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">East New York in Brooklyn will be the test case when the Department of City Planning presents initial recommendations early next year. After that, the rezoning process could begin for the neighborhood, among the city's poorest. A proposal for west Flushing in Queens is next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We need to do what the mayor wants everybody to do, and that is build more housing,'' said Steven Spinola, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York. However, ''if the numbers don't work, if the rent that is coming in is less than the cost of maintaining the building, then you are not going to do it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing advocates worry that if rezoning is not done carefully, communities could quickly gentrify. ''Look at what happened in Williamsburg,'' said Harvey Epstein, the director of the community development project at the Urban Justice Center, referring to price escalations. ''I don't know why it wouldn't happen in East New York or the Bronx or in Flushing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers and Sellers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All-cash buyers. Skittish lenders. Skyrocketing prices. Anemic listings. These realities haunt buyers, turning the house hunt into a demoralizing slog. Unfortunately, buyers will probably have to soldier through another year of a market that favors sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our population and employment is at an all-time high and growing. That puts significant pressure on rents and prices,'' said Mark Willis, the executive director of the New York University Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy. ''There is no reason now to think that these trends are likely to change.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not all bad news for buyers: Prices will still head north next year, but the pace will likely slow from a sprint to a saunter. ''Prices can't just keep going up, up, up on this steep climb,'' said Pamela Liebman, the chief executive officer of Corcoran. ''Buyers get a little fatigued.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers looking for new construction will have more options next year, as the number of new condos hitting the market in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Long Island City, Queens, is expected to more than double to 8,366 from 3,444 in 2014, according to data provided by Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a quick look at the changing skyline betrays a frustrating reality: Those shiny new towers have failed to deliver the type of housing most New Yorkers can afford. ''There is a disconnect between what we're building and what we need to build,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. ''2015 is going to be more of that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners in neighborhoods like the Grand Concourse in the Bronx or Elmhurst in Queens could enjoy new attention from buyers eager to find the next untapped market. ''When have you heard talk about Kingsbridge in the Bronx?'' asked Ms. Ramirez of Halstead. ''The people who are smart are getting out there and buying it up at wonderful prices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renters</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is a silver lining: Market-rate rents are so high that they probably will not climb much higher next year. ''The good news is rents aren't rising anymore,'' Mr. Miller said. ''The bad news is they are probably not going to fall.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New construction will provide luxury options for renters with deep pockets, mostly in the boroughs outside Manhattan. In Brooklyn, 6,527 new rental units are expected to hit the rental market next year, nearly twice the 3,802 units anticipated for Manhattan, according to Citi Habitats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One such development is 60 Water Street in Dumbo, a 290-unit rental with a 24-hour concierge and a roof deck offering Manhattan views. Leasing begins next month, with rent for a two-bedroom starting at a jaw-dropping $6,018 a month. ''People want that condo-like living, even though they're renting and not owning,'' said Jodi Ann Stasse, the managing director of new developments for Citi Habitats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, New Yorkers living in the city's nearly one million rent-stabilized apartments should brace for a fight in Albany in June, when the rent-stabilization law expires. Housing advocates hope to see a reversal of a rule that allows landlords to deregulate vacant units if the rent reaches $2,500 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past 20 years, at least 133,000 units in the city have gone market rate because of this rule, according to the Rent Guidelines Board. If the trend continues, rent stabilization could be further weakened, undermining Mayor de Blasio's efforts to preserve affordable housing, say supporters of the policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is our make or break moment for the tenant movement,'' said Ilana Maier, the program director for the Metropolitan Council on Housing. ''If we aren't able to drastically strengthen the rules now, none of this will matter in 10 years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with a Republican-controlled State Senate, opponents of rent stabilization doubt that 2015 will be a watershed year for the tenants' movement. Sherwin Belkin, a lawyer who represents landlords, said: ''Landlords view this as an opportunity to make some much-needed changes to rent regulation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One suggested change: require rent-stabilized tenants to verify their income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> Showdown</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York it is illegal for anyone to rent out a room in an apartment in a multifamily building for less than 30 days if a tenant is not present. Yet almost weekly, someone writes to Ask Real Estate seeking advice on how to skirt the rules. What if I swap apartments? What if nothing is in writing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reckoning could come next year as the state and city attempt a crackdown on renegade hoteliers while the online company <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> lobbies for a change to the law. ''You are going to see an increased push to regulate this,'' said Samuel J. Himmelstein, a lawyer who represents tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> go away might not be so easy. A recent Quinnipiac poll found that 56 percent of the responders thought New Yorkers should be allowed to rent rooms out to strangers. ''We don't want to turn into hotels, but at the same time people want to rent out their apartments sometimes,'' said Paul R. Gottsegen, the president of Halstead Management Company, which manages 250 residential properties in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condos and co-ops have been laying down the law, writing warning memos and fining wayward residents. For renters, breaking the rules could jeopardize a lease. Condos are tightening security, asking doormen to scrutinize visitors and requiring residents to sign authorization forms for guests. The practice has also raised insurance concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What happens if one of these <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> guests starts a fire?'' asked Phyllis H. Weisberg, chairwoman of the Cooperative and Condominium Law Committee at the New York City Bar Association. ''Who's paying for that?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, as New Yorkers grow accustomed to a sharing economy, buildings might ultimately have to embrace it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''<span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> is here to stay,'' Mr. Gottsegen said. ''Instead of fighting it, we should wrap our arms around it and make it better.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-ops and Condos</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From maintenance to flip taxes, condo and co-op owners often complain of boards bleeding them dry. Unfortunately, the cost of running a building will not get any cheaper anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next few years, large residential buildings will have to comply with Local Law 87, which requires them to audit energy usage and keep systems running at peak efficiency. Residential buildings are the city's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 37 percent of the total. ''The one hot-button topic is energy. How do buildings become more energy efficient?'' said Dan Wurtzel, the president of FirstService Residential New York, which manages more than 500 properties. ''If a third of your operating budget is related to energy and you can now reduce that cost, you can take pressure off the need for a maintenance increase.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Complying with the law may prove challenging, even if improvements ultimately reduce long-term costs. In addition, 2015 is the deadline for buildings to convert from No. 6 heating oil to No. 4 oil, which is less polluting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Who's going to pay for that?'' said Marc J. Luxemburg, the president of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums. ''This has a real-world cost for many buildings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although various public incentives exist, many come in the form of tax breaks, low-interest loans or rebates. So a building might have to levy an assessment or raise maintenance to cover initial costs. ''You run into the problem of nobody giving you the money upfront,'' Mr. Luxemburg said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are just some of the issues that will face New Yorkers next year. And then there's the new drum set the neighbor's son received for Christmas ...</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average and the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index closed at new highs Monday as discouraging data on home sales failed to derail the markets' Santa rally, what traders often call a pre-Christmas advance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market delivered its fourth gain in four days. Pharmaceutical and technology stocks were among the big risers, while shares in energy companies fell sharply as the decline in oil prices deepened. Trading volume was lighter than usual as many investors looked ahead to the Christmas holiday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're getting a good Santa Claus rally,'' said Sam Stovall, U.S. equity strategist at <span class="companylink">S&amp;P Capital IQ</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a strong finish last week, investors remained mostly in a buying mood Monday. The major stock indexes drifted between small gains and losses in the morning, as traders digested a report by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> that sales of previously occupied homes fell 6.1 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.93 million, the slowest pace in six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By late morning, the major indexes were rising and holding on to gains that were modest, but good enough for a new set of highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index gained 7.89 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,078.54, eclipsing a high of 2,075.37 on Dec. 5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average rose 154.64, or 0.9 percent, to 17,959.44. Its last high was 17,958.79 on Dec. 5. The Nasdaq picked up 16.04 points, or 0.3 percent, to 4,781.42.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow</span> and S.&amp;P. 500 are both up for the month, while the Nasdaq is down. The three indexes are up for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market gains this year have been in line with that of previous years that were also preceded by strong growth, Mr. Stovall said. ''On average, the S.&amp;P. has gained 10 percent in the years following 20-plus-percent advances,'' he said. ''And we're doing just that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market is coming off a big advance last week, which gave the S.&amp;P. 500 its second-biggest weekly gain this year. The latest rally kicked off Wednesday, when the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen, eased investors' concerns that the central bank would soon start raising interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking ahead, trading volume is expected to thin out the next couple of days leading into Christmas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of traders and a lot of investors are going to take the whole week off and that might lead to some volatility,'' said Mike Serio, regional chief investment officer at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Private Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several economic barometers, including government reports on durable goods, personal income, consumer sentiment and the latest estimate of growth in the third quarter, are due out this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we see any of those numbers really off track, it might affect the market,'' Mr. Serio said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eight of the 10 sectors in the S.&amp;P. 500 index rose Monday, led by technology stocks. Health care and energy stocks declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">Achillion Pharmaceuticals</span> gained 9 percent after the biotechnology company reported positive results from two studies focusing on a treatment regimen for hepatitis C patients. The stock rose $1.28 to $15.49. Meanwhile, <span class="companylink">Enanta Pharmaceuticals</span> was up 10.1 percent after it received regulatory approval for a hepatitis C treatment. Enanta added $4.70 to $51.32.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drugmaker <span class="companylink">Gilead Sciences</span> tumbled 14.3 percent after the pharmacy benefits manager <span class="companylink">Express Scripts</span> said it would no longer cover two of Gilead's hepatitis C drugs as part of an effort to battle the high cost of treatment for the disease. Gilead slid $15.55 to $92.90.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News that <span class="companylink">Ocwen Financial</span>'s executive chairman will resign as part of a settlement that also provides $150 million to homeowners sent shares in the mortgage servicer down 26.9 percent. The stock shed $5.89 to $16.01.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of U.S. oil fell on expectations of a further buildup in supplies both in the U.S. and from <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> producers. Benchmark U.S. crude fell $1.26 to close at $55.26 a barrel in New York. Oil has plunged since peaking at $107 a barrel in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several oil production and exploration companies tumbled as the slide in oil prices deepened Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Nabors Industries</span> fell 53 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $13.10, while <span class="companylink">Chesapeake Energy</span> slid $1.44, or 7.3 percent, to $18.42. Range Resources shed $2.80, or 4.7 percent, to $57.07. <span class="companylink">Southwestern Energy</span> dropped $1.69, or 5.5 percent, to $29.31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other energy futures trading, wholesale gasoline fell 2.5 cents to close at $1.535 a gallon, while heating oil fell 1.1 cents to close at $1.951 a gallon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Natural gas fell 32 cents to close at $3.144 per 1,000 cubic feet. Natural gas has fallen 15 percent over the past three trading sessions to its lowest level since January 2013 on forecasts for milder winter weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.16 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metals prices closed lower. Gold fell $16.20 to $1,179.80 an ounce. Silver fell 34 cents to $15.69 an ounce and copper lost a penny to $2.87 a pound.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Fewer Americans bought homes in November as buying slid to its slowest pace in six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Monday that sales of existing homes fell 6.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.93 million. That was down from a revised annual pace of 5.26 million in October. In the last 12 months, sales have risen 2.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combination of higher home prices and relatively stagnant incomes has reduced affordability and restrained buying, and a recent decline in mortgage rates has yet to lure more consumers into the market. At the same time, fewer distressed properties and bargains, which tend to attract investors, are coming onto the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors estimate that 2014 sales will end up below 2013 levels. Sales have slumped much of this year after a three-year rally that followed the recession and the implosion of the housing market. Harsh weather crippled home buying in early 2014. Lower affordability, resulting from tight credit, rising home prices and essentially flat incomes, suppressed sales for the rest of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors have estimated that 4.94 million existing homes will be sold this year, down 3 percent from 5.09 million in 2013. Analysts say sales of roughly 5.5 million existing homes are common in a healthy real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price rose 5 percent over the last 12 months to $205,300. That is good for sellers, but creates an additional challenge for would-be buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of first-time buyers climbed to 31 percent last month from a recent average of 29 percent. Still, that is well below the 40 percent share that has been typical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November sales fell in all four major geographic regions: Northeast, Midwest, South and West. Purchases fell in the last 12 months for homes valued at less than $250,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes for sale also fell from October. In November, 2.09 million homes were listed for sale, down 6.7 percent from October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the weakness in sales has resulted from a healthier market. Just 9 percent of sales last month were because of foreclosures and short sales, compared with 14 percent last year. The share of purchases by investors was 15 percent in November, compared with 19 percent 12 months ago. This indicates that the market continues to recover from the housing bust, despite the absence of sales growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs suggest sales may improve in 2015. Mortgage rates have fallen sharply in the last few weeks, which should make homes more affordable. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped last week to 3.8 percent, from 3.93 percent the previous week. That was the lowest level since May 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates have fallen as investors have plowed their money into 10-year Treasury notes after being alarmed by plummeting oil prices and signs of slowing growth overseas. At the same time, consistent job growth has lowered the unemployment rate to 5.8 percent from 7 percent 12 months ago. Steady hiring should eventually raise pay at a pace meaningfully above inflation, which would help increase home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales may also pick up as the housing market continues to heal from the boom-and-bust of the last decade. Zillow, a real estate data provider, said last week that the proportion of homeowners with mortgages who owe more than their house is worth had fallen by almost half in the last two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices and foreclosures have reduced that figure. As more homeowners gain equity in their homes, they are more likely to list their homes for sale, keeping home prices in check and spurring more sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stan Humphries, Zillow's chief economist, forecasts that sales of existing homes will rise to 5.2 million next year from just under 5 million in 2014.</p>

</div><div class="author">By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ   </div><div>885 words</div><div>6 December 2014</div><div>International New York Times</div><div>INHT</div><div>9</div><div>English</div><div>© 2014 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employers added 321,000 jobs in the United States during November, a very healthy showing that echoed other positive economic data recently and bodes well for the crucial holiday retail season underway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unemployment rate remained unchanged from last month at 5.8 percent, the Labor Department said Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government statisticians also revised upward the number of jobs added in September and October by 44,000, another good sign. Significantly, average hourly earnings surged 0.4 percent in November, twice what economists had been expecting and a sign the healthier economy is finally translating into wage gains for ordinary workers. Over the past 12 months, however, earnings are up only 2.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street had been expecting payrolls to grow by 230,000 in November, with the unemployment rate remaining unchanged. November’s gain was the largest monthly jump in payrolls in nearly three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the deep economic frustration many Americans feel, evident in everything from public opinion surveys to water cooler chats to last month’s Congressional elections, the American economy has made significant progress this year. In November 2013, for instance, the unemployment rate was 7 percent, and the jobless rate five years ago this month was 9.9 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Federal Reserve survey of economic conditions across the country released Wednesday reported healthier consumer spending in many regions, likely as a result of lower gas prices, as well as gains in hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, average gasoline prices in the United States fell below $3 a gallon for the first time since 2010, amid a global plunge in crude prices. Crude oil has kept dropping since then, to about $66 a barrel, which suggests prices at the pump have further to drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of Monday, gas prices in the United States averaged $2.77 a gallon, according to the <span class="companylink">Energy Information Administration</span>, compared with $3.26 in December 2013. If gas prices stay where they are, the typical household will save roughly $600 over the next 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall expansion of the economy, as measured by the annual rate of growth in gross domestic product per quarter, has also been picking up steam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late November, the Commerce Department revised upward its estimate of the growth rate in the third quarter to 3.9 percent from an initial figure of 3.5 percent. Output rose at an annual rate of 4.6 percent in the second quarter, a snapback from the contraction in the first few months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street, too, has been surging, with stocks hitting highs repeatedly in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, the section of the economy that helped lead the way down — housing — has made an impressive recovery, at least in terms of home values, if not new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate sector could be dealt a setback if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates next year, as is widely expected, but in more affluent areas in particular, surging home prices have already helped restore much of the confidence that was shattered in the financial crisis of 2008 and the deep recession that followed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why the persistent gloom, not to mention anger?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the problem is that even though employment is back above pre-recession levels — the eight million jobs lost between 2008 and 2010 have been more than made up since then — millions of new workers have joined the work force over that period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What’s more, wage gains for the vast majority of Americans who kept their jobs throughout the downturn and then the recovery have been very modest. The 2 percent wage increase over the last year is barely enough to keep up with inflation or rising costs for many services, like education, insurance and health care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For wages to show meaningful gains over a sustained period of time, as was the case in the 1990s, the unemployment rate would likely have to drop below 5 percent, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Mesirow Financial</span> in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some highly skilled workers in sectors like technology and finance, wages have been rising sharply, as have stock holdings and 401(k) retirement plan portfolios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But unlike in the 1990s, the gains for the broad mass of middle-skilled and low-skilled workers have been scant, Ms. Swonk said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Some boats were lifted up more than others in the 1990s, but all boats did go up some back then,’’ she said. ‘‘That hasn’t been the case lately.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States trade deficit narrowed less than expected in October as lower crude oil prices failed to offset a jump in imports, government data showed Friday, while an increase in exports suggested the economy was weathering faltering global demand, Reuters reported from Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said the trade gap fell 0.4 percent to $43.4 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade deficit falling to $41.4 billion. Imports increased 0.9 percent in October to a record high of $241 billion. Petroleum imports were the lowest since November 2009. Exports increased 1.2 percent to $197.5 billion in October, with a 36 percent rise in the value of goods shipped to China.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Starts for single-family homes in the United States rose for a second straight month in October, and overall building permits approached a level last seen in 2008, suggesting the housing market was still on a recovery path.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that groundbreaking for single-family homes, which account for more than two-thirds of the housing market, increased 4.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual 696,000-unit pace, the highest since last November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family starts in the South, where more than half of that segment's construction occurs, increased to their highest level since April 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a 15.4 percent plunge in the volatile multifamily homes part of the market caused overall groundbreaking to fall 2.8 percent to a pace of 1.009 million units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September's starts also were revised to a rate of 1.038 million units from the previously reported pace of 1.017 million units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the housing recovery will probably remain subdued given sluggish wage growth and still stringent lending practices by financial institutions, the strong gains in single-family starts suggest home building will contribute to gross domestic product in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The segment added nothing to G.D.P. in the July-September period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The theme in housing market activity remains one of gradual improvement as underlying fundamentals continue to pick up,'' said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed that applications for loans to buy homes surged last week as low mortgage rates lured potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, building permits jumped 4.8 percent to a pace of 1.080 million units, the highest since June 2008. It was the second straight month of gains in permits, which lead starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits for single-family homes rose 1.4 percent to a 640,000-unit pace. Permits for multifamily housing surged 10 percent to a 440,000-unit pace.</p>

</div><div class="author">By HIROKO TABUCHI </div><div>684 words</div><div>19 November 2014</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Depot [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/home_depot_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org], the country’s largest home-improvement retailer, booked robust gains in sales and profit in its third quarter, as a brightening economic picture spurred more people to buy homes and renovate them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those gains appeared to ease concerns that an expansive data breach at the retailer would scare customers away before the critical holiday sales season. Uncertainties over how much the breach could ultimately cost <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, however, coupled with conservative guidance from the company for the full year, caused investors to tread cautiously after the market opened. <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> said in its guidance that extra losses from the breach “cannot be estimated at this time.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, which is based in Atlanta and operates almost 2,300 stores in North America, said that hackers had targeted its payment terminals, possibly compromising some 56 million customers [http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/18/home-depot-says-data-from-56-million-cards-taken-in-breach/]’ credit or debit card data. The breach raised concerns that customers would hold back spending at the retailer, especially on larger-ticket purchases typically made by credit or debit cards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the retailer’s net earnings [http://ir.homedepot.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=63646&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1990548] for the third quarter came to $1.5 billion, or $1.15 per diluted share, beating analysts’ expectations by 2 cents a share. The retailer reported net earnings of $1.4 billion, or 95 cents per diluted share, for the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales for the quarter climbed 5.4 percent from the same period last year, to $20.5 billion. Comparable store sales rose 5.2 percent over all and 5.8 percent at United States stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“During the quarter, we saw strong performance across all geographies, led by growth in transactions and continued strength in the core of the store,” Craig Menear, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>’s chief executive and president, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Menear later told analysts that it was difficult for <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> to determine whether the data breach had any impact on the quarter’s sales. “But we were very pleased we had positive transaction growth in each month in the quarter. We feel this shows customer confidence in <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>,” he said on a conference call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Lasser, an analyst at <span class="companylink">UBS</span>, said in a note after the earnings announcement that he believed <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>’s sales “were relatively consistent month-to-month, suggesting the data breach didn’t really have a profound impact on its performance.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving sales at <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> has been a broad recovery in the American economy and a rebound in home sales, on which demand for power tools, flooring and other home improvement goods is dependent. In addition, job growth and lower gasoline prices have bolstered consumers’ confidence. Home sales climbed 2.4 percent in September from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.17 million, the highest level of the year and the fifth increase in six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third-quarter results reflected a pretax gain of $100 million related to the sale of a portion of its ownership in <span class="companylink">HD Supply Holdings</span>, its professional services division. They also reflected $28 million in expenses related to the data breach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the retailer is still tallying costs of the breach, said Carol B. Tomé, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>’s chief financial officer. She said known expenses related to the attack, including legal costs and spending on IT defenses, would cost $27 million more in the fourth quarter, or $6 million after an expected insurance reimbursement. For the year, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> expects to pay $34 million in costs related to the breach outside insurance reimbursement, Ms. Tomé said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> kept its outlook for the year unchanged, saying it expected diluted earnings per share to grow 21 percent, to about $4.54 a share, on sales growth of about 4.8 percent. That appeared to be a conservative estimate, given the executives’ bullish tone before the holidays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tomé said that she was impressed so far by November sales, and that the colder weather was helping to drive even more sales from consumers’ protecting their homes from severe weather.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- SEVEN years after the housing bubble burst, federal regulators backed away this month from the tougher mortgage-underwriting standards that the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 had directed them to develop. New standards were supposed to raise the quality of the ''prime'' mortgages that get packaged and sold to investors; instead, they will have the opposite effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Responding to the law, federal regulators proposed tough new standards in 2011, but after bipartisan outcries from <span class="companylink">Congress</span> and fierce lobbying by interested parties, including community activists, the Obama administration and the real estate and banking industries -- all eager to increase home sales -- the standards have been watered down. The regulators had wanted a down payment of 20 percent, a good credit record and a maximum debt-to-income ratio of 36 percent. But under pressure, they dropped the down payment and good-credit requirements and agreed to a debt-to-income limit as high as 43 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regulators believe that lower underwriting standards promote homeownership and make mortgages and homes more affordable. The facts, however, show that the opposite is true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the late '80s and early '90s, down payments were 10 to 20 percent. The homeownership rate was 64 percent -- about where it is now -- and nearly 90 percent of housing markets were considered affordable (that is, home prices were no more than three times family income). By 2011 only 50 percent were considered affordable, and by 2014, just 36 percent -- even though down payments as low as 5 percent are now common.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How could this be? Consider this: If the required down payment for a mortgage is 10 percent, a potential home buyer with $10,000 can purchase a $100,000 home. But if the down payment is dropped to 5 percent, the same buyer can purchase a $200,000 home. The buyer is taking more risk by borrowing more, but can afford to bid more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, low underwriting standards -- especially low down payments -- drive housing prices up, making them less affordable for low- and moderate-income buyers, while also inducing would-be homeowners to take more risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why homes were more affordable before the 1990s than they are today. Back then, when traditional standards for ''prime'' mortgages prevailed, homes were smaller; they had fewer bathrooms, and the kitchens were not appointed by Martha Stewart. A family could buy and live in a ''starter home'' for several years before selling it and using the accumulated equity to buy a bigger or better appointed home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a competitive housing market not subsidized by lax standards, home builders would similarly adjust by reducing the size and amenities of new homes to meet the financial resources of home buyers entering the market. Home prices would stabilize and not rise faster than incomes. Low- and moderate-income families and millennials might have to wait to save for a first home, but they would be able to afford it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Higher down payments are not the only way to limit excessive borrowing. The ''standard'' 30-year mortgage is a subsidized, archaic result of our government's distorted housing policies; very few home buyers stay in a home for 30 years. A 15-year fixed-rate mortgage means higher monthly payments, but the homeowner starts to accumulate equity sooner, reducing the lender's risk.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the government got out of the way, would sound underwriting standards come back? History suggests yes. Although <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> were government-backed, they were shareholder-owned, profit-making firms. They adopted strong underwriting standards to avoid the credit risk of subprime and other high-risk mortgages. But after <span class="companylink">Congress</span> enacted affordable-housing goals, administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, in 1992, underwriting standards declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans generally favor eliminating the government's role in housing finance, while Democrats worry that without government support, mortgages would be too expensive for low- and moderate-income families. Although it runs counter to the current Washington view, good underwriting standards can satisfy the objectives of both parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's clear that today's policies create winners and losers. The winners include real estate agents and home builders, who want to increase borrowing and sell ever-larger and more expensive homes. The losers, as we saw in the financial crisis, are borrowers of modest means who are lured into financing arrangements they can't afford. When the result is foreclosure and eviction, one of the central goals of homeownership -- building equity -- is undone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the financial crisis, Representative Barney Frank -- the Massachusetts Democrat who led the <span class="companylink">House Financial Services Committee</span> during the crisis, and a champion of credit programs for low-income buyers -- admitted, ''It was a great mistake to push lower-income people into housing they couldn't afford and couldn't really handle once they had it.'' Policy makers who support homeownership would be wise to consider who is hurt and who is helped when we abandon traditional underwriting standards.</p>
