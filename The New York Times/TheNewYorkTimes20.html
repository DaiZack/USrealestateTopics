<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America's home-buying season, when for-sale signs sprout like dandelions, is shaping up to be even worse than expected this year, with prices falling, sales slowing and few signs of a turnaround emerging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two reports released on Tuesday captured the bleak picture. One showed that home prices nationally fell 14.1 percent in March from a year earlier. The other showed sales of new homes, although up slightly in April, remained mired near their lowest levels since 1991.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Wall Street is growing hopeful that the economy may dodge a recession, many economists warn that the pain in the housing market may last for several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even markets that once seemed immune to the slump, like Seattle, are weakening. Prices nationwide might fall as much as 10 percent more before a recovery takes hold, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the home-buying season enters what is traditionally its busiest period, there are simply too many homes in many parts of the country, and too few people with the means to buy them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation is likely to get worse because a rising tide of foreclosures is flooding the market with even more homes, while a slack economy and tight mortgage market are reducing the pool of potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like eating beyond your stomach's capacity,'' said Ronald J. Peltier, the chief executive of Home Services of America, which owns real estate brokerage firms across the country. ''We have huge indigestion.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers confront a sober reality: There are more than 4.5 million homes on the market nationwide. The way houses are selling, it would take nearly 11 months to clear the market. The last time so many homes were for sale was in the early 1980s, when the economy was in a deep recession and interest rates were two to four times as high as they are today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory is not spread out evenly across the country. Manhattan and choice neighborhoods in San Francisco and downtown Boston, for example, do not appear to be suffering from the kind of glut that is hurting suburban Phoenix, southern Florida and inland areas of California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan, prices do not seem to be falling, even though sales dropped 23 percent in April and the first half of May, compared with the same period a year ago, according to Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm. The number of units available for sale has risen by 11 percent, to 6,859.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some other cities, like Dallas, Houston and Charlotte, N.C., where home prices did not surge this decade, are not hurting as much either. Charlotte and Dallas were the only areas out of 20 key markets that registered higher prices in March than February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, however, sales of existing single family homes tumbled 20 percent in the first four months of the year from the comparable period a year ago and are running at their lowest levels since 1998. Sales of new homes have fallen 42 percent over the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported on Tuesday that sales increased 3.3 percent in April from March, when sales tumbled 11 percent, although the increase largely reflected a statistical revision to the earlier figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Seattle, where housing had held up better than much of the rest of the country in the last two years, home sales have slowed sharply. Sales in King County, which includes Seattle, fell more than 33 percent in April from the same month a year earlier while the number of homes for sale is up 55 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of single-family homes have fallen about 6.5 percent from their peak in July 2007 to February, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller index, which tracks prices nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As in other regions, the slowdown is hitting outlying areas first and hardest. Sales and prices are still robust in Seattle and affluent suburbs like Bellevue because they are more desirable and closer to big employers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are still getting multiple offers on properties there,'' Phil Rodocker, a Seattle-based real estate agent, said about the downtown area and Bellevue. But ''as you move south, every 10 miles south you go, you see more and more short sales and repossessed houses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are having trouble selling units in some newer condominium buildings. Mr. Rodocker got an e-mail message from one developer last week who a few months ago had quickly sold 251 units in a project under construction. Now, investors who had signed contracts to buy 40 of those units had reneged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The units in the Belltown section of Seattle are now being resold for as little as $225,950 for a one-bedroom apartment with one bathroom, prices that Mr. Rodocker said were so low as to be ''ridiculous.'' Last fall, one-bedroom condos in the neighborhood were selling for $260,000 to $290,000, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeing the number of homes on the market rise and prices fall, buyers are becoming more picky and negotiating harder, he and other agents said. Lower prices usually spur demand, but many buyers are waiting because they think prices will fall farther.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Mr. Rodocker's clients, Dennis Humphrey, lives south of Seattle in Tukwila and has been looking to buy a home with three or four bedrooms and one or two bathrooms. Parents of 10-year-old twin boys, Mr. Humphrey and his wife live in a rental home and want a bigger place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Humphrey, who works in the home improvement division of Sears, has made offers on two homes, but the sellers have refused to negotiate. He is willing to spend up to $300,000 and has enough money to put 20 percent down, but Mr. Humphrey said he was worried prices were going to fall farther and could wipe out any money he puts into a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am not afraid of the monthly mortgage payment, and I am not afraid of taxes, but I am afraid of losing the value I am putting in,'' he said. ''I believe the right deal will come along, and I am in no rush,'' He added</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 35 miles south, outside Tacoma, Irene Foster-Worthy and her husband have received no offers on their three-bedroom, two-bath ranch home since they put it on the market a month ago. The couple plan to retire to a home they are buying on an island near the Canadian border to be closer to their children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Only about four people have come to see it, which makes it difficult to sell,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some buyers seem to be waiting, many others have been locked out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since early 2007, lenders have sharply scaled back the easy-lending policies that powered the boom. Most lenders are now making only loans that conform to the standards set by Fannie Mae, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> or the Federal Housing Administration, which all require either a substantial down payments or mortgage insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Once the credit pendulum starts swinging from too easy, it never stops at neutral -- it goes to too tight,'' said Lou Barnes, a mortgage broker in Boulder, Colo., who said he was turning down about two applicants a week. During the boom, he rarely had to turn down borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts say the scrutiny is well deserved even if it slows borrowing and home sales because it will assure better loans are made. Compared with standards over a long period of time, these people say, lending guidelines are not all that conservative; it is just that the nation became accustomed to credit at easy terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One could say there is less money available,'' said Marc McGree, a real estate consultant outside Washington. ''But today's standards really aren't so different from eight years ago or so, before the market overheated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Better lending and cheaper prices should eventually restore balance to the market, economists say. From their peak, prices have already fallen 16 percent, more than half the way to the 25 percent drop that the economists at <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> expect, for instance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, sales have increased in some areas with high foreclosure rates like Las Vegas. The increase reflects a rise in the sales of repossessed homes by lenders at lowered prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real estate officials say places like Boston, which led the national downturn, may be approaching a bottom. Home prices there appear to be falling more slowly than before, and the number of homes for sale declined in the first quarter. J. Patrick Lashinsky, chief executive of ZipRealty, the real estate brokerage firm, says his agents are seeing more buyers shopping for homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Places ''that did not have huge run-ups or were very early are doing well,'' he said. ''Boston is one of those.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, sales of single-family homes and condos fell by more than a third in the first three months of the year, compared with the same period in 2007, according to the Greater Boston Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward E. Leamer, a professor of economics and statistics at the University of California, Los Angeles, said this real estate downturn was playing out differently than the one in the early 1990s, when prices fell gradually over several years in Los Angeles, New York and elsewhere. The sharper and more rapid decline now probably reflects the impact of easy lending during the recent boom. As a result, it might also augur for a somewhat faster recovery, but Mr. Leamer is not ready to predict when that will be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You will eventually get to the point where you will find a market equilibrium,'' he said. But ''the economist's model for supply and demand doesn't tell you how long it will take to get there.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM   </div><div>866 words</div><div>24 May 2008</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks took a dive on Friday after a report confirmed fears that the housing slump, which has weighed on nearly every corner of the nation's economy, was nowhere near its end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes, which make up the bulk of the housing market, dipped 1 percent in April, to an annual rate of 4.89 million, the second consecutive month that sales have declined. That figure represents another record low, although the report, put out by the private National Association of Realtors, dates only to 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While sales were slightly better than economists had expected, Wall Street was unimpressed. The Dow Jones industrials dropped 146 points on Friday, capping the worst week in the stock markets since February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow closed at 12,479.63, down more than 500 points from Monday's opening bell. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index, a broader measure of the American stock market, also stumbled, slipping again on Friday to finish down 3.5 percent for the week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond prices rose as investors turned to the safety of government notes. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 18/32, to 100 8/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 3.84 percent, from 3.91 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a period of relative calm on Wall Street, investors seemed shaken by the resurgence of economic problems on several fronts. Oil, which some thought had reached a plateau at $110 a barrel, suddenly surged on reports that experts had decided dwindling supplies would not be able to keep up with global demand. Oil settled on Friday at $132.19 a barrel, up nearly $6 since Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of oil, which affects not only the cost of gasoline but also the price of common consumer products, has risen nearly $20 a barrel in May alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high cost of fuel is driving fears that inflation will become unhinged. Consumers are already being squeezed by skyrocketing prices for food and gasoline, and a report this week showed businesses were forced to pay more for wholesale goods in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home sales report on Friday topped off a dreary week. The median value of a previously owned home was $202,300 in April, down 8 percent from a year ago, the realty group said on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners have watched their property values plunge for months, although the slump comes after several years of a remarkable run-up in home prices. Still, economists say they believe the declines have discouraged purchases, as would-be buyers hold out for prices to fall further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Lower prices bring bargain hunters into the market,'' Patrick Newport, an economist at Global Insight, a research firm, wrote. ''But they also drive away buyers who view their homes as an investment. In today's market, the fence sitters outnumber the bargain hunters.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories also ticked up in April. At the current sales rate, it would take nearly a year to clear out the current backlog of unsold homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts fear that an increase in foreclosures will only add to the inventory overhang, pushing prices down further. Economists expect no substantial recovery in the housing market until at least the latter half of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The sharp increase in inventories will continue to keep potential buyers out of the market and depress overall prices further,'' Joseph Brusuelas, the chief economist of Merk Investments, wrote in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A loss of confidence among lenders has also put a damper on sales, as even Americans eager to buy a home are having difficulty procuring mortgages from lenders who have tightened their standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report divides sales figures into four general regions of the country. According to the realty group, April sales dropped 6 percent in the Midwest and 4.4 percent in the Northeast, but rose 6.4 percent in the West. Sales stayed steady in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest decline came in sales of apartments and condominiums, which plunged 5.2 percent after two months of rising sales. Demand for single-family homes dropped 0.5 percent in April, according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets will be closed Monday for the Memorial Day holiday, but the subsequent four days will bring a more detailed look at the troubles in the housing market. The closely watched Case-Shiller index, scheduled to be released on Tuesday, will offer a snapshot of home prices across the country in March. The Commerce Department will also report on Tuesday on sales of new homes in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports are also due next week on consumer spending, personal income growth, durable goods orders and consumer confidence. A revised government estimate of economic growth in the first quarter will be released on Thursday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WITH a laser measuring device clipped to his belt and a reel of yellow tape tucked under one arm, Christopher Otteau roamed around a tidy house on a corner lot in Ridgewood, N.J., preparing to deliver the unwelcome news to its occupants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They, like many other homeowners whose property Mr. Otteau has appraised lately, were hoping to hear that their special house in their special neighborhood in their special town was immune to the gravitational force that has been pulling down home prices from coast to coast. Mr. Otteau's oft-repeated response: Sorry, but we are all in this housing slump together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days even a well-kept house like this one, in a desirable town like Ridgewood, is likely to sell for a price that disappoints its owners. The five-bedroom ranch with a swimming pool was listed for more than $1.1 million, but Mr. Otteau, who is usually hired by the lender holding the mortgage, was just beginning to hunt for flaws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In a tough market, nothing is overlooked,'' he said as he examined a shallow hole near the front door where a tree had been planted. ''In a good market, lots of things are.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clipboard in hand, he assessed everything from the topography of the lot (''slightly sloping'') to the type of street it bordered (a ''main feeder''). He gave it extra points for its curved stone walkway, which, he said, ''enhances curb appeal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He would have to find out how much other houses in the neighborhood had sold for recently before he could fix a specific value on the home. But one conclusion was inescapable: On the section of the appraisal form that describes the condition of the local housing market, he would check the box for ''declining.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suburbs of New York City were late entrants in the downturn that some economists think is already a recession. The main cause of the current weakness was the bursting of the American housing bubble, which had been pumped up by several years of hyper-aggressive lending and borrowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although prices rose much faster in newly developing parts of the Sun Belt, house values doubled in the metropolitan area, too, rising to $450,000 in 2005 from about $225,000 in 2000, according to the National Association of Realtors. Now, a reversal is well under way, but the concept is sinking in slowly for most residents of the area with property to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who have owned their homes since the start of the decade became accustomed to a steady, rapid appreciation. Buyers were lining up to tour houses and waging bidding wars that drove prices well above what sellers were asking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In 2005, it was almost impossible to overprice a home,'' said Mr. Otteau, 29, who has been appraising property from northern New Jersey to Delaware for six years since joining the real estate business that his father has operated for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the tide turned more than two years ago, he said. With prices rising so much faster than people's incomes, houses started to become unaffordable and, he said, demand waned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, home values statewide have declined about 15 percent and, he estimated, they will fall an additional 5 percent over the next year. In many towns, the inventory of unsold homes has been rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But new statistics last week showed that sales volume increased statewide in New Jersey by about 4 percent in the first quarter of this year, compared with the same period last year, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has softened considerably in the suburbs north and east of New York City as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Long Island, the number of home sales in March was almost one-third lower than in March 2007, according to the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island. The median price of those homes fell to $409,000 last month, down more than 8 percent from $445,000 the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Nassau County, almost a full year's supply of inventory was for sale as of March, up from a little more than eight months' worth a year ago, according to the service. In Suffolk County, it said, almost 15 months' inventory was for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Westchester County, sales of single-family homes fell more than 30 percent and sales of condos plunged almost 35 percent during the first quarter of 2008, the sharpest decline in 28 years of record-keeping by the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service. In Putnam County, however, sales dropped by 9 percent, and prices fell 5 percent, according to the service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westchester's real estate market is effectively on hold as prospective sellers wait for a better time to list their homes, said P. Gilbert Mercurio, chief executive of the Westchester County Board of Realtors. ''You have to be aware that there are a lot of people who may want to sell property but don't have to do it at a particular time,'' Mr. Mercurio said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sooner sellers let go of their dreams of cashing out at prices they once might have gotten, the sooner the market will stabilize, Mr. Otteau said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If people want to sell, they've got to get real with their prices,'' he said. Even then, he added, ''it's not going to be this everybody-rush-in market. It's going to be a cautious market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau may be too young to recall the ravages of the last severe housing slump in the New York metropolitan area. The median price of a home in the New York metropolitan area fell about 10 percent between 1988 and 1995, according to the National Association of Realtors. But he can fall back on the collected wisdom of his father, Jeffrey, who has been tracking New Jersey's property market for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, Jeffrey Otteau has been the monthly bearer of bad tidings for New Jersey's builders and real estate agents. His company, Otteau Valuation Group, publishes town-by-town reports on the state of the housing market and, lately, the figures have looked progressively bleaker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of home-sale contracts signed in the state in March was down 27 percent from March 2007, according to the company's latest report. Growing fears about job losses, especially the waves of cutbacks announced by Wall Street firms, are compounding the weakening demand, Jeffrey Otteau said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now, everything is in a stall,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, there are towns where demand is relatively strong and some houses are attracting multiple bids. But they represent a ''small, small sliver'' of the region, said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of those pockets of stability are directly linked to New York City, which has been the ''economic engine of the region for the last four years,'' Mr. Hughes said. Towns along the rail lines radiating from Manhattan, like Chatham and West Windsor, had some of the highest rates of home appreciation during the recent expansion, Mr. Hughes said. And those towns that have train stations and also lie near major highways, like Summit, received a double bonus, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you live in those communities, for two working spouses it's the ideal location because you can satisfy one person working in New York and one working in New Jersey,'' Mr. Hughes said. Mr. Hughes said that even though more suburban residents throughout the region commute within the suburbs than travel back and forth to New York City, the closer-in communities have held up better because the city's economy has kept growing faster than the rest of the region's. With the financial services industry that powers New York City in the midst of a broad downshift, the staying power of that trend is now in question, Mr. Hughes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the cutbacks on Wall Street turn out to be part of a short, cyclical downturn, proximity to Manhattan may continue to be a prime determinant of home values, he said. But if it is the start of a ''long-term structural shift,'' he said, ''it's possible we could see a major long-term weakness in New York, and that would ripple through all these housing markets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even traditional destinations for investment bankers and lawyers decamping from the city, like Summit, in Union County, N.J., could suffer during a protracted downturn, Jeffrey Otteau said. ''The reliance on Manhattan overflow housing demand has, up until now, been a strength for Summit,'' he said. ''We now need to see how much weakness there will be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, a business group, said she believes that on Long Island, ''communities that have rail linkages or other forms of public transit will hold up better in terms of value than other areas that are completely auto-dependent.'' But Mr. Mercurio said he had seen no evidence of a similar pattern in suburbs north of New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the data he collects and analyzes, Jeffrey Otteau has several sets of eyes scrutinizing the market, house by house and building by building. One pair belongs to his son, Christopher, who logs more than 40,000 miles a year on his Lexus hybrid as he traverses the region appraising property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a soft market, like the current one, sellers can improve their prospects by dressing up their homes, Christopher Otteau said. Uncluttered houses are much more appealing, he said. ''We always recommend getting a storage unit and getting all that stuff out of the way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that ''updated kitchens and updated bathrooms definitely add value,'' but added that owners could go too far in upgrading an entry-level home. Installing expensive cabinetry, appliances and marble tile in a smaller house is often a mistake, he said. ''In entry level, it's called overimprovement or superadequacy,'' he said, using appraisers' language for spending money that is unlikely to be recouped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing owners routinely place too much value on is having a larger-than-average lot, he said. ''If it's not buildable, it's just excess acreage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just after dawn one day this spring, in Bernards Township, he hiked to the top of a hill on a 10-acre lot near Basking Ridge whose owner had scrapped a plan to build a house and had put it up for sale for $1.2 million. The property, with a creek running through it, was ''one of the most beautiful lots I've ever seen,'' he said. ''In 2005, it probably would have sold in a heartbeat.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An hour later, he was touring a house in Mendham, then he was on to another in Long Hill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each property had its own strengths and weaknesses, and, ultimately, the selling price of each would be determined by how many potential buyers it attracted and what they were willing to pay. Christopher Otteau said he could not discuss the particulars of his valuation of any of them. But in each case, he said, it was almost certainly true that they would sell for less than they would have at the peak of the market a few years ago, and less than their owners had hoped to collect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he breaks that news to them, he tries to do it ''nicely,'' he said, and they seem to find his candor ''refreshing.'' Often, the response he hears these days, he said, is ''At least you're honest.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WINIFRED WILKINS did not need numbers to tell her about the state of real estate in Connecticut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's terrible,'' said Ms. Wilkins, 78, of Branford. Her house has been on the market 1 1/2 years, the first six months with an agent. Now she's trying to sell what she considers her biggest retirement account on her own so she can move to North Carolina to live near her family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is money out there -- but people are very afraid in this present economy,'' Ms. Wilkins said. ''They don't want to be tied to a big mortgage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The statistics are grim. After bucking the national downturn last year, Connecticut single family home sales and median home prices (excluding condos) slid dramatically in 2008's first quarter, according to data from the Warren Group of Boston, which tracks real estate in New England.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Statewide, first-quarter sales were down more than 27 percent from the same period last year and median prices were down nearly 6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fairfield County, which typically has more home sales than any other state county, as well as the highest prices, absorbed the worst of it. Sales for the quarter were off nearly 32 percent and March sales were not only down 37 percent, but were also outpaced by Hartford and New Haven Counties. Median prices were down 8.5 percent for the quarter and more than 10 percent in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state's only bright spot was the median sales price in Litchfield County, which went up slightly, though overall sales were down about 30 percent for the quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vincent Valvo, the Warren Group's publisher and a West Hartford homeowner, said that foreclosures in the state as well as the overall subprime mortgage crisis has had a ripple effect by flushing about one-third of potential buyers out of the market -- people, Mr. Valvo said, who should not have been in the market in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We created artificial demand by creating artificial buyers,'' he said. ''It takes a while for all this stuff to really show up in the market place. Now that we've hit the spring buying season, Fairfield County comes in with the worst performance, and it's absolutely nightmarish given past performances.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home prices in Connecticut peaked last June at $325,000. At the end of March, they stood at $268,250. The drop between March 2007 and March 2008 was the largest single monthly decline since April 1995.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we're seeing is a stalemate between buyers and sellers,'' said Joe Piscitelli of Coldwell Banker in Milford, a specialist in luxury waterfront property in New Haven County who said inventory was about 2 1/2 times higher than normal. ''They're looking each other in the eye and not drawing their weapons.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other agents around the state report the same standoff, with buyers looking for bargains but sellers still seeking last year's high prices. Those same agents say, however, that when sellers price homes appropriately for the new scaled-back market, houses go quickly, with multiple offers at their asking prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I tell people if you overprice it you're dead,'' said Barbara Pearce of H. Pearce Company Realtors in North Haven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bellina Lim, 31, heeded that advice when she had to put her Southington home on the market last month after her husband accepted a job transfer to China. ''I was thinking the market has been slow, are we going to be able to sell the house?'' she said. Her house sold in four days, at the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The mantra used to be location, location, location,'' said Kenneth DelVecchio, president of the Connecticut Association of Realtors and a broker at RE/MAX Heritage in Westport. ''The mantra now is price, condition and location, and the houses that are priced right are selling.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said first-time homebuyers facing tougher lending practices found it difficult to get into the market. But he noted that in Fairfield County, the cap on FHA mortgages recently increased to $709,00 from $417,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Housing prices are low and interest rates are low,'' said Beverly Walsh of William Raveis Real Estate, Mortgage and Insurance. ''I look out the window and say 'Wow, I should be buying.' ''</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Even in the Hamptons, Homes Are Slow to Sell</span>
</div><div class="author">By VALERIE COTSALAS   </div><div>977 words</div><div>18 May 2008</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOME sales on Long Island continued to slide in the first quarter of 2008, with even the usually resilient East End vacation market falling on sluggish times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An increasing number of foreclosure filings may also have a long-term impact on prices, some experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Nassau County, there were 502 foreclosure filings in April 2008, 113 percent higher than in April 2007, according to RealtyTrac, an Internet-based firm that tracks foreclosures nationwide. In Suffolk, the number of foreclosure filings rose to 734 -- 43 percent higher than in April last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many facing foreclosure will put their homes up for sale at discounts that will ''become a drag on the market,'' said Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, a business organization. ''They will add to the numbers of homes for sale and add downward pressure on selling prices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For that reason, and because of tighter lending restrictions, she predicted that in the coming year home prices will ''decline at a faster rate than what we're seeing now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with March, median prices in April showed an increase of 1.4 percent in Suffolk, to $370,000, and about a half percent in Nassau, to $447,000. But compared with April 2007, they fell 7.5 percent in Suffolk and 5.5 percent in Nassau, according to a report from the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comparisons with the first quarter of last year were in line with the national trend. In the first quarter of this year, the median sales price of existing single-family homes nationwide was down 7.7 percent from the first quarter of 2007, the National Association of Realtors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More marked declines were in the number of actual home sales: down 28 percent in Nassau and 27 percent in Suffolk in April, compared with the same month last year, the Multiple Listing Service report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason so many homes are lingering on the market is that buyers feel prices ''haven't hit bottom yet,'' said Kathy Anastasio, the owner of Anastasio Associates, a Huntington real estate firm. Because mortgage rates keep going lower, she said, buyers see no reason to buy now. Still, she said, high-end homes in areas she covers, including Fort Salonga and the Village of Northport, are selling at close to their $1 million and $2 million asking prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Ms. Anastasio said she had encountered only one foreclosure sale recently, price discounts of 10 percent are not uncommon, she said, noting that she had not seen discounts reach that level in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many brokers say that homes take longer to sell -- six months and more -- and that those priced too high will sit on the market until the price goes down. As a result, many sellers have been more willing to negotiate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the affluent North Shore in Nassau, from Kings Point to Laurel Hollow, north of the Long Island Expressway and Route 25, buyers in the first quarter, on average, paid 13.4 percent less than sellers' last asking prices, nearly four percentage points higher than in the same quarter last year, according to a report by Miller Samuel, a Manhattan appraisal firm, for Prudential Douglas Elliman. The number of homes sold there fell by 14 percent compared with the first quarter of 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In upscale neighborhoods on Long Island, price declines have been greater simply because the homeowners have more leeway to reduce selling prices,'' Dr. Kamer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the East End, first-quarter sales on the North and South Forks declined by 41.4 percent, down to 400 from 683 in the first quarter last year. The number of homes on the market rose 25.5 percent, to 1,848, the Miller Samuel report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eye-popping price increases continued in parts of the Hamptons, but homes priced at near or less than $10 million, even new homes built by speculators, were lingering on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rich Gherardi, of Sand Dollar Development Corporation in East Hampton, is finishing an 11,000-square-foot house built on speculation. So far, no buyers have appeared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To draw more visitors to the house, 25 interior designers will decorate its rooms for a charity showcase in July. But Mr. Gherardi said it was the big-ticket features that he hoped would bring a sale: solar panels and a geothermal heating and cooling system. Alternative energy sources appeal to wealthy buyers, he said, and he estimated they would save $60,000 a year in utility bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In this kind of market, you have to do whatever you have to do to sell something,'' Mr. Gherardi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite some spectacular sales in the Hamptons, the number of sales is noticeably down compared with last year, said Gary DePersia, a senior vice president with Corcoran's East Hampton real estate office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People have the money, it's just the confidence factor,'' he said. ''They're hesitant to spend the money because they don't want to be the only guy at the cocktail party who spent a lot of money on a declining market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In western Suffolk and Nassau Counties, foreclosures are threatening not only lower-income communities, Dr. Kamer said, but also middle-income areas including Baldwin, Valley Stream and Bellmore in Nassau, and Huntington, Smithtown and Selden in Suffolk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest challenge, Dr. Kamer said, ''is to stop the wave of foreclosures and keep people in their homes as long as possible to prevent serious damage to the Long Island economy.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE real estate troubles that have been plaguing the rest of the nation are now hitting hard in Westchester, with markedly fewer sales, according to a report released last month by the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Westchester, there was a 31 percent drop in the number of sales during the first quarter of this year, to 1,340 from 1,927 during the same period last year. That is the largest year-over-year decrease since the listing service began keeping records in 1980.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the median price of a single-family house in Westchester remained fairly steady -- down 2 percent, to $622,500, for the first quarter of this year, compared with $635,000 a year ago. The comparisons with the first quarter of last year were in contrast with the national trend. In the first quarter of this year, the median price of existing single-family homes nationwide was down 7.7 percent from the first quarter of 2007, the National Association of Realtors reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relative stability of prices in Westchester may be linked to a decrease in inventory, which, at 5,903 houses on March 31, was 14 percent below 2007's first-quarter level, the Multiple Listing Service said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason, said P. Gilbert Mercurio, the chief executive of the Westchester County Board of Realtors and writer of the report, is that unlike many areas, Westchester has ''an above-average number of homeowners with considerable control over whether and when to list their properties for sale.'' Many homeowners -- among them, empty nesters -- appear able to wait out the downturn, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, foreclosure on homes has not resulted in a flood of new inventory, even though the foreclosure rate in the county has more than doubled in the past year. But the report cautions that the foreclosure problem has not played itself out and could spread.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 759 foreclosure filings in Westchester in the first quarter of 2008, compared with 530 for the first quarter of 2007, 378 during the first quarter of 2006 and 244 for the same period in 2005, according to the county clerk's office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not all filings result in foreclosure actions. Some prospective foreclosures are resolved through refinancing or other means, like short sales -- when an owner and lender agree to sell a house for a reduced price to satisfy the mortgage. In other cases, investors buy properties before they reach the open market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the foreclosure activity has been focused in less-affluent areas of the county in cities including Mount Vernon, Yonkers and New Rochelle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, the high end of the market appears to be holding its own, said Harding Mason, president of the County Board of Realtors and an associate broker in Houlihan Lawrence's Katonah office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of a single-family house (as opposed to the median, which represents the middle of the price spectrum) rose about 4 percent, to $935,556, in the first quarter, an indication that some high-priced transactions were in the mix, he said. Houses selling for $1 million or more accounted for 31 percent of first-quarter sales compared with 21 percent in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other sectors of the housing market also experienced downturns. Sales of condominiums were down by almost 35 percent, to 209 from 319 in the first quarter last year. The first-quarter median sale price for condos was $380,000, or 3 percent below last year's level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of co-ops declined 18.9 percent, to 343, from 423 in the previous year's first quarter. The price of co-ops also declined, with a drop of about 5 percent for the median since last year, to $176,000 from $185,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mason said that despite the numbers, he was optimistic about the housing market, noting that it seemed stronger in April. ''Some buyers,'' he said, ''will see this as a good opportunity to make an investment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Ginsburg Development Companies in Valhalla, Michael J. Bartolone, the chief operating officer, said the start of three new construction projects in Westchester -- in Hastings-on-Hudson, Ossining and Peekskill -- had been delayed because of the slow market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at two of the company's communities already under construction -- Christie Place, a luxury condominium project in Scarsdale for people 55 and over, and Riverwatch, a conversion of an apartment complex to condos -- sales, which had been slow in 2007, started to pick up in recent months, Mr. Bartolone said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than cutting prices, the company is offering buyer incentives. For example, if a buyer opts for $25,000 in extras, it will match that by providing another $25,000 in extras at no additional cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Bedford, Douglas Smolev, one of a group of developers building 17 homes priced at $4.25 million and up at Stone Manors on Twin Lakes, said he was aiming for what he called ''the recession-proof end of the market'' -- customers who were buying even if the rest of the market was not. But Mr. Smolev said that since the market started its slowdown, the developers were not building any of those homes on speculation.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., delivered a guardedly optimistic message to business leaders on Friday, saying that the economy was moving toward a rebound after months of malaise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are still working through housing and capital markets issues, and expect to be doing so for some time,'' he said in remarks at a conference sponsored by The Washington Post. ''We also expect to see a faster pace of economic growth before the end of the year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Playing an important role, he said, would be roughly $100 billion in stimulus payments to Americans over the next few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The fiscal stimulus will provide support to the economy as we weather the housing correction, capital markets turmoil, and higher energy and food prices,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another important factor, he added, was a less rambunctious Wall Street. ''The markets are considerably calmer now than they were in March,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paulson also stressed that risks remained, albeit weaker ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some bumps in the road'' are likely, especially in the housing sector, he said, but ''we are closer to the end of the market turmoil than the beginning.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hours before his remarks, analysts debated the importance of housing figures from April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction increased 8.2 percent last month, offering signs of life in a deeply troubled sector, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. But most of the gain came in multifamily housing, masking further bad news on single-family homes, whose groundbreakings dropped to a 17-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 million. Construction of multifamily units surged 36 percent, compared with a 35 percent drop in March, a huge swing -- and an average one in recent months, the agency said in a report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While building permits were up 4 percent in both areas, ground was broken on 1.7 percent fewer single-family homes in April, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 692,000 from 704,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were varied reactions to the new figures, with one analyst telling Reuters that ''it's a nice upside surprise'' and another telling Bloomberg News that the trends remained ''horrific.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael T. Darda, of MKM Partners, said, ''The bump in starts owes entirely to multifamily dwellings.'' While the single-family figure was bad news, he also said it indicated that the builders were ''rapidly taking supply off the market, which ultimately will lay the foundation for stabilization in the sector.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The month-to-month figures may have been mixed, but the year-to-year comparisons left no doubt that housing was far from a full recovery.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For My House?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Please, Don't Ask</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It can be so much fun to play the ''What's my home worth?'' game, either with your friends and family or inside your own head.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was especially fun a few years ago. If you were at a party in 2005, say, you might have been able to brag, ''And I could get three times what I paid for my house if I sold it now!'' (Never mind that you weren't planning to sell it, or that your next house would also cost three times as much.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, of course, fewer people can play this game with glee. Many people who bought houses last year have actually seen the value of their investment decline. According to Zillow, the real estate Web site, median home values in the first quarter of 2008 declined 7.7 percent from the same quarter a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the numbers also show that the value of homes bought in the first quarter of 2000 rose almost 68 percent by the first quarter of 2008 -- a possible argument for staying put, and a sign that people who bought homes last year may eventually have bragging rights at parties.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THERE was one last full-floor condominium lingering on the market in a meticulously restored and expensive prewar Park Avenue building at East 75th Street. So Elliott P. Joseph, the project's developer, jumped on what he thought was the perfect sales sweetener: two free Lexus hybrids with the purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon, however, Mr. Joseph sent a reporter a haiku-like text message reconsidering: ''2 car idea / Still an idea / Not a reality yet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After meeting with his broker, Kathy Sloane of Brown Harris Stevens, and her boss, Hall F. Willkie, Mr. Joseph agreed to trim the asking price instead of offering inducements to sell the 11th-floor apartment at 823 Park Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment has a 46-foot-wide living room and library (with mahogany paneling) facing Park Avenue, five bedrooms and nearly 4,200 square feet of space; the building has classical marble columns and a polished marble floor in the lobby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Joseph agreed to lower the price by $500,000, to $14.9 million from $15.4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the peak spring selling season unfolds, owners of other co-op and condos lingering on the market have also been trimming asking prices, hoping to get ever-more-cautious buyers to give their properties a second look.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last 30 days, prices were cut on about 17 percent of the co-ops and condos in Manhattan, according to an analysis of listings on Streeteasy.com, a Web site that compiles information from most brokerage firms. Prices rose on around 2 percent of all Streeteasy listings. Among the most expensive properties -- those listed for $10 million or more -- there were fewer price changes, but price cuts outnumbered price increases by a ratio of 10 to 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is one result of the cooler winds blowing through the Manhattan market, despite continuing high prices for completed co-op and condo transactions last month. Brokers say deals are being done, but they are showing apartments less often, and everyone is more cautious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am having fewer showings, but more of the buyers who look at apartments are serious buyers,'' said James Lansill, the senior managing director of the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the price cuts listed on Streeteasy.com was one at the Dakota, at Central Park West and 72nd Street, where the price of a 10-room apartment was reduced by $1 million, to $18.5 million from $19.5 million. ''As fabulous as your fantasy,'' notes the listing at Warburg Realty by Craig Schiller and Meredith Specht.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 1040 Fifth Avenue, the 17-story co-op designed by Rosario Candela at 86th Street, the asking price on an 11-room, five-bedroom apartment was cut by $3 million on May 5, to $21 million, four months after it was listed by Alina Pedroso of Brown Harris Stevens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Buyers are out there expecting to get good deals,'' said Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist at Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property. ''Some people who want to sell are more open to it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That isn't evident from actual sales data from deeds and tax records filed with the city's Finance Department. Preliminary data showed that prices rose last month, with the average sale price on a co-op or condo reaching $1.45 million, up 17 percent from a year earlier. The median price was $927,500, also up 17 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 823 Park Avenue, Mr. Joseph and his partners at the Property Markets Group thought they would be sold out by now, with total sales of about $166 million. They paid $60 million for the building, after the previous owner bought out the last of the rental tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, the 11th-floor apartment quickly went into contract, to a couple expecting a baby, but with construction delays, Mr. Joseph returned their deposit and raised the price to $15.4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the buyers in the building was Brendan Shanahan, the New York Rangers forward, who paid $13.4 million for the seventh floor.</p>

</div><div class="author">By FLOYD NORRIS   </div><div>576 words</div><div>3 May 2008</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THERE are a record number of vacant homes in America, the government reported this week, and the vacancies are concentrated in the newest part of America's housing stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Census Bureau reported that 2.9 percent of homes intended for owner occupancy were vacant at the end of the first quarter. That figure had begun to rise even during the housing boom, a little-noticed byproduct of the aggressive construction of homes encouraged by easy credit. Before 2006, that figure had never exceeded 2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses can be rented out, of course, even if they had been intended to be lived in by the owner, but the rental market also has high vacancies now. Over all, 10.1 percent of homes intended for rental are vacant. That rate is a little below the record level hit in 2004, but it is still higher than it ever was before the construction boom of this decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures include both single-family homes and apartments. In rentals, the vacancy rates are almost equal for homes and apartments. But in the owner market, the vacancies are much more concentrated in condominiums. In buildings with five to nine units -- like many garden apartment buildings -- the condominium vacancy rate is an unprecedented 15.2 percent. That is up from 12.2 percent at the end of 2007. Before 2006, that rate had never been as high as 10 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even worse news for those who bought new homes or apartments in recent years is that the vacancy rates in those properties are far higher than they are in older buildings. For homes and condominiums built after March 2000, the vacancy rate for homes intended for owner occupancy is 10.2 percent, up from 8.8 percent at the end of 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For rental units, the figures are even greater. There, 25.2 percent -- or one of every four -- of housing units built since the spring of 2000 are vacant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vacancy rates vary by market, of course. At the end of 2007, areas with the highest vacancy rates in housing intended for owner occupancy fell into two categories: Rust Belt areas like Detroit, Cleveland and Akron, Ohio, and former boom areas like Orlando and Tampa in Florida, and Las Vegas. Although home prices have fallen sharply in parts of California, only the Sacramento area shows high vacancy levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High vacancy rates put renewed pressure on prices, of course, and also serve as a warning that the home building industry may have a long wait before it can regain volume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction's share of the economy fell to 3.8 percent in the first quarter, down from a peak of 6.3 percent in the first quarter of 2006, when home prices were nearing their highs. But that figure is not far below the average figure for the 1990s, 4.1 percent, and well above the low of 3.3 percent, reached in the first quarter of 1991 after the last major housing market setback.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE prices are coming down, but new homes in the United States are still not selling, and some of them are getting old while waiting for a buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its report on new-home sales in March, the Census Bureau said that 189,000 completed new homes were on the market and unsold. That number was down a bit from the peak of 198,000 reached this winter, but it remains far higher than in previous cycles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It appears that many of the homes now being sold -- and there were 51,000 sold in the month, the lowest for any March since 1991 -- are coming from the supply of homes that are still being built or are newly completed. The median age of completed new homes on the market has risen to 7.4 months. Only four months ago, that figure was six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the completed homes are not selling, builders are unlikely to break ground on many new homes. ''It says that as low as housing starts have gone, you can continue to see them fall,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG. In March, the number of starts of single-family houses fell to an annual rate of 680,000, a 17-year low but still well above the rate of new-home sales, which came in at 526,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some areas, the risk is that some of the new homes will not sell at all. There are subdivisions with large numbers of empty homes, some that never sold and some that were sold to buyers who were unable or unwilling to meet the payments and left, sometimes before and sometimes after foreclosure proceedings began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other areas, the houses will eventually sell, but prices may have to be cut further. The median price of new homes sold in March was $227,600, a price that is lower than it was three years earlier. Prices in the first quarter of the year were down about 8 percent from the period in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such comparisons are risky, since the data include homes of different sizes in different markets. It appears that expensive homes are among the hardest to sell these days, a fact that would reduce the median price even if home prices were not being cut. While the rate of sales for all new homes, using three-month moving averages, is down by about a third from a year ago, the sales pace for homes costing more than $500,000 is down by more than half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, there are fewer new homes for sale now than there were a year or two ago, simply because there are fewer homes being built. But that fact offers little solace for home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In normal times, the vast majority of new homes being offered for sale have not been completed, and deposits are put down well before houses are finished. But in March, builders were offering 189,000 houses that had been completed, nearly as many as the 201,000 unsold homes that were under construction. Those two figures have never been so close since the government began collecting that data in 1970.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the figures for existing homes on sale -- some of them with owners who may decide not to sell -- new homes on the market that have been completed are certainly available, and the financing costs facing the builder are growing with every week that passes while the homes sit unoccupied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spring months of March through May are traditionally the strongest months of the year for sales of new homes, with the summer months almost as good. If sales do not pick up soon, the pressure to cut prices more may grow intense as the weather grows warmer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald R. Diamond, a wealthy Arizona real estate developer, was racing to snap up a stretch of virgin California coast freed by the closing of an Army base a decade ago when he turned to an old friend, Senator John McCain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Diamond wanted to buy land at the base, Fort Ord, Mr. McCain assigned an aide who set up a meeting at the Pentagon and later stepped in again to help speed up the sale, according to people involved and a deposition Mr. Diamond gave for a related lawsuit. When he appealed to a nearby city for the right to develop other property at the former base, Mr. Diamond submitted Mr. McCain's endorsement as ''a close personal friend.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Writing to officials in the city, Seaside, Calif., the senator said, ''You will find him as honorable and committed as I have.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Courting local officials and potential partners, Mr. Diamond's team promised that he could ''help get through some of the red tape in dealing with the Department of the Army'' because Mr. Diamond ''has been very active with Senator McCain,'' a partner said in a deposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. McCain, the Arizona Republican who has staked two presidential campaigns on pledges to avoid even the appearance of dispensing an official favor for a donor, Mr. Diamond is the kind of friend who can pose a test.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A longtime political patron, Mr. Diamond is one of the elite fund-raisers Mr. McCain's current presidential campaign calls Innovators, having raised more than $250,000 so far. At home, Mr. Diamond is sometimes referred to as ''The Donald,'' Arizona's answer to Donald Trump -- an outsized personality who invites public officials aboard his flotilla of yachts (the Ace, King, Jack and Queen of Diamonds), specializes in deals with the government, and unabashedly solicits support for his business interestsfrom the recipients of his campaign contributions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McCain has occasionally rebuffed Mr. Diamond's entreaties as inappropriate, but he has also taken steps that benefited his friend's real estate empire. Their 26-year relationship illuminates how Mr. McCain weighs requests from a benefactor against his vows, adopted after a brush with scandal two decades ago, not to intercede with government authorities on behalf of a donor or take other official action that serves no clear public interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, the McCain aide's assistance with the Army helped Mr. Diamond complete a purchase in 1999 that he soon turned over for a $20 million profit. And Mr. McCain's letter of recommendation reinforced Mr. Diamond's selling point about his McCain connections as he pursued -- and won in 2005 -- a potentially much more lucrative deal to develop a resort hotel and luxury housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Arizona, Mr. McCain has helped Mr. Diamond with matters as small as forwarding a complaint in a regulatory skirmish over the endangered pygmy owl, and as large as introducing legislation remapping public lands. In 1991 and 1994, Mr. McCain sponsored two laws sought by Mr. Diamond that resulted in providing him millions of dollars and thousands of acres in exchange for adding some of his properties to national parks. The Arizona senator co-sponsored a third similar bill now before the Senate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for Mr. McCain, Jill Hazelbaker, said the senator, now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, ''had done nothing for Mr. Diamond that he would not do for any other Arizona citizen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign said in a statement that the Arizona land exchanges had broad support from local governments and environmentalists seeking to expand a federal park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the California projects, the campaign said the McCain aide arranged the introduction to an Army official for Mr. Diamond's team as ''a constituent matter.'' The campaign said it had no knowledge of the aide helping to expedite the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Mr. Diamond's other project at Fort Ord, the campaign initially said that the senator ''would not have issued'' the letter vouching for Mr. Diamond ''if he knew at the time it would be used to favor any particular party in the course of a pending competition.'' Later, the campaign described the letter as ''a character reference'' and said it was included only at a ''pre-competition'' stage in the selection process. The campaign also noted that two other members of the Arizona Congressional delegation provided similar letters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Diamond, for his part, said Mr. McCain had only done his job. ''I think that is what Congress people are supposed to do for constituents,'' he said. ''When you have a big, significant businessman like myself, why wouldn't you want to help move things along? What else would they do? They waste so much time with legislation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he often complained to Mr. McCain that he was ''too straight'' about refusing to provide federal help for Arizona businessmen. ''I tell him, 'You are an Arizona senator besides being the world senator. Loosen up, kid!' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'A Love Fest'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Diamond, 80, met Mr. McCain when he was a former prisoner of war running for Congress in 1982. ''I liked him right away because I respected what he went through in Vietnam,'' Mr. Diamond recalled. When he got to know Mr. McCain and his wife, Cindy, Mr. Diamond said, ''it became a love fest.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Diamond was already a major player in Arizona real estate and Republican politics. A tenacious dealmaker who once visited a Mexican jail to close a sale with an inmate, Mr. Diamond had made a first fortune on Wall Street before turning his trader's eye to the Arizona desert in 1965. He eventually became one of the state's biggest landowners, picking up trophies that included the 12,000-acre Howard Hughes estate, stakes in two of Arizona's professional sports teams, the Diamondbacks and the Suns, and, for a time, a Tucson television station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, Mr. Diamond and his wife, Joan, visited the McCains at their ranch in Sedona, Ariz., and entertained them in their Tucson home and in the Bahamas, where Mr. Diamond sometimes keeps his 134-foot yacht, the Queen of Diamonds. In 2001, the two men attended a Yankees-Diamondback World Series game together. ''He is just very, very good company,'' Mr. Diamond said of Mr. McCain. ''I knew all his people and the staff.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Diamond and his family have given more than $55,000 to Mr. McCain's campaigns (and more than $600,000 to other federal candidates). More significantly, the developer has collected (or ''bundled'') hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions from others, and is now serving as a national co-chairman of the finance committee for Mr. McCain's current presidential run. In the spring of 2000, when Mr. Diamond was in the thick of the negotiations for his California deals, he traveled with Mr. McCain through the early Republican primaries. Mr. Diamond was on the campaign trail again this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In building his empire, Mr. Diamond said he had struggled with local elected officials over land use and zoning issues just like any other developer. ''They are a pain in the 'you-know-what,' '' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But associates say he revels in his ability to ''work the system,'' as his friend and sometimes partner, Stanley Abrams, put it: ''Nobody is as connected as Donald.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Diamond is close to most of Arizona's Congressional delegation and is candid about his expectations as a fund-raiser. ''I want my money back, for Christ's sake. Do you know how many cocktail parties I have to go to?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To raise money for Mr. McCain, Mr. Diamond invites local Republicans to make fund-raising calls from his Tucson office. Ray Carroll, a member of the council that controls zoning in Pima County, Ariz., said Mr. Diamond followed up on one fund-raising session with a thank-you note ''on behalf of Mr. McCain,'' sending a copy to the senator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To reciprocate, if you need any zoning in the county, let me know,'' Mr. Diamond wrote. (Mr. Diamond said it was the kind of joke he often made.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McCain has campaigned as a critic of the corrupting influence of money and politics, saying he had learned a lesson from a late 1980s scandal over his part in an intervention with banking regulators examining a savings and loan controlled by a patron, Charles Keating. Since then, Mr. McCain vowed to embrace ethics standards that set him apart from many colleagues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have carefully avoided situations that might even tangentially be construed as a less than proper use of my office,'' he wrote in his memoir, ''Worth the Fighting For'' (Random House, 2002).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McCain once publicly criticized Mr. Diamond as lobbying too hard for his own financial interests. In 1995, Mr. McCain called it ''unheard of'' that Mr. Diamond had hired a Washington lobbyist to try to block construction of a federal building in Tucson that threatened to take away some of his rental income. ''I didn't talk to him for one year,'' Mr. Diamond said of Mr. McCain. ''I was annoyed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legislating Land Deals</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McCain has been willing, though, to help sponsor bills authorizing federal land exchanges that Mr. Diamond sought. Former Representative Jim Kolbe, another Arizona Republican close to Mr. Diamond, said Mr. Diamond often proposed such deals and impressed lawmakers with his frankness about the potential sensitivities, Mr. Kolbe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He would tell you, 'I don't think you should get on this one, this one is too close to where you live, let another member of the delegation work on this one,' '' Mr. Kolbe said. ''He never tried to flim-flam you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such exchanges can serve a public interest by expanding parks or wilderness areas. But many environmentalists and other analysts have also concluded that such trades almost invariably give private developers a profitable bargain at public expense. Although federal rules stipulate that public land can be traded for private land only of ''equal value,'' appraisals of unusual property or in fast-growing areas are highly variable and developers often apply political pressure to get favorable terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study in 2000 by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office cited ''inherent difficulties'' and ''fundamental inefficiencies'' in such exchanges and urged Congress to discontinue them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first two swaps involving Mr. Diamond that Mr. McCain helped sponsor were initially supported by local governments and conservationists, and Mr. Diamond argues the land would be worth far more today. But many Arizona conservationists later protested that the federal deals gave away too much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Don Diamond has done very well through these land exchanges,'' said Sandy Bahr, director of the Arizona chapter of the Sierra Club. ''It is the public that got shortchanged.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The McCain campaign noted that the bills left the terms of any acquisitions to the Interior Department, but environmentalists argued that the legislation set the parameters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not like there is some market mechanism at work,'' Ms. Bahr said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The laws expanded what is now the Saguaro National Park just outside Tucson to insulate it from proposed Diamond projects, including one to build 10,000 houses and four resorts on the 4,400-acre Rocking K Ranch nearby. Mr. Diamond had bought the ranch for less than $10 million in 1979.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first deal, Mr. McCain was the sole Senate sponsor of a 1991 law authorizing the Department of the Interior to acquire about 2,000 acres of the ranch, which local environmentalists valued at about $5 million but Mr. Diamond and parks appraisers put at around $30 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next five years, the government paid him more than $23 million for the land and traded him two parcels of about 50 acres in upscale Scottsdale, Ariz. And the expanded Saguaro also added to the value of the remaining Rocking K land, where Mr. Diamond is still planning to build 3,000 houses along with resorts and golf courses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When The Arizona Republic linked Mr. McCain's support for the bill to Mr. Diamond's fund-raising, Mr. McCain called the implication ''outrageous and disgusting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1994, Mr. McCain sponsored, along with a Senate colleague at the time, Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona, another law expanding the park by again acquiring land from Mr. Diamond. To carry out the expansion, the Interior Department has so far taken over about 630 acres from Mr. Diamond in exchange for about 4,300 acres near Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Mr. McCain co-sponsored another bill with Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, that would grant Mr. Diamond about 1,250 acres south of Tucson in exchange for requiring him to contribute about 2,500 acres to other conservation areas -- a scaled-back version of a 2003 proposal that collapsed under protests that it was too generous to Mr. Diamond. A Senate committee passed it to the floor this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Deal and a Lawsuit</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the mid-1990s, Mr. Diamond set his sights on Monterey County, Calif., where the Army was closing Fort Ord. It was a dream property -- hundreds of undeveloped acres and two golf courses in the ocean-misted hills overlooking Monterey Bay, one of California's great tourist destinations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tipped off by a fellow Tucson developer, Mr. Diamond had snapped up a housing complex there that had been built on land leased from the Army, giving him the inside track to buying the land when the base shut down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Army did so in 1994, Mr. Diamond asked Mr. McCain, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, for an introduction with an Army official who could work out a sale. Mr. McCain's legislative aide, Ann Sauer, arranged a meeting with Paul W. Johnson, a deputy assistant secretary, a Diamond executive involved in the deal said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the talks stalled over price and water supply, Ms. Sauer interceded with the Army, according to Mr. Diamond's deposition and others involved. ''She showed up and got the thing resolved,'' Mr. Diamond said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McCain's campaign aides said in a statement they did not believe Ms. Sauer's involvement went beyond setting up the Pentagon meeting. Ms. Sauer, who no longer works for Mr. McCain, said she could not recall details of her role. A spokesman for the Army declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Diamond finally bought the land for $250,000 in 1999. He obtained an unusual guarantee from the Army that provided a generous water allowance outside the standard allocation process -- a bonus that continues to rankle municipal officials on the dry Monterey Peninsula.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Those guys got a sweetheart deal,'' said Michael Keenan, whose family bought the housing complex from Mr. Diamond for nearly $30 million two years later. Mr. Diamond acknowledged turning a profit of $20 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before he completed his negotiations with the Army, Mr. Diamond had begun turning his attention to an even bigger prize: the two Fort Ord golf courses, which had been sold to the city of Seaside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Diamond and his partners imagined building high-end condominiums and a luxury hotel by the links, a project they described in an internal memorandum as a ''World Series, final game, out of the park, grand slam home run.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Seaside solicited submissions in 1998 from bidders competing to develop a world-class resort, Mr. Diamond sought to exploit his Washington connections. His package included the laudatory letters from Mr. McCain, Mr. Kyl and Mr. Kolbe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The folks that were there at the time were sort of, like, star struck: 'God, these people really know some high-up people,' '' said a former senior Seaside official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Diamond acknowledged that, as court papers show, he tried more than once to enlist Mr. McCain in assisting the city on other matters as the selection process continued. ''I don't mind trying,'' he said. For instance, in 2002, Mr. Diamond forwarded to Mr. McCain an article from The Monterey Herald about Seaside's problems in a water dispute. ''As per our conversation today,'' he wrote, ''I would appreciate it if you would follow up and drop a line to the city manager of Seaside.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added in a postscript, ''Sorry you can't make it to the Yankees series,''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel E. Keen, the former Seaside city manager, recalled: ''Diamond had a relationship with McCain. He was offering to help.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McCain rejected that request as ''inappropriate at that time'' because he was poised to regain the chairmanship of the Senate Commerce Committee, Mr. Diamond said in the deposition. ''John said that he would rather not get involved. He didn't think that it was right.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Diamond's courtship of Seaside almost unraveled the next year when a rival developer, Danny Bakewell Sr., a civil rights activist, filed a lawsuit charging that Mr. Diamond had conspired to rig the selection process. The company running the former Army golf courses, BSL Golf, was acting as the city's agent to pick a developer, and Mr. Bakewell's lawyers presented documents showing that Mr. Diamond offered to give BSL a stake in the resort in exchange for helping him win the project. Mr. Diamond and BSL denied any wrongdoing and settled the suit for an undisclosed sum in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Mr. McCain helped with the Fort Ord deals, Mr. Diamond said, he still thinks that Mr. McCain is too worried about avoiding any appearance of a favor. ''He doesn't bring home enough for the state,'' Mr. Diamond said. ''It is a sore subject between us.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OUR politicians are devising economic stimulus measures to encourage consumers to spend more. These measures will cost taxpayers $200 billion or more. This is not money well spent. The problem is not too little consumer spending; the problem is too few home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many argue that we don't need government intervention to bring the buyers back; we just need the market to work its magic through lower prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, not entirely. When it comes to housing, lower prices don't inevitably cause sales to rise. Why? Because lower housing prices create the expectation of still lower prices later, causing buyers to wait for a better deal. Left alone, a weak market therefore overshoots with prices too low and construction too little.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a hot market can also overshoot with prices too high and construction too great. The Federal Reserve should control a hot housing market by raising interest rates to limit excessive price appreciation and overbuilding. When the housing market heats up, as it did between 2002 and 2004, the last thing the Fed should offer is low interest rates. But that's what it did -- now it doesn't matter what the rates are; not even low levels can entice buyers when house prices are declining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only solution is for the federal government to offer a temporary 5 percent tax rebate -- up to $25,000 -- for first-time home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This rebate is ideal because it would go to middle-class families who thought they were priced out of the market forever and young couples who will benefit from getting a home sooner rather than later. It doesn't bail out speculators. But by creating demand for homes, this rebate cushions the fall for everyone and stimulates economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Timing is important. If the rebate is offered too early, it will delay the adjustment we need to make, and push the problem into the future. If it's offered too late, we risk creating another episode of overbuilding. The right time to do the stimulus is when the adjustments have been substantial but not quite complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on what I'm seeing, a stimulus should commence in the second half of this year and be offered for about 12 months, depending on how the housing market is responding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The really good news is that the cost for this program is minimal and would likely stimulate enough spending and growth to more than pay back the Treasury with higher revenues later.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DUBLIN -- The collapse of the housing bubble in the United States is mutating into a global phenomenon, with real estate prices swooning from the Irish countryside and the Spanish coast to Baltic seaports and even parts of northern India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This synchronized global slowdown, which has become increasingly stark in recent months, is hobbling economic growth worldwide, affecting not just homes but jobs as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ireland, Spain, Britain and elsewhere, housing markets that soared over the last decade are falling back to earth. Property analysts predict that some countries, like this one, will face an even more wrenching adjustment than that of the United States, including the possibility that the downturn could become a wholesale collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To some extent, the world's problems are a result of American contagion. As home financing and credit tightens in response to the crisis that began in the subprime mortgage market, analysts worry that other countries could suffer the mortgage defaults and foreclosures that have afflicted California, Florida and other states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing the reverberations of the American housing bust and credit squeeze, the International Monetary Fund last Wednesday cut its forecast for global economic growth this year and warned that the malaise could extend into 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The problems in the U.S. are being transmitted to Europe,'' said Michael Ball, professor of urban and property economics at the University of Reading in Britain, who studies housing prices. ''What's happening now is an awful lot more grief than we expected.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For countries like Ireland, where prices were even more inflated than in the United States, it has been a painful education, as homeowners learn the American vocabulary of misery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We know we're already in negative equity,'' said Emma Linnane, a 31-year-old university administrator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She bought a cozy, one-bedroom apartment in the Dublin suburbs with her fiancé, Paul Colgan, in May 2006, at the peak of the market. They paid $575,000 -- at least $100,000 more than it would fetch today. ''I sometimes get shivers thinking about it,'' Ms. Linnane said, ''but I'll let the reality hit me when I go to sell it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That reality is spreading. Once-sizzling housing markets in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states are cooling rapidly, as nervous Western Europeans stop buying investment properties in Warsaw, Tallinn, Estonia and other real estate Klondikes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further east, in India and southern China, prices are no longer surging. With stock markets down sharply after reaching heady levels, people do not have as much cash to buy property. Sales of apartments in Hong Kong, a normally hyperactive market, have slowed recently, with prices for mass-market flats starting to drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Delhi and other parts of northern India, prices have fallen 20 percent over the last year. Sanjay Dutt, an executive director in the Mumbai office of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the real estate firm, describes it as an erosion of confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the retrenchment seems to be following the basic law of gravity: what goes up must come down. With low interest rates helping to inflate housing bubbles in many countries, economists said the confluence of falling prices was predictable, if unsettling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not the first housing downturn to cross borders, but its reverberations have been amplified by the integration of financial markets. When faulty American mortgages end up on the books of European banks, the problems of the United States aggravate the world's problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider Britain, which had one of Europe's most robust housing markets, with less of an oversupply than in Ireland or Spain. Then last summer came the subprime crisis across the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within two months, mortgage approvals dropped 31 percent, compared with the previous year. And by March, average housing prices had fallen 2.5 percent, the largest monthly decline since 1992.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The boom in house prices was actually much bigger here than in the U.S.,'' said Kelvin Davidson, an economist at Capital Economics in London. ''If anything, people should be more worried than in the U.S.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Britain has one of the most developed home-financing industries, not far behind that of the United States. The amount of outstanding mortgage debt, as a share of total economic output, is higher there than in the United States, according to a study by the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The U.K. followed the U.S. into never-never land, pushing mortgages out the door, believing that prices would go up forever,'' said Allan Saunderson, the managing editor of Property Finance Europe, a newsletter for investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the problems in Britain pale next to those of Spain and Ireland. Residential investment accounts for 12 percent of the Irish economy and 9 percent of the Spanish economy, compared with 5 percent in Britain and 4 percent in the United States, according to the I.M.F.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The glut of housing has brought new construction to a standstill, driving up unemployment and dimming the prospects for two of Europe's stellar performers over the last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're waking up from the property dream and finding ourselves in a situation where prices are falling in Spain for the first time,'' said Fernando Encinar, a founder of Idealista.com, a real estate Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Spain, more than four million homes were built in the last decade, more than in Germany, Britain and France combined. Average house prices tripled in parts of the country, as Spain's torrid economy attracted immigrants and Northern Europeans snapped up holiday homes along the Costa del Sol.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, though, thousands of those houses stand empty. The I.M.F. estimates that property is overvalued by more than 15 percent. With mortgages drying up and prices swooning, speculators who once viewed Spanish property as a no-lose proposition are confronting hard reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, Julian Felipe Fernandez bought three small apartments, as an investment, in a huge development being built outside Madrid. He paid 100,000 euros as a deposit for the units, and now he is eager to sell them to avoid having to taking on a costly mortgage. But with the market stalled, Mr. Fernandez's asking price is what he paid for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Three years ago, it looked like I would be able to flip them for a nice profit before they were finished,'' he said. ''I just want to get them off my hands, to get rid of this headache.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If he unloads them, he will be lucky. Enric Bueno, head of marketing for Ibusa, a real estate company in Barcelona, said his firm was closing six or seven sales a month, compared with 40 a month a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Things are really bad,'' Mr. Bueno said. ''If this goes on for five years, we won't make it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have been busy cutting their growth forecasts for Spain, with a few saying that it may stagnate this summer. BBVA, a leading Spanish bank, forecasts that unemployment will rise to an average of 11 percent this year, from 8.6 percent in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such cutbacks are well under way in Ireland, where the taxi drivers complain that their ranks are being swollen by laid-off home builders. The housing collapse has brought an abrupt end to more than a decade of pell-mell growth that earned Ireland the nickname ''the Celtic tiger.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the mood in this country feels like a wake, and not an Irish one. Average house prices fell 7 percent last year, the most in Europe, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, a British real estate group. They are likely to fall by a similar amount this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a 16-year boom that was interrupted only briefly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Ireland has the most overvalued housing market among developed countries, according to the I.M.F. In its recent economic outlook, the fund calculated that prices are 30 percent higher than they should be, given Ireland's economic fundamentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many Irish, accepting that reality is like passing through the seven stages of grief. Some homeowners are still in denial, brokers said, asking $5 million for houses worth no more than $4 million. But developers have begun cutting prices for smaller apartments like the one owned by Emma Linnane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Last year was our 'wake up in the middle of the night with sweat pouring down your face' period,'' said David Bewley, a director at the Lisney real estate agency. ''Now we've grown up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all the omens are negative. Mr. Bewley said houses were selling again, albeit for 25 percent less. Ireland has not yet suffered widespread incidences of defaulting mortgages or foreclosures in this downturn, in part because lenders have not been as aggressive as those in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some worry that the housing meltdown could spoil Ireland's recipe for success. Like Spain, it attracted lots of foreign workers, many of whom came for well-paying jobs in the construction industry. That fueled the Irish rental market, which has remained buoyant and been a source of income for Ireland's many real estate speculators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If the immigrants go back home, will this hurt the rental market?'' asked Ronan O'Driscoll, a director in the Dublin office of Savills, a real estate firm. ''If that happens, it would definitely cause foreclosures.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REPORTS of a decline of the Manhattan real estate market may have been premature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the release of first-quarter sales results on April Fool's Day, brokers have been ruminating on the extent of a slowdown in the property market. One report prepared for Prudential Douglas Elliman by Jonathan J. Miller, an appraiser, showed a 34 percent drop in quarterly sales, compared with the corresponding period in 2007, the steepest decline in sales in memory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This finding, however, was called into question by higher sales figures recorded by other brokerage firms. And even one of Elliman's top-selling brokers, Dolly Lenz, said in an e-mail message to fellow brokers, ''Something is very wrong somewhere and I need a plausible response, as will we all.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a later e-mail message to a reporter, she said that despite some stress ''here and there due to overbuilding,'' the ''market is really quite good over all.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Wednesday, Gregory Heym, the chief economist for Halstead Property and Brown Harris Stevens, sent an e-mail message of his own to brokers at those firms. He said that while each company's sales figures were only estimates, the Douglas Elliman report was incorrect and ''missing almost 600 sales, which were available for anyone to view'' in the city's online records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel Inc., said he used the same methodology that he has been using for 14 years, based on a variety of public and proprietary sources, and that differences in firms' reports could be caused by the timing of data collection. ''I stand by my numbers and the methodology used to compile them,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because there is often a lag of several weeks in reports of property closings, each firm tries to capture closings filed in public records up to a few days before the end of the quarter, as well as additional reports of closings from managing agents and other sources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a review of closing documents filed by last Wednesday, nine days after the end of the quarter, showed that the number of sales was roughly flat compared with the same quarter a year ago. They fell, but by less than 1 percent, or a decline of 11 sales out of nearly 3,500 sales reported in April 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last spring, the number of closings rose to record levels, but with contract signings lagging lately and uncertainty on Wall Street, few brokers are predicting a similar surge this spring. Yet who would have thought that Manhattan apartment prices would hit record highs in the first quarter, while prices fell across the country?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE real estate markets of the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island are suffering from the housing downturn that has afflicted much of the country, and yet they still have some pockets of strength.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In parts of Brooklyn, buyers are still paying top dollar for coveted brownstones, and in some neighborhoods in Queens, the market is buoyed by immigrant buyers who won't let a housing slowdown blindside their dreams of homeownership. And yet in the Bronx, foreclosures are rising in poorer neighborhoods. In Staten Island, prices are flat and foreclosures are up. At the top and bottom of the market, houses are still selling.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The markets in these four boroughs are more varied than those in Manhattan and the suburbs. Manhattan co-ops and condominiums are still getting record prices; the average sales price in the first quarter reached a record $1.7 million, although activity seems to be slowing. Suburban home prices are declining.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures released by  <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Schiller showed that prices for single-family homes in the New York City area dropped by 5.8 percent from January 2007 to January 2008.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first glance, much of the market in the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island looks as sluggish as in the suburbs, according to data from several sources. PropertyShark.com says that the median sales price fell by 27 percent in Queens from February 2007 to February 2008, by 6 percent on Staten Island and Brooklyn, and by 2 percent in the Bronx.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are serious signs of a slowdown. Fewer people are buying: sales volume in Queens dropped by 25 percent from February 2007 to February 2008, 31 percent in Brooklyn, 36 percent on Staten Island and 50 percent in the Bronx.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are foreclosures. In the four boroughs, 895 homes were lost to foreclosure in the first quarter of this year, compared with 529 in the first quarter of 2007.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But based on interviews with more than two dozen real estate brokers, the weaker sales figures don't tell the entire story, because prices vary by neighborhood and within neighborhoods.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the question is: How do you define a slowdown? Some Staten Island brokers see a rising number of foreclosures, while their counterparts in Brooklyn see fewer bidding wars on co-ops in Fort Greene. In both cases, this represents a changing, and slower, market, but it also represents very different realities.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brokers all agreed that real estate prices and sales volume aren't what they used to be. ''It's taking longer to sell anything,'' said Bill Shepherd, a 15-year broker with Brown Harris Stevens who hasn't closed on a house in Prospect Lefferts Gardens in Brooklyn since October. ''What might have taken a month to three months, it can take three to six months.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooklyn   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Brooklyn, prices have been holding relatively steady and there has been only a small rise in foreclosures. The median price for a home sold in Brooklyn fell to $392,313 in February 2008 from $418,700 in February 2007, according to PropertyShark.com. These numbers reflect the high prices being paid for brownstones in neighborhoods like Park Slope and Brooklyn Heights. In other areas, like East New York, homeowners are facing foreclosure. In fact, foreclosures in Brooklyn rose to 140 in the first quarter this year, compared with 129 in the same period a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers find themselves trying to keep up with an increasingly confusing market. In February, Marty Ellman, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, closed on her first short sale, a $785,000 home in Prospect Heights. (A short sale occurs when the sales price is less than the amount owed on the mortgage.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in March, she mediated a bidding war among 15 buyers for a two-bedroom apartment in Fort Greene that got $50,000 more than the asking price. At this point, she sees more bidding wars than short sales. ''Properties are flying off the shelf,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the right price, buyers are also still buying in less affluent neighborhoods like East Williamsburg and Clinton Hill, said Highlyann Krasnow, executive vice president of the Developers Group, a real estate marketing company. Her company sold 20 of the 24 one-bedroom condos at 223 Maujer Street in East Williamsburg at prices that began at about $360,000. She said that before the housing slowdown, prices would have been $40,000 to $50,000 higher.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most of our buyers are still coming from Manhattan,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these buyers are doing more homework, and they want good deals.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They could learn from the experience of a broker who did a lot of research before buying her own place in Brooklyn.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, Ailene Quinlan, a 34-year-old broker with the Developers Group, signed a contract on a one-bedroom condo at 111 Steuben Street in Clinton Hill.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before she bought, she rented nearby, researched the frequency of G train service and made sure she liked the local cafes and supermarket. She knew the neighborhood well enough that she was ready and able to pounce on the lower ''presale'' price of $400,000, compared with the current price of about $435,000 She chose an apartment with a large terrace because she thought it would help its resale value.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is an opportunity I wouldn't have had if I had waited,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Brooklyn prices could fall further if Manhattan prices start to slip. Sam Haskel, the executive vice president of HMS Associates, an appraisal firm based in Brooklyn, said that the success of Brooklyn hinges on buyers who cannot afford to stay in Manhattan. He said Brooklyn prices would stay high if Wall Street executives and foreign buyers continued to drive up Manhattan prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As long as Manhattan is going to be strong, Brooklyn will survive,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some Williamsburg condo owners who bought as investors are already unhappy with their purchases and are renting or selling at a loss, according to David Maundrell, the president of Aptsandlofts.com, a Williamsburg brokerage. So far this year, his brokerage has helped three sellers who have been disappointed with what they could resell their condos for.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One woman who tried to sell her one-bedroom decided to rent it out, despite a shortfall of $350 a month, because she could not face a loss of principal. Another couple sold their two-bedroom at a loss of about 5 percent when they had to relocate. A third couple just sold a one-bedroom, bought a year ago, also at a loss of about 5 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They thought they could get a lot more than they can,'' Mr. Maundrell said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Queens   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Queens may be the most difficult market to explain, because prices can vary by neighborhood and even by block.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of all homes and apartments in Queens plummeted to $283,665 in February 2008, compared with $390,000 in February 2007, according to PropertyShark.com. Foreclosures jumped to 508 in the first quarter of this year, compared with 319 in the same quarter the year before.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers also say that there may be no rhyme or reason to prices in Queens, or even to what type of house will sell.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sal Crifasi, the owner of Crifasi Real Estate with offices in Ridgewood and Middle Village, Queens, and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, said that in Middle Village, semidetached houses at 76th Street and Juniper Boulevard have held their value, while row houses a block away dropped by 10 percent. One reason is supply -- there are fewer semidetached houses -- and people like semidetached houses because they have private driveways and more windows than in a row house.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Mr. Crifasi said, Polish immigrants are buying both detached and semidetached houses in the $600,000 to $800,000 price range for 5 to 7 percent less than they cost a year ago in parts of Middle Village, Ridgewood and Glendale. He says these buyers don't have trouble getting mortgages -- or don't need them at all -- because they save until they can put down 50 to 100 percent of the purchase price.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Mr. Crifasi, many of these buyers have relocated from Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Renters from Greenpoint are finding that they can't afford to buy in their neighborhood. Owners in Greenpoint are selling to buyers from Manhattan and upgrading to larger homes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're selling their homes for a lot higher in Greenpoint, cashing out and buying more living space,'' he said. ''They can afford more. If they could, they would have no mortgages.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate is also attracting investors leery of the stock market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Celia de Campos, who is from Brazil, wanted her college-age daughters, Barbara and Juliana, to have apartments near her and her husband in Astoria when they finish their schooling. Last April, with help from Adriano Hultmann, a broker for  <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, she bought a one-bedroom condo at CityView in Long Island City for $390,000. In March, she paid the same amount for a one-bedroom apartment at Astor I in Astoria.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is renting out the apartments until her daughters are ready for them -- even though she says she is losing $2,700 a month after mortgage costs and common charges.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said she believed that real estate was a smarter investment than the stock market in the long run, and she was confident in Long Island City and Astoria. ''Immigrants go for the basics,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although fixer-uppers in all segments of the market and in all four boroughs are not finding buyers the way they once did, those willing to renovate are finding good deals.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Steven Toledo and his partner, Pedro Julio Serrano, signed a contract on a one-bedroom co-op in Jackson Heights for $220,000. They negotiated the original asking price down from $240,000 after pointing out to the seller's agent, Jorge Mejia of the Argo Corporation, that the bathroom tiles needed to be replaced.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Toledo said they bought now because they didn't think the apartment's price would drop any further. The apartment they bought is a sponsor unit, and they had to put down only 10 percent, or $22,000. They also were able to get a mortgage at 6 percent interest.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Toledo pointed out that this is an established immigrant community, not a gentrified neighborhood that is dependent on Manhattan transplants for price appreciation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I see other neighborhoods around there,'' he said, ''I think this neighborhood has so much room to grow.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bronx   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Bronx, the picture is discouraging in some neighborhoods because sales activity has slowed. But then there are neighborhoods like Riverdale that attract Manhattan buyers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to PropertyShark.com, the median house and apartment price dropped slightly, to $195,000 in February 2008 from $198,500 in February 2007. The number of foreclosures in the first quarter of 2008 jumped to 73, compared with 47 during the same quarter last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Sasha Catus, a broker who specializes in the South Bronx, says the market is much worse than these numbers show.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He called his business ''a well that has dried up'' and said that for every four homes he sold a year ago in the South Bronx, he now sells one.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he said, sellers want high prices for their homes, even if that isn't realistic. ''I don't know any of them who are getting the price they want,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Ng, one of Mr. Catus's clients, took a three-family house in Melrose off the market when he couldn't find a buyer willing to pay his price. Mr. Ng, a 30-year-old investment research analyst who relocated to Florida from New York, tried for eight months to sell his house for $640,000, turning down offers for $600,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, he decided to rent it out again. ''We weren't getting the type of offers we originally had wanted,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other homeowners in the South Bronx say they don't have the ability to wait out a slow real estate market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Isaac Suero, 34, who drives a candy delivery truck throughout the Bronx, tried for eight months to sell a three-bedroom house near Crotona Park for $339,000. He got two offers that fell through: one buyer lost his job before the closing, and the second had a co-signer back out on the morning of the closing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By last month, Mr. Suero was ready to sell the house to another investor at $270,000, which is what he still owes on his mortgage. At the last minute, he received an offer from a couple for $295,000. They are scheduled to close on the house next month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While much of the Bronx is suffering, homes in Riverdale are still getting record prices. Jill Sloane, a Halstead Property broker, recently sold a co-op there for $1.8 million, a record price for a co-op in the area. She says the market is good because Riverdale appeals to buyers priced out of Manhattan.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm seeing the market still very strong up there because I think people are still willing to go a little bit north to get more,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Woodlawn, a neighborhood with lots of Irish residents, prices have slowed. Fred Levy, a Halstead agent, estimated that activity and prices were down about 10 percent since the beginning of the year, but he said he expected prices to rise in the coming months as more people come to the area in the wake of a slowing economy in Ireland.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Staten Island   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are flat in Staten Island, but some buyers have been finding bargains on foreclosures.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median prices are down by 6 percent, according to PropertyShark.com, to $390,583 in February 2008 from $415,000 in February 2007. In the first quarter of this year, foreclosures jumped to 174 from 34 the same time the year before.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alex Papirov, the owner of Homes-R-Us, a brokerage on the south shore of Staten Island, said that apartments priced below $400,000 were selling to first-time buyers who still want to get into the market, and that those priced above $1 million were also finding takers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the middle of the market is weak. Brokers agree that homes selling for $400,000 to $1 million are taking the longest to sell.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Wonica Sr., the owner of Wonica Realtors, estimates that prices in this range have dropped by about 5 percent in the last six months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His office has handled 75 homes in foreclosure so far this year on behalf of banks, compared with 10 for all of 2007. Much of his growing inventory is coming from owners selling before they have to face a short sale.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers see a risk in buying a house that needs lots of renovation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not going to move into a house that needs $60,000 in work,'' said one buyer, Nicholas Siclari. He and his wife, Michele, have looked at 40 houses on Staten Island, but Mr. Siclari, an electrician, thought they all needed too much structural work, especially the foreclosed houses that owners damaged before moving out.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like putting a coat of paint on the Titanic,'' Mr. Siclari said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But foreclosures are creating opportunities for some buyers. Karlo Barranca, a Wonica Realty client, and his girlfriend, Kristen Janowitz, are two of them.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are looking for a house in the $400,000-to-$450,000 range and have seen 30 so far. Some of these homes have been foreclosed on. Mr. Barranca, who works as a medical software engineer, said he was prepared to do the renovations that many of these houses need, so he was shopping for the best deal.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are a lot of houses out there,'' he said. ''You need to do your homework.''   </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Manhattan Apartment Prices Hit Record High Despite Slump</span>
</div><div class="author">By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY  </div><div>1145 words</div><div>2 April 2008</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most of the nation plods through a housing slowdown, Manhattan is experiencing its highest prices in history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of a Manhattan apartment in the first three months of this year was $1.7 million, up 33.5 percent from the same period last year, according to the real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel Inc., which processed the numbers for the brokerage firm Prudential Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the record prices do not tell the entire story of Manhattan's real estate. Although prices are rising, sales are slowing, and executives of the four largest brokerage firms in Manhattan said they see some trouble, though not disaster, ahead for Manhattan's real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The huge price increase reflects the sale of an unusually large number of very expensive apartments, which skewed the average. In this year's first quarter, 71 apartments sold for more than $10 million, compared with 17 apartments in that range for all of 2007. This year's first quarter also included the sale of dozens of apartments at the extremely high-priced 15 Central Park West and the Plaza Hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of brokerage firms released data about the first quarter that generally showed the same trends. All showed that the median price of an apartment grew. According to Miller Samuel, it was up to $917,000 from $840,000, suggesting high prices for many types of apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for studios rose by 22 percent, to $490,000 from $401,000; and the median price for one-bedroom apartments grew by 12 percent, to $750,000 from $669,000, according to <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, a real estate brokerage firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firms disagree, however, on the extent of the slowdown in sales in the first quarter. According to Prudential Douglas Elliman, the number of sales fell by 34 percent in the first quarter, to 2,282 apartments from 3,474 last year. Data analyzed by Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property showed a 1 percent drop in sales. Corcoran also said it saw a slight drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one disputes the fact, however, that inventory is rising, and after a wave of bad news in the financial world, a crucial underpinning of New York's economy, fewer buyers are signing contracts. ''We're starting to see a hesitancy in the marketplace,'' said Diane M. Ramirez, the president of Halstead. ''What I look at very carefully is the signed contracts, the deals that are coming to us right now. I'm starting to see a slowdown.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, wealthy Wall Street executives and foreign buyers have stayed in the market, paying record prices in a range of buildings. The high average price of Manhattan apartments reflects the popularity of luxury condos. The average price of a co-op rose to $1.3 million in the first quarter of this year from $996,000 last year, and the average price of a condo rose to $1.9 million from $1.3 million during the same period, according to Halstead. Corcoran and Prudential Douglas Elliman reported similar figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of a co-op with four or more bedrooms rose an average of 86 percent this past quarter, to $12.9 million from $6.9 million the year before, according to Halstead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rising prices are not just concentrated among Thurston Howell III types who want to live near Central Park. Apartments in less expensive areas like Inwood, Harlem and Hudson Heights also saw price increases, according to Halstead's data. The average price of a studio rose by 2 percent, one- and two- bedroom apartments by 9 percent and three-bedroom apartments by 57 percent, according to Halstead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory J. Heym, an economist who prepared the reports for Halstead and Brown Harris Stevens, said that in Harlem, prices rose in new condo projects like the one at 111 Central Park North. In Inwood and Hudson Heights, the prices of co-ops increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In Inwood and Hudson Heights, that just shows you it's a decent resale market,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contrary to the trend in Manhattan, in Brooklyn, overall prices have started to drop. Median and average sale prices dropped by 2 percent in the first quarter of this year, according to data tracked by <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group.</span> Median prices in Brooklyn dipped to $549,000 from $560,000, according to the data. Pamela Liebman, president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, said this pattern was typical of any slowdown. ''When buyers become more cautious, the first markets to feel it are those that have been considered to be emerging neighborhoods,'' Ms. Liebman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All five boroughs are also facing an escalating number of foreclosures. The number jumped by 65.7 percent, to 918 foreclosures in the first quarter of this year, compared with 554 during the same time last year, according to PropertyShark.com, a real estate data company based in Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers make up a small percentage of New York City's three million households, according to PropertyShark.com. The foreclosures are concentrated in Queens neighborhoods like Jamaica and Howard Beach, and Staten Island's Mid-Island and North Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers are not as optimistic, however, about the next few quarters in Manhattan. Sales in the first quarter were strong in part because nearly a third of the apartments that closed were for condos that buyers signed contracts for at least a year ago, according to data tracked by Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now buyers have more choices, with an inventory of 6,194 apartments compared with 5,923 at this time last year, according to Prudential Douglas Elliman. The brokerage firms reported that the number of buyers who went to contract in the first quarter was far lower compared with buyers last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens, said that in the first quarter, the number of contracts signed in Manhattan fell by 21 percent even though the average price rose by 3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Liebman said she had fielded calls from several <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> executives wanting to sell their apartments in the wake of the buyout of their firm. She said that a couple of <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> executives put their homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Wall Street's pain is definitely real,'' she said. ''We will see less transactions, but stable prices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the brokerage firms say prices may eventually decline, they do not expect Manhattan's real estate market to suffer as much as the rest of the nation's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think you're going to see the next quarter being the end of the world,'' said Dottie Herman, the president of Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''You're going to see a market that's a lot more conservative, and things are going to be on the market longer.'' </p>

</div><div class="author">By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM   </div><div>483 words</div><div>19 March 2008</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses paid more for gasoline, automobiles and most products last month, reinforcing fears that inflation is rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While prices for grain and gasoline have skyrocketed in recent months, the pressures had not appeared to seep into the broader economy. But the core measure of the Producer Price Index, which excludes volatile energy and food products, jumped 0.5 percent in February, the Labor Department said on Tuesday. It was the biggest gain since November 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, prices paid by producers rose 0.3 percent, slowing slightly from a 1 percent gain in January. Food prices fell 0.5 percent. But with stark rises in costs for prescription drugs, motor vehicles and capital equipment, inflation clearly remains a threat, even as the economy slows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report disappointed economists who had been cheered by a flat Consumer Price Index report last week. ''We believe the producer-price data probably is more indicative of reality given the strong advance in commodity prices and the sinking U.S. dollar,'' Michael T. Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners, a hedge fund and trading firm in Greenwich, Conn., wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, home construction fell again last month as builders scrambled to lower their inventories. Permits for new residential projects slumped 7.8 percent, to an annual rate of 978,000, seasonally adjusted, the slowest pace since the housing recession of the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in permits ''is a crystal clear indicator that demand for new housing is quite weak and can be expected to remain so, for the foreseeable future,'' Joseph Brusuelas, chief United States economist at IdeaGlobal, wrote in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Groundbreakings for new homes fell to a 1.06 million annual rate, though the Commerce Department revised its January estimate up to 1.07 million. Apartment and condominium construction rose but starts of single-family homes dipped again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers have become scarcer and the values of houses have dropped as the housing market suffers through its worst slump in a generation. Economists say many buyers are standing on the sidelines, waiting for prices to fall even further, delaying the market's recovery until the summer at the earliest. ''There are still signs that house construction has room to fall further in the months ahead,'' Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at <span class="companylink">PNC Bank</span>, wrote in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Groundbreakings fell the most in the Northeast, with a 27.7 percent decline in housing starts. They stayed flat in the Midwest and rose slightly in the South and the West.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT housing turmoil? Despite a rising inventory of unsold condominiums in Brooklyn, one of the largest new condominium projects in recent memory is about to go on sale at the Edge, two glass and concrete towers along the Williamsburg waterfront, about a half mile north of the Williamsburg Bridge.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project's success -- or failure -- in selling its 575 apartments in one 15-story and one 30-story tower of blue glass facing a new pier, a new park and the Manhattan skyline may be a good barometer of the state of the New York real estate market over the next year or more.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the one hand, the developers say they have come up with the right mix of apartments (most with balconies or terraces), views and amenities (pool, spa, fitness center, lounges) to capture the imagination of younger buyers who are gravitating toward the industrial heart of Williamsburg.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other, the developers postponed the start of a sales campaign they had originally penciled in for last September after problems surfaced in the subprime mortgage market and buyers suddenly became afraid to make a commitment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales at the Edge will begin in early April.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Obviously, in general, the housing market has been under pressure,'' said Jeffrey E. Levine, the principal of Douglaston Development, which is putting up the towers as part of a project that will eventually include 1,085 market-rate condominiums, 347 subsidized rental apartments, parking for 700 cars and a retail complex.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Levine said the Williamsburg waterfront and Long Island City, Queens, have captured the imagination of ''younger people -- Generation X, echo boomers, the children of the baby boom.'' Many are buying their first apartments and looking to parents to help with down payments, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Edge, the developers have come up with a mix of prices, about $950 per square foot, that average nearly 20 percent below the average price per square foot in Manhattan (though above average prices in Harlem and Washington Heights).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Levine and the brokers marketing the building, the Developers Group of Brooklyn, have learned some lessons from the experiences of the other large waterfront development next door, the  <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>' Northside Piers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales on that project began in early 2007, and 70 percent of the 180 apartments have been sold in its first 29-story glass tower, now under construction. But last year,  <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> cut prices on some apartments with limited views and some larger, more expensive apartments.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Edge has obviously learned from our experiences there, and so have we,'' said David Von Spreckelsen, a senior vice president who oversees the  <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>' New York office.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the second phase of Northside Piers would have more studios and one-bedrooms -- so far the sweet spot in the Williamsburg market -- and fewer two- and three-bedroom apartments. More apartments in the next phase will have river views, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say the rising inventories in Brooklyn have caused some sales to slow and some projects to cut prices, but other projects have continued to sell well. They attribute much of the glut to listings by less experienced developers of small buildings without river views. Still, prices remain far higher than they were in Manhattan four or five years ago, and many buyers feel priced out.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Edge, apartments were designed in a wide range of sizes and prices. Studios are $420,000 to $630,000, and one-bedrooms $650,000 to $885,000. The prices for two-bedrooms range from $670,000, for a particularly small unit, to $2.29 million. The most expensive three-bedroom apartment is listed at $2.83 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Von Spreckelsen said the competition at the Edge could actually help sales at Northside Piers, by creating a ''critical mass'' to convince buyers who wonder whether the new Williamsburg is there yet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first building at Northside Piers is due to open this spring, while the Edge is scheduled to open in mid-2009. ''In this type of market, people who come into their sales office are not going to buy the first thing they see,'' Mr. Von Spreckelsen said. ''They will come and take a look at us, too.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT image does the term ''lowballer'' conjure up for you? A smirking bottom feeder in a bad suit? A fast-talking investor working the phone?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How about a couple of young newlyweds who have saved their wedding cash to put toward their first home?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James and Valentina Sbarra fit the last description, and they are relieved to be able to call themselves successful lowballers. Any nervousness they felt in making a stingy offer -- lowballing is typically defined as offering less than 90 percent of an asking price -- fell away when they struck a deal on their two-bedroom raised ranch in Pawling, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We kind of took a gamble,'' said Mr. Sbarra, a bank manager in Mount Kisco, N.Y. ''But it worked out for us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout the New York City region, buyers of all stripes are feeling similarly empowered to bid low and dream big. The practice still fails more often than not, in that buyers are unlikely to get themselves a steal. But many sellers are swallowing hard and negotiating, because lowballing has become so common that for better or worse, it's part of the new norm in buying or selling a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sbarras gambled by offering $287,000 for their house, which was listed at a reasonable $329,000. In doing so, they risked angering the owner and ruining their prospects for negotiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's worth 320, 325, and I gave them my opinion,'' said Peter Bell, an owner of Balch Buyer's Realty in Mamaroneck, N.Y., an agency that represents only buyers. ''But they said, 'We don't want to go too high.' So I said, 'O.K., let me make the offer as strong as I can, and we'll hope for the best.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much to Mr. Bell's delight, the owner responded with a counteroffer of $315,000, and the parties went back and forth until settling on a price of $300,000, the amount the Sbarras had set as their cutoff. The couple moved in last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We would have been disappointed if it hadn't worked out,'' Mr. Sbarra said. ''But it was a situation where we felt buyers had the upper hand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many buyers are willing to go a lot further than the Sbarras did, apparently without concern about rankling owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like the Wild West out there right now,'' said Terry Sciubba, the owner and broker at the Sherlock Homes Realty Corporation in Glen Cove, N.Y., on Long Island. ''I do have customers where if a house is listed at $600,000, they'll put in an offer for $350,000. That really, really happens.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the suburbs north of New York City, that mind-set plays out right through the home inspection process, which has become ''a weapon for the buyers to further negotiate the contract,'' said Keith E. Schutzman, a real estate lawyer in Scarsdale. ''A $500 repair item is now a $5,000 repair item'' when it comes to asking the seller to lower the price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tami Rapaport, a sales associate in the Tenafly, N.J., office of Coldwell Banker Residential, finds the same thing happening in her area, Bergen County. ''People are coming in with offers even 20 percent under,'' she said. ''People have no shame.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, there is an aspect of lowballing that can seek to take advantage of other people's desperation or misfortune. Some lowball bids are plain outlandish, never mind insulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet in a difficult real estate market, advocates of the lowball approach say that, practiced respectfully, it can also serve as a necessary reality check on overpriced properties. If some agents are reluctant to push stubborn sellers to lower their prices out of fear of losing the listing, a few disappointingly low offers will communicate the market's message in the bluntest terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Bednar has been tracking New Jersey lowballers on his blog, New Jersey Real Estate Report (njrereport.com) since mid-2006. Inspired by his own frustrations as a buyer, Mr. Bednar said he wanted to test the conventional wisdom that lowballing ''was a waste of time -- that it was futile to even attempt it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, after obtaining a real estate license, which gives him access to multiple listing service data, he began periodically posting lists of sales with gaps of 10 percent or more between the original list price and the selling price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, the conventional wisdom held up -- only a tiny percentage of sales reflected accepted lowball offers. But as the market began to slide, the discounts deepened. His last ''Lowball!'' report, in January, used a 25 percent discount as the starting point, and he still turned up 55 sales in the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now a real estate agent himself, Mr. Bednar sees no shame in making a low offer on a property clearly priced well above the market. While even 5 percent below the asking price might be considered an unfair lowball on a reasonably priced home, on a property priced ''horribly high,'' he said, ''20 percent might be just scratching the surface.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers, of course, aren't typically so logical in their assessment of an unexpectedly low offer. Those who perceive a lowball as a slap in the face tend to treat the offending buyers -- and sometimes their agents -- accordingly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have one seller who doesn't want to talk to me because I brought him an offer $200,000 below the asking price'' of $1.4 million, said Attilio Adamo, the owner and broker at Prudential Adamo Realty, in Ridgefield, N.J. ''Some sellers get insulted and hold a grudge.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is particularly true in high-powered, high-value communities like Scarsdale, N.Y., and Greenwich, Conn., where location and status help prop up prices. Buyers making lowball offers in Greenwich are not getting what they want, because sellers refuse to take such offers seriously, said Max Wiesen, a sales associate with Coldwell Banker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clients of his recently made a cash offer of $4.6 million for a property listed in the mid-$5-million range. Although it was low, the offer was reasonable, Mr. Wiesen said, given that the house had some issues and no other house on the street had sold at the price these sellers were after. The owners' response was a counteroffer barely distinguishable from their asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These people in Greenwich are not in the position other people in America are in,'' Mr. Wiesen said. ''These are wealthy people who can sit on their houses, and they do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But elsewhere, many agents are counseling sellers to consider a lowball offer as a starting point. The gamble for sellers who stall a lowballer in hopes of a higher offer is that with buyers so cautious and credit so tight, the next offer could be a long time in coming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not to say that every lowball offer is worthy of acknowledgment. Low bidders have a better chance of making headway if the house they are after has been languishing on the market or needs a lot of updating, agents say. Even then, the low offer is better off accompanied by a logical explanation, possibly with documentation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Herman, president of Buyer's Representative in Greenwich, a buyers' agency serving Connecticut, likes to write a letter explaining the thinking behind an offer and presenting some comparable sales prices. ''The listing agent often can't be that direct with their client,'' he said. ''We can be more direct and still be polite.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bell, the Mamaroneck broker, takes a similar approach with lenders when he tries to negotiate on foreclosed properties. He was recently awaiting word from a bank about approval of his $143,000 offer on an unfinished lakeside house in Patterson, N.Y., with at least $200,000 in mortgage debt. Mr. Bell hopes to fix up the house for his daughter. If the deal goes through, he said, ''I have three or four of her girlfriends waiting for the same thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though deals can be found if a buyer has enough nerve and stamina to put up with repeated refusals, agents advise that lowballing is a bad idea when the buyer really, really wants the house. ''You take your chances when you do it,'' said Frank Ledermann, an associate broker in the Scarsdale office of Houlihan Lawrence. ''It's America -- you can bid whatever you want. But you may not get what you want.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You certainly won't get Carleen Lekelly's house in Basking Ridge, N.J. Since Ms. Lekelly put the four-bedroom colonial on the market for $885,000 last November, she has received a couple of offers in the low-$800,000 range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her response has been matter-of-fact: with new bathrooms and granite in the kitchen, her house doesn't deserve discounting, and more important, she isn't under any pressure to move. Ms. Lekelly politely suggests that lowballers look elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I truly believe there are certain towns that are going to keep their values,'' she said. ''There are people that think they can go in anywhere and just lowball -- I think it's kind of silly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTOS: Carleen Lekelly, above, has her colonial in Basking Ridge, N.J., listed for $885,000. She has gotten offers in the low $800,000s but tells such bidders to look elsewhere. Yet James and Valentina Sbarra, of Pawling, N.Y., met with success offering $300,000 for a house initially priced at $329,000.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WILL the cool winds of recession settle over the luxury Manhattan market, as some market analysts are expecting? So far, the available evidence does not support that hypothesis.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ask John Burger, a broker at Brown Harris Stevens, who put a 12-room duplex co-op at 775 Park Avenue at East 73rd Street on the market for $24 million in late February. There was a 19-foot gallery opening out to a 33-foot living room facing Park Avenue, in an Italian Renaissance building designed by Rosario Candela.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within 10 days, the four-bedroom co-op was in contract. Mr. Burger said the response was exceptionally strong, since apartments in that particular line in the building had not been available for at least 19 years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some of these Candela apartments are like paintings,'' he said. ''When a great painting comes on the market, the market will be there. The architectural masterpieces of New York are always well received.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preliminary sales records in February show median Manhattan prices and sales volume roughly comparable to prices in the second half of 2007. Average prices in February for all Manhattan apartments were up 37 percent and median prices up 23 percent from February 2007, in part from the sales of expensive new condominiums.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average co-op prices were up 14 percent, while median prices rose nearly 4.5 percent, compared with the same month in 2007. The number of co-op sales lagged below a year ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, the chief executive of Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm, said that the market was stable but that prices were unlikely to rise above the records set in 2007. If the economy continues to lag, he said, the situation may be more worrisome in 2009, as markets are based, in part, on momentum and psychology.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage foreclosure notices are going out so fast that in some states the number of new foreclosure proceedings each month is greater than the number of homes sold that month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The foreclosure problem appears to be greatest in the West, particularly in Nevada, where home prices soared in the housing boom and are now falling rapidly.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worries about foreclosures have led to a variety of legislative proposals in Washington and in state capitals, as well as to a voluntary plan organized by the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., that seeks to delay foreclosures while homeowners and lenders try to work out agreements. But so far, no consensus has emerged on legislation, and the volume of foreclosure notices continues to rise.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During January, it was reported this week by RealtyTrac, there were 153,745 initial foreclosure notices sent out in the United States. That dwarfed the 43,000 total sales of newly built single-family homes and amounted to nearly half the total sales figure, which includes sales of existing homes and condominiums.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the West, however, the picture was much worse. There the number of sales was barely higher than the number of foreclosure notices. It appears that in the most heavily affected states the sales totals lagged behind the number of foreclosure notices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the volume of foreclosures is especially high in some states. In California, RealtyTrac reports, nearly a quarter-million properties were subject to some legal action related to foreclosure in 2007. Not all those foreclosures were completed, of course, either because the process dragged into this year or because the homeowner managed to sell the house or come up with money to make the missed payments. But those foreclosure moves affected 1.9 percent of the living units in the state -- or 1 in 52 homes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California led the country in number of properties affected by foreclosure moves, but was only fourth in terms of the percentage of homes affected. Nevada led in that dubious category, with 3.4 percent -- or 1 in 30 -- of the housing units affected. It was followed by Michigan, which missed out on the housing boom but is playing a large role in the bust, and by Florida, which like Nevada experienced a wave of speculative building amid rapidly rising prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those foreclosures, of course, represent dislocation for the homeowners being forced out of their homes and losses for the lenders. But they also represent an alternative supply of homes for buyers, providing competition for other sellers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That can be particularly true because sales of homes that have been foreclosed, or are about to be foreclosed if they cannot be sold quickly, are made by sellers who are in no position to wait for better prices. Those sales can help to push prices lower for everyone.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For new-home builders, one result has been growing inventories of completed homes without buyers. The number of such houses across the country hit a record 197,000 in December, and slipped only to 195,000 in January, the Census Bureau reported this week. Moreover, the median age of such houses is up to 6.7 months, nearly twice the age of such houses when the housing market was peaking in the fall of 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The states with the lowest rates of foreclosures tend to be states that missed the boom in housing prices and now have reasonably good economies. In South Dakota, there were only 50 homes involved in foreclosures last year, a minuscule 0.007 percent of homes in the state. Vermont, Maine, West Virginia and North Dakota also turned in rates below 0.1 percent.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The backlog of unsold homes continued to pile up in January, a sign that home prices will continue to drop as would-be buyers hold out for better deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell for the sixth consecutive month, dropping 0.4 percent, to an annual rate of 4.89 million, the National Association of Realtors said on Monday. While the decline was less than forecast, the sales pace is the slowest since the survey began nearly a decade ago. The median home price dipped to $201,100, down 4.6 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales rate, it would take 10.3 months to sell off the inventory of unsold homes. ''That's enormous,'' said Joshua Shapiro, an economist at the research firm MFR. ''That's double the normal amount and well above where we were a year ago.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a research note, Mr. Shapiro said that inventories might actually be higher ''if all those wishing to sell their home actually had the house on the market instead of pulling it off in the face of weak demand and eroding prices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists see little relief in the months ahead, as a combination of tighter lending standards, the softening job market and elevated inventories keep buyers on the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Home sales have not hit bottom yet,'' Mr. Shapiro said. ''Prices haven't declined enough to stimulate enough demand for sales to turn up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak demand is likely to put more pressure on homeowners to lower their asking price, extending one of the worst slumps in the history of the housing industry. The median price of an American single-family home fell in 2007 for the first time in at least four decades, and sales of those homes dipped 13 percent last year, the biggest annual decline in a quarter-century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes actually ticked up in January, but the rise was offset by a plunge in sales of condominiums and apartments. Median prices fell in both categories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there were a few positive points in the report. Economists had predicted a steeper drop-off in sales, and purchasing figures were revised up for the last five months. The December sales estimate was raised to a 4.91 million annual rate. The Northeast had the steepest declines in January, with sales falling 3.6 percent, but in the Midwest sales rose by 3.4 percent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- Elizabeth and Ben Kilgore are back in the real estate market. All it took was a little-publicized section of the economic stimulus package President Bush signed into law last week that lowered the borrowing cost of buying a more expensive home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kilgores, who live in Tiburon, Calif., just north of San Francisco, are looking for a larger home in town for their growing family. Three years ago, when they bought their first home, they resigned themselves to buying a condominium because it meant taking out a mortgage they knew they could manage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This will push us into a price range that's now financially possible,'' said Ms. Kilgore, a real estate agent in Marin County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if the limit on loans backed by a government-backed housing finance entity like Fannie Mae is raised from $417,000 to the full $729,750 she has been hearing about, Ms. Kilgore said, ''we will be able to get a 30-year fixed mortgage for less than what we're paying now plus our homeowner's dues.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The temporary change in the loan limits is not about to revive the housing market on its own. But in some of the higher-priced regions of the country that have been hit hardest by the flagging real estate market, it could make a big difference. For if anything is going to breathe new life into the local housing economy in places like the San Francisco Bay Area, San Diego, Washington and Boston, it is home buyers emboldened by the prospect of larger loans at lower interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Billett, a mortgage broker in Seattle, where homes in the downtown area sell for a median price of around $400,000, said that he, like dozens of people he knows, is poised to refinance an existing jumbo loan at a lower interest rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As soon as the loan limits are implemented and lenders are accepting applications. I'll be the first in line,'' said Mr. Billett, whose company, Response Mortgage Services, has been receiving a steady stream of inquiries from clients in recent weeks. ''I'm going to save hundreds, and I mean hundreds, of dollars every month on my current jumbo loan, by switching to a conventional loan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, rates on jumbo loans, those for more than $417,000, were only slightly higher than rates on conforming loans at or below that limit. But now, with the interest rate on conforming loans at around 6 percent, sometimes less, jumbo loans are at least a percentage point higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The difference is as big as it's ever been,'' said Bart Welles, a mortgage broker in Larkspur, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a high-priced home, 1 percent can make a big difference. A monthly payment on a jumbo 30-year loan of $729,000 at 7 percent would be $4,850. Monthly payments on a conforming loan of the same amount, at 6 percent, would be $4,371, a $479 difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the credit squeeze deepens, lenders have been reluctant to underwrite jumbo mortgages. That leaves houses languishing on the market, further depressing an already distressed housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change in loan limits, which allows the federal housing agencies Fannie Mae and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> to purchase or guarantee the mortgages, is intended to encourage lenders to write more mortgages because they can easily sell them to the agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should also stimulate house buying and mortgage refinancing. As the thinking goes, once people start borrowing money, they will set back into motion the economic machine of brokers, agents and lenders that has been stalled for the past year and has helped stall the overall economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Of all the various strategies proposed to help the housing market,'' said Gus Faucher, director of macroeconomics at Moody'sEconomy.com, ''I think this one has the greatest potential, particularly for expensive housing markets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change in loan limits will go into effect sometime in early March and will last at least through the end of the year. In areas where median prices do not exceed $271,050, such as the entire state of Alabama, the basic loan limit will be $271,050.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In areas where the median sales price is higher, the limits will rise to 125 percent of the median price, not to exceed $729,750. (The rules defining which locations qualify and where the borders of the areas will be drawn to determine the appropriate median price are to be written by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-priced housing markets -- particularly much of coastal California, with some of the most expensive real estate in the nation -- would benefit the most. In a state like California, or in the Northeast and Northwest, where home prices far exceed the national median of about $206,000, jumbo loans are a significant portion of the mortgage market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Francisco, where the median home price is $777,000, 35 percent of all loans were nonconforming, according to First American CoreLogic, a data and analytics company in Santa Ana, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The anticipated stimulative impact is all the more important because prices are falling sharply. Prices have dropped 20.4 percent over the past year in Contra Costa County, east of San Francisco, and 13.1 percent in neighboring Alameda County, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> Information Systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, California is probably the state hardest hit by the housing slump. As inventories rose in most cities, the median price dropped 16.9 percent from May to December, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick.</span> (Prices are still high; the California Budget Project, a public policy advocacy group, estimated that a family would need an annual income of $196,878 to afford the median-priced home in San Francisco.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the state, homeowners stuck with high interest rates and potential homeowners who are still searching are watching the situation closely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The window in the new law is short. But Mr. Faucher, the economist, said that if problems in the market continued, particularly in expensive markets, he would not be surprised to see the higher loan limits extended. ''There's nothing set in stone,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, the strongest interest is expected to come from people refinancing existing loans. In Berkeley, Calif., where the median home is worth about $776,000, MPR Financial, a mortgage brokerage firm, has received dozens of calls from clients asking about the possibility of refinancing their existing loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Quite a few people who got their loans when the rates were higher have called in,'' said Paul Riccardi, the firm's president. ''We tell them we have their application, and we'll have it ready to go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other places where housing prices are high, there is a similar anticipatory buzz about a change in the conforming loan cap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Diego, real estate activity has dropped off noticeably in the past year. According to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>, the number of homes sold in San Diego in January dropped 34 percent from a year ago. A change in the conforming loan limit could give a much-needed boost to the market, said Jim Abbott, a real estate agent there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The availability of jumbo loans was so easy,'' Mr. Abbott said. ''Now they're not, and it's really exacerbated the problem. But I don't think anyone is counting on it until it actually happens.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Byrnes, a real estate agent in Palo Alto, Calif., where Zillow.com pegs the median home value at $1.4 million, said he had two clients who were first-time home buyers and were waiting for the new law to take effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're literally waiting on the sidelines to see what happens,'' he said. ''If they can get a better interest rate it will make their path so much easier.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, prices for some houses in certain California enclaves and other luxury locations remain so stratospherically high that a change in the conforming loan limit, no matter how drastic, would have little effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It won't make so much difference here,'' said Edna Sizlo, a real estate agent in Santa Barbara, Calif., where the adjacent suburb of Montecito has homes valued at a median $4.1 million, making them among the most expensive in the nation. ''There's nothing you can even live in for under $1 million.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KIRK HENCKELS, the bow-tie-wearing broker serving the rich and would-be rich on the Upper East Side, offered a sobering thought in his latest report on the luxury Manhattan market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is a remarkably precarious time to be writing an analysis of the Manhattan luxury real estate market, '' he wrote.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the one hand, 2007 was a year of record prices and they show no sign of abating in 2008; on the other, there were fears that recession, the mortgage mess and falling prices in the rest of the country would dampen the Manhattan market. Rarely, he said, has there been such a clear-cut division in the economy between ''that was then'' and ''this is now.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But brokers can rarely shake their optimism for long, and the report prepared by Mr. Henckels, the director of the private brokerage division at Stribling &amp; Associates, noted in glittering detail apartments and houses that sold for $20 million or more in 2007 and beyond. While there may be thoughts of a downturn, there is the reality of a shrinking inventory of trophy apartments, he said. ''There is a shortage of unaffordable housing,'' he said in an interview. ''The inexorable march of money goes on, at least for now.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Henckels found that so far this year, 13 co-ops worth $20 million or more had closed or were in contract, compared with only 11 completed sales in that price range for all of last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After excluding co-op conversions, he found only six prewar co-ops available for $20 million or more. The list includes the $70 million tower apartment atop the Pierre Hotel, at Fifth Avenue and 61st Street, on the market for more than two years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some would-be buyers have a bleaker view of the market. Daniel Alpert, the managing director of Westwood Capital, which specializes in real estate investment banking, sold his Manhattan co-op and hasn't bought anything since.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Alpert argues that the disparity between the cost to rent an apartment in Manhattan and the cost to buy and maintain one is too high and cannot continue forever. He worries that a tightening of mortgage standards and future job cuts on Wall Street will drive away buyers of $1 million to $3 million apartments and eventually cause prices to sag across the market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many recent buyers of the most expensive apartments have been bankers and hedge fund managers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Records filed last week show that Raymond C. Mikulich, until recently a managing director of  <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> and a head of its real estate private equity group, paid $17.9 million for a four-bedroom apartment earlier this month at 15 Central Park West.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, Ronald N. Beck, a managing director and portfolio manager at  <span class="companylink">Oaktree Capital Management</span>, a hedge fund, paid $19 million for a duplex penthouse with two 43-foot-wide terraces at the Beresford, at Central Park West and 81st Street.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among co-ops, condos and town houses that sold for $5 million or more last year, average prices rose, according to Mr. Henckels's report. For the $5 million co-ops alone, however, the total value sold -- $1.29 billion -- fell 6.5 percent from the year before. He ascribed the decline to a shortage of inventory.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Friday about cities in which real estate values are holding up misidentified the state of one city cited as an example. The city is Salem, Ore., not Salem, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Tue Feb 19 2008 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AUSTIN, Tex. -- The real estate market these days is a tale of two Americas, and one of them is not doing too badly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the America of big-city housing markets, especially on the coasts and in the struggling industrial Midwest, the huge run-up in values in recent years has given way to big drops in prices and sales volume. Millions of people owe more than their houses are worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the other America, specifically in small cities like Austin; Grand Forks, N.D.; Yakima, Wash.; and Salem, Mass., the available evidence suggests the real estate market is holding up. Prices there never boomed as crazily as they did in the big cities, and now, even though volume is down almost everywhere, prices in many of these towns are firm or rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider the experience of one Austin resident, Dan Clark. Forced by a job change to put his house here on the market, he wondered whether he would get anything like the $385,000 he paid for it a year ago. He was floored when the second potential buyer to look at the place snapped it up for $429,000. ''Manna from heaven,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people are aware that a handful of big-city markets, like Manhattan and San Francisco, have largely resisted the real estate slide. It is less widely known that the same thing is true in scores of smaller markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I would call them backcountry cities,'' said Robert J. Shiller, an economist at Yale University and an expert on real estate markets who predicted the bursting of both the housing and stock market bubbles of recent years. ''They are just going through normal growth, and they are out of the bubble picture.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In figures released on Thursday covering 150 metropolitan areas, the National Association of Realtors said that median home prices were falling in 77 markets -- but rising in 73.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate statistics must be interpreted with caution, especially when sales volumes are declining, as they are all over the country. But an analysis by The New York Times of three distinct data sets -- mortgage data from the government, sales figures from the Realtors' group and courthouse records from a company called <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> -- produced a list of 17 metropolitan areas where all three sources of information agree that prices were still rising as of late last year, the most recent figures available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For another 43 cities, two data sets, from the Realtors and the government, suggested that prices were still rising late in the year. <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> could provide no information on those cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How long the situation will last is anyone's guess. One possibility is that the smaller cities are just lagging behind the big ones in seeing prices fall. And if the economy weakens drastically, all bets are off. But for now, buyers in these towns seem to feel they are getting a lot of house for the money; sellers and brokers are realizing that they have, so far, dodged a bullet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I read about the national real estate market, I feel fortunate I am in Austin,'' said Shara Parker, a real estate agent who is happy she turned down a chance four years ago to relocate to Las Vegas, which was booming then and is sinking now. ''Our highs are not as high and our lows are not as low.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say small and medium cities, especially those where land availability is not a constraint on growth, have done better than the nation as a whole because they have followed more traditional economic patterns. New-home prices in most of these places still reflect, more or less, the cost of the labor and materials used to build the houses, in addition to a profit margin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are a lot of places where you didn't have flipping of real estate,'' said Steve Dennis, a business professor at the University of North Dakota. ''Since you didn't have the price appreciation, you don't have the price correction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally, the markets that are showing strength do not have the bulging housing inventories of larger cities, because there was relatively little speculative building during the early part of this decade. Most of the towns have only modest exposure to the subprime loan crisis. And falling mortgage rates are buoying these markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, their local economies are still producing new jobs and healthy income growth because of factors like rising crop prices (as in Bismarck, N.D.) or local oil booms (Midland, Tex.) or an influx of second-home buyers (Sun Valley, Idaho).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In 2008, I see momentum growing in Middle America for prices to stabilize and increase, given the historic mortgage rates,'' said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors. But he added, ''If we go into a recession, it's possible some markets will reverse themselves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Austin is a good example of a real estate market that was slow and steady for years and now appears to be taking off. Austin's high-tech industries are attracting well-heeled buyers from cities where real estate is far more expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales prices for existing homes barely moved from 2001 to 2005, when the markets in a handful of superstar cities were on fire. But last year, the median price for a single family home rose 6.4 percent, to $185,000. It was the second consecutive strong year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have to calm my buyer clients down,'' said Mark Minchew, an Austin Realtor, ''so they don't pay too much.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fly in the ointment for these cities is declining sales volumes, which prompt some experts to argue that median prices are presenting an unduly rosy picture. If fewer houses sell, but the ones that do sell are at the high end of the range, that can skew median prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the markets that are doing better, lots of people are not selling their houses, so you don't see the prices going down because they are not selling for a lower price,'' said Todd Sinai, a real estate professor at the University of Pennsylvania. ''The market is doing a lot worse than what the median prices would show.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, in many of the cities where prices are strongest, local Realtors contend that volume drop-offs have been modest, just a few percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Clark is one Austin home seller with a happy tale. When a recruiter called him late last year with an enticing executive health care job in Fort Worth, Mr. Clark thought twice about trying to sell a house he had bought only a year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was concerned after my relocation package ran out I would have to carry either two mortgages or a mortgage and apartment rent,'' he recalled. Instead he sold the house for a profit, and only $10,000 below his asking price. ''A weight was taken off our shoulders,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Colpitts, the editor of Housing Predictor, an online housing forecaster, says that the market is still slowing and that some smaller cities will be hit. He projects that only 60 of the 251 markets in the United States that he monitors will show price appreciation in 2008. ''The housing market is real sad, and getting sadder,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors in medium and small cities contend the median price figures may actually underestimate market sentiment, because the issuance of large mortgages has frozen up in recent weeks because of problems on Wall Street. In the view of these Realtors, it is the high-end sales that are stalled in smaller cities, skewing the median price data downward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Call me back next year, and we'll probably have a 3 percent to 5 percent price increase in 2008,'' said Rob Higgins, executive vice president for the Spokane Association of Realtors. The median price for a home sold in Spokane was up 2.6 percent in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Salem, Ore, ''everything is going up, even the lower-income homes,'' said Marlene Scully, executive vice president of the Salem Association of Realtors. Realtor data for the metro area that includes Salem showed a 3.6 percent increase for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Scully noted that of the houses that were listed in 2007, 97.6 percent sold for the listed price, ''which tells me there is a strong market because if there weren't, the sellers would have to negotiate down.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AVERAGE apartment sale prices in Manhattan soared last month to the highest levels ever, showing the tenacity and power of the luxury market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With at least 15 closings at the expensive new condominiums at 15 Central Park West, and a steady stream of sales at the most exclusive co-ops, including a record-setting $46 million sale on Fifth Avenue, the average apartment sold for nearly $1.75 million, according to a compilation of preliminary industry statistics.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was 21 percent above the average sale price reported in the last quarter of 2007 in a market study by Prudential Douglas Elliman.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the average sale price of a condo approached an astonishing $2 million in January, while co-ops, which had poked above $1.1 million in the last few quarters, hit $1.5 million, based on transactions filed by the middle of last week.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, despite the continuing euphoria in the luxury market, there were signs that the rest of the market was in a holding pattern. The number of closings in January rose sharply compared with a weak December, but remained below levels seen in both co-ops and condos for most of last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the median price -- the price at which half of all sales were above and half below -- was roughly flat in January, at about $857,000. That was slightly above the median reported last quarter and slightly below the level recorded during the summer. Median prices reflect the broader market without the influence of the mega-sales.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist at two brokerage firms, Halstead Property and Brown Harris Stevens, says the pace of sales at the upper reaches of the market was set by the availability of trophy apartments that rarely change hands, while buyers in the rest of the market are ''more sensitive to what is going on in the economy and with interest rates.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Many want to sit on the fence and wait,'' he said. ''Some people have the misconception that we have the same inventory here as in the rest of the country, and it is not even close.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big transactions last month included the $46 million sale of a co-op apartment at 1060 Fifth Avenue, at 87th Street, to Scott A. Bommer, a hedge fund manager. A $32 million duplex at 740 Park Avenue, near 71st Street, sold to D. Randall Winn, the managing director of  <span class="companylink">Capital IQ</span>, a division of  <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> that provides financial analysis tools, and his wife, Tamara Winn. She is a daughter of Ira Rennert, the billionaire investor who is sometimes credited with having the world's largest home, in the Hamptons.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of  <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, paid $26 million for a four-bedroom 6,130-square-foot duplex on the 16th and 17th floors at 15 Central Park West, with an 1,100-square-foot terrace and park views.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were also two sales at 1040 Fifth Avenue, at the corner of 85th Street. In mid-January, Mr. Bommer sold his 14th-floor apartment there for $21 million to Jeff T. Blau, the president of the Related Companies, which built the Time Warner Center.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two days later, Edgar Bronfman Jr., the chief executive of the  <span class="companylink">Warner Music Group</span>, and scion of the Bronfman liquor fortune, paid $19.5 million for a similar A-line apartment four floors down. That apartment is now back on the market with a $24 million asking price.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For homeowners in the metropolitan area, all of the talk in the past year about a real estate collapse may have sounded as foreign as a Bollywood musical.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, the value of the typical home in the area has more than doubled in this decade. And at the region's core, the prices of apartments in Manhattan have floated upward on seemingly unquenchable demand.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But lately, more cracks in the housing market have begun to show, and the trend is reminding some analysts of the severe downturn in the region during the recession that followed the boom years of the late 1980s.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in Manhattan, signs of weakness have appeared beneath the headlines about ever-rising average sale prices of condominiums and co-ops.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report last week found that rents in Manhattan declined in January, by more than 7 percent in some neighborhoods, according to the Real Estate Group New York.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest set of numbers ''reinforces our sentiment that the market has, in fact, turned,'' Daniel Baum, the chief operating officer of the company, said in the report.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic distress signals are not nearly as widespread as they were in the early 1990s, and economists are still debating whether there will even be a recession this time.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, the long advance and subsequent retreat in house prices in the region bear an eerie resemblance to the rise and fall of two decades ago. It is too soon to tell just how deep the current decline will be. But James W. Hughes, who has tracked the market for homes around New York City through cycles of boom and bust, said he expected it to be worse than -- maybe twice as bad as -- the fallout from the ''real estate bubble'' of the 1980s.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hughes, the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, said that housing prices in New Jersey rose 145 percent from 1980 to 1988, then fell about 9 percent by 1992.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pattern for the suburbs in New York and Connecticut was similar, he said. That flow and ebb left people who stayed in their houses during that period with property values that more than doubled, on average.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the people who bought near the peak in 1988 faced significant losses if they had to sell quickly. Indeed, it took 10 years for house prices in New Jersey to return to their 1988 level, Mr. Hughes said. (Taking inflation into account, the recovery was not complete until 2002, he said.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of the pain was felt by peak-of-market buyers that bought in '88,'' Mr. Hughes said. ''Those are the ones that really got stuck.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 1998 to 2006, the suburban housing market was sizzling again, with prices of homes in New Jersey rising 135 percent during that period, he said. According to the data that Mr. Hughes uses, prices in the region peaked in mid-2007.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures for Long Island show a similar pattern. In Nassau and Suffolk Counties, median home prices peaked in August and were lower by the end of the year than at the end of 2006, according to data compiled by the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with most of the country, New York City property values have held up better. During the 12 months ending in November, prices in the metropolitan area fell 4.8 percent, according to  <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices. But that was not as bad as the 7.8 percent drop in the Washington area and far better than the declines of more than 12 percent in Miami, San Diego, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Tampa, Fla.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property values in Sun Belt cities grew faster than those in New York in the latest run-up. That was a reversal of the pattern of the 1980s, when house prices in the New York area rose faster and higher than in the rest of the country, then sank faster and farther.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the region, the closer to Manhattan, the better the situation looks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes in suburbs within a one-hour commute have not lost value as fast as those in the outer suburbs, said Jeffrey Otteau, president of the Otteau Valuation Group in East Brunswick, N.J. And Mr. Otteau forecasted that the closer suburbs would suffer only half of the decline of the outer suburbs by the time the market hit bottom early next year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Up to this point, the state of the market is worse now in the outlying suburbs than it was in the '89-'92 correction,'' Mr. Otteau said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By his measure, those prices fell 15 percent during that recession and already are down almost 15 percent since they peaked in 2005, he said. In all, he predicted that prices in the outlying suburbs would decline by about 19 percent and would not reach their previous peak again until about 2014.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners who are waiting for the market to rebound to sell their houses will regret that decision, Mr. Otteau said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For those sellers who've decided to wait until spring to get what they think their house is worth, the spring they're waiting for is a very long time off,'' Mr. Otteau said. ''Unless you have the ability to wait this out for five years, waiting is a losing game.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hughes of Rutgers relies on a different set of numbers than Mr. Otteau cites, but both concluded that house prices in the region would drop by at least 15 percent in the current correction, despite the recent decline in interest rates.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the local job market has not been battered by widespread layoffs as it was in the early 1990s, Mr. Hughes said he believed the housing market would suffer more this time because of the reckless lending practices that allowed so many people to buy homes with little or no money down.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the excesses of the subprime lending and extraordinarily low interest rates, as well as all those other exotic loans, really helped inflate the bubble,'' Mr. Hughes said. ''The correction from that and the fallout from the credit meltdown globally probably portends a more severe correction.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in 20 metropolitan areas fell in November for the 11th consecutive month, as foreclosures and a slump in sales added to the glut of unsold properties.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices fell 7.7 percent from a year earlier after dropping 6.1 percent in October, according to the  <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home-price index released Tuesday. The decline is the biggest since the 20-city index was started in 2000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The housing market is going to continue to look quite dismal for some time as the imbalances are worked out,'' said Michelle Meyer, an economist at  <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> in New York.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expected the home-price index to drop 7.1 percent, according to the median of 14 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. Estimates of the decline ranged from 6 percent to 8 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with a month earlier, home prices fell 2.1 percent. The figures are not seasonally adjusted, so economists prefer to focus on the year-over-year change.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index is a composite of transactions in 20 metropolitan areas. Seventeen cities showed a drop in prices from a year earlier, led by a 15 percent decline in Miami. Three cities -- Charlotte, N.C.; Portland, Ore.; and Seattle -- showed increases. In New York, the index fell 4.8 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with a month earlier, all 20 cities in the survey showed a decline.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are in an historic housing bust right now,'' Robert J. Shiller, the chief economist at MacroMarkets and a professor at Yale, said in a television interview.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shiller and Karl E. Case, an economics professor at Wellesley, created the home-price index based on research from the 1980s.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group's 10-city composite index, which has a longer history, fell a record 8.4 percent in the 12 months that ended in November. The decline is ''probably'' the biggest since ''sometime around World War II,'' Mr. Shiller said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builder Files for Bankruptcy   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tousa Inc., the Florida-based home builder, said Tuesday that it had filed for bankruptcy protection, hit hard by a downturn in the housing market.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing industry, caught in a maelstrom of sinking demand, rising foreclosures and bulging inventories, is in its worst slump in decades, a growing body of economic evidence shows.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes fell last year by 26 percent, the steepest drop since records began in 1963, the Commerce Department said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of previously owned single-family homes, a large portion of the overall housing market, dropped the most on an annual basis in 25 years. And the median price of those homes fell for the first time in at least four decades.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists predict the market may start to recover in the summer. Others are less optimistic. ''There is no sign of a bottom in any of these data,'' wrote Ian C. Shepherdson, a London-based economist at High Frequency Economics. Last month alone, sales of new homes tumbled 4.7 percent, to a 604,000 annual rate, the smallest monthly sales figure since February 1995.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices also fell sharply. In December, the median price of a new home fell to $219,200, down 10.9 percent from December 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No matter which way you look at it, the December new-home sales report is simply awful,'' wrote Dimitry Fleming, an economist at ING Bank.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December capped a painful year for home builders, who watched demand dry up as buyers abandoned contracts or stayed on the sidelines with the expectation that prices would fall further. For the year, the median price of new homes rose just 0.2 percent, to $246,900.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A wave of foreclosures and tightened lending standards have made it more difficult to obtain a mortgage, even for buyers with good credit. And banks have been more reluctant to lend in light of the subprime mortgage crisis.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are trying to lure buyers by dropping prices and throwing in incentives like new appliances. They have also cut back on new construction.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the strategy has failed to make a dent in inventories: the backlog of new homes on the market ticked up last month to 9.6 months' supply based on the current sales rate, the Commerce Department said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes were down in December in most regions, with the steepest declines in the South and West. Midwest sales fell slightly, and there was a small uptick in the Northeast.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with December 2006, sales decreased 56 percent in the Midwest, 43 percent in the West, 36 percent in the South and 27 percent in the Northeast.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department also lowered its numbers for new-home sales in November, to a 634,000 annual pace. It originally estimated a rate of 647,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jobless Rate Flat in Japan   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO (Reuters) -- Japan's jobless rate was flat in December, the government said Tuesday, while overall household spending and retail sales rose modestly in December from a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unemployment rate was 3.8 percent in December, slightly less than the 3.9 percent expected. The jobless rate has crept up from a nine-year low of 3.6 percent in July, suggesting the market was stalling as small companies, which employ 7 out of 10 workers, have held back.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall household spending rose 2.2 percent percent in December from a year earlier, to the surprise of economists who had expected a 0.2 percent fall.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail sales rose 0.2 percent in December from a year earlier, slightly higher than a consensus forecast for a 0.1 percent rise.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of an American single-family home fell in 2007 for the first time in at least four decades, according to the National Association of Realtors, a trade group.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the first price decline in many, many years,'' the group's chief economist, Lawrence Yun, said Thursday. ''And possibly going back to the Great Depression.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a single-family home fell 1.8 percent, to $217,800, the first annual decline since reliable records began in 1968.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And even as prices plummeted, buyers vanished. Over all, sales of previously owned single-family homes dropped 13 percent in 2007, the biggest decline in a quarter-century. (The group's survey excludes newly constructed homes.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists now say the housing market, plagued by its worst downturn since the early 1990s, will not bottom out until at least the summer, and even then sales are expected to remain sluggish.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Housing activity remains weak,'' said Mickey Levy, chief economist at  <span class="companylink">Bank of America.</span> ''What more can be said?''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month alone, total sales dipped 2.2 percent from November, slowing to a 4.89 million annual rate. Condominium sales were off 25 percent from the year-ago period.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sellers are grappling with a combination of elevated inventories and tighter lending standards, which make it harder for potential buyers to take out a mortgage. Concerns over the health of the economy have not helped: a slowdown may make Americans more reluctant to undertake large purchases.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The weak demand is reflecting uncertainty about the economy, higher unemployment, and expectations prices are going to fall further,'' Mr. Levy said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the backlog of unsold homes ticked down slightly in December, at least one economist attributed the drop to discouraged homeowners ''pulling their homes off the market in the face of continued weak demand and falling prices.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We still have a long way to go before prices sink to levels necessary to balance supply and demand in the housing market,'' the economist, Joshua Shapiro of MFR, wrote in a research note.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Northeast suffered the steepest decline in sales last month, with purchases down 4.6 percent from November. Prices in the region have fallen 8.9 percent from December 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with December 2006, sales dropped 21 percent in the South, 25 percent in the West, 20 percent in the Midwest and 22 percent in the Northeast.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a single-family home in December was $206,500, down from $207,300 in November.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CONGRATULATIONS, Manhattan town house owners! Your houses are worth more than ever. And, by the way, the government has noticed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city just released its tentative assessment rolls for the next tax year, along with reams of information about property sales trends. Outside Manhattan, the city found that the market value of one-, two- and three-family homes fell last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But city tax files show that actual sales prices soared in Manhattan in 2007, though at a slower rate than in 2006, giving everyone a reason to celebrate so far -- including the tax collectors. Though the weakening economy makes the future outlook uncertain, brokers say that in past downturns, prices of town houses held up much longer than co-ops or condominiums.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City tax files, released, city officials say, to increase the ''transparency'' of the tax system, indicates that the average house price across Manhattan, from the prime neighborhoods on the Upper East Side to the rapidly gentrifying houses in Upper Manhattan, rose by more than 19 percent, to $5.15 million from $4.32 million the year before.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, the average sale price went up 30 percent, from $3.32 million the year before. The Upper East Side, with an average price of almost $10.1 million in its 54 sales, drove up the Manhattan averages, offset in part by 66 sales in Harlem with an average sale price of about $1.4 million. Harlem prices were up 20 percent from the year before (though the Harlem totals include a small house on Park Avenue and East 97th Street, just north of the traditional boundary with the Upper East Side, that sold for $3.3 million).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the West Side and in Greenwich Village, the average house went for about $6.2 million, according to the city data. Starter houses on the East and West Side began about $3.5 million, at or below the price of many larger new glass-walled condos. These figures do not include the sales of town houses with more than three apartments, which sometime sell for less, because they come complete with rent-regulated tenants.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even on the Upper East Side there was quite a range of town houses that buyers could choose from last year, varying by location, price and size. Last January, a town house at 177 East 70th Street, just off Third Avenue, sold for $3.55 million, making it the lowest-priced town house to sell on the Upper East Side last year. The three-story brownstone with a bay window on the second floor is in a historic district, but next door to a 20-story co-op. It is 12 and a half feet wide, with nearly 2,500 square feet of space, according to tax records.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The highest sale price on the Upper East Side was $50 million, for a 31-foot mansion sold by Edgar Bronfman Jr., an heir to the Seagram's liquor fortune and the chairman of the  <span class="companylink">Warner Music Group</span>, at 15 East 64th Street. It closed last October.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SPRING has already started for residential real estate, at least the way brokers look at it. And spring is coming in, well, not so much like a lion or a lamb as a lumbering bear.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of home sales has slowed markedly, according to the latest statewide market reports. And prices continue their descent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market analyst Jeffrey G. Otteau told brokers in his January report not to expect a return to boom times for a long time to come -- a really long time, according to his numbers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Home prices are unlikely to recover to 2005 levels until spring of 2014,'' Mr. Otteau stated flatly in the report, which is based on his company's monitoring of contract sales.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he points out -- and brokers tend to agree with this part, if not the more negative predictions -- that this means it is an excellent time to buy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Spring 2008 will present a unique opportunity that has never before occurred in the housing market, namely lower home prices and low mortgage interest rates,'' Mr. Otteau said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jacelyn Botti, president of  <span class="companylink">Weichert Realtors</span>, agreed, saying that an auspicious moment was brewing for buyers. ''We consider that our spring market starts the third week in January,'' Mrs. Botti said. ''That's when people start making their move. Starting from there, we are looking at an interest rate, for a 30-year fixed mortgage, of 5.75'' percent, which she said was ''the lowest since spring of '05.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've got a good inventory of homes, and prices have definitely become more reasonable,'' she added. ''It's all good.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For buyers, Mr. Otteau predicts, things will only get better as real spring arrives. The inventory -- which, typically, has shrunk as fewer people seek to sell during the cold-weather months -- will blossom again in the spring, he said. And the federal interest-rate regulators are already talking about another rate cut.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As far as selling is concerned, he pointed out that with average sales prices virtually certain to dip further, and to bounce back only very slowly and gradually, a person who wants or needs to sell might simply be ''unwise'' to tarry.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ken Baris of Jordan Baris Realtors elaborated on the point, saying: ''The spring is the busiest season for listings. Values decline further as buyers get more choices. They can make lower offers, and those offers start to be accepted.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lots of would-be sellers are still saying they don't want to put homes on the market that have recently gone down in value, because they could go up again, Mr. Baris noted.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reality, he asserted, is that ''prices are dropping everywhere except in Manhattan,'' and that ''anyone who tells you otherwise is simply trying to pretend the house they are selling is different, or else they haven't looked at the numbers.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He cited an example -- a house sold by his agency a week ago in North Caldwell. ''It was listed at $1.25 million, reduced to $1.15 million, then to $1 million, and sold to a buyer we represented for $900,000. That is typical.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he believed this chain of events was being played out across the range of home prices -- although he could cite exceptions in certain ''pocket markets.'' For instance, at a new development on the former Upsala College campus in East Orange, 45 of 51 single-family homes have sold in the last year, for $439,000 to $600,000 -- record-breaking prices for the community.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's patchy,'' agreed Linda Grotenstein, of Coldwell Banker in Essex County, ''and there's always a head shaker or two.'' Ms. Grotenstein pointed to a house on Midland Avenue in Montclair that went on the market for $659,000 on New Year's Eve, quickly garnered seven offers, and sold after nine days for $99,000 over the asking price.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elaine Pruzon, a Coldwell agent operating in the exclusive communities of Short Hills, Summit and Livingston, said she had listed a house at more than $3 million this month, and got two quick offers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I just don't feel the downturn touches these communities as much,'' she said. ''People still need or want to move from Manhattan to these very desirable places, which have quick commutes. Yes, there are bargain hunters, even in Short Hills and Summit, and some are successful right now, but many are not.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Botti, president of a seven-state Weichert region that includes New York and New Jersey, said her firm's sales of homes at the top end -- $2 million and above -- had been robust. There were 6 percent more sales in that category in 2007 than in 2006, she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think that makes a strong statement to the rest of the market that now is the time to buy,'' she added. ''People with financial wherewithal, who are well educated to market conditions, are not standing on the sidelines.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Baris says he can see only one situation in which the market doesn't favor a buyer: ''If you are selling now to buy a less expensive house, it's not good news,'' he said. ''You've lost more in value on your current house, proportionately, than you will gain from the price drop on a lesser house.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the flip side, he added, those sellers who want to ''trade up'' to a more expensive property will more than make up a decline in market value. ''A 20 percent discount on a more expensive house is going to be bigger,'' he said, ''so there is a net gain in value.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction fell again in December as builders scrambled to cut back in the face of rising inventories and fewer orders. The drop-off is likely to hurt businesses that serve the housing industry, which economists do not expect to bottom out until the middle of the year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Groundbreakings remained at the lowest level in more than 16 years, and permits for new residential construction projects recorded their slowest month since the housing recession of the early 1990s, the Commerce Department said on Thursday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 14 percent last month, to an annual rate of 1.006 million, seasonally adjusted. Residential construction dropped nearly 40 percent in 2007 as a whole.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits for new buildings, a leading indicator of housing construction, dropped 34 percent last year. Permits slowed by 8 percent in December, to a 1.068 million annual rate.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have been plagued for months by a deep backlog of unsold homes, despite a steep decline in prices. Many potential buyers appear to be waiting for prices to fall further; others cannot obtain a mortgage because of the recent problems in the credit market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said that builders would continue scaling back this year to wring out the current inventory overhang.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Builders are making precious little headway in clearing inventories, despite generous incentives and aggressive price cutting,'' wrote Richard Moody, chief economist at Mission Residential in Austin, Tex. ''We will see significantly slower single family building activity in 2008.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment buildings and other multifamily dwellings had recorded an uptick in November, as some builders hoped to take advantage of tighter lending standards that have kept some families from obtaining mortgages. But that trend appears to have tapered off: groundbreakings for multifamily homes fell more than 40 percent last month and permits declined after increasing in November.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Thursday, the Labor Department reported that the number of workers filing first-time claims for jobless benefits dropped by 21,000 last week. But the number of so-called continued claims -- those who are still on benefit rolls after having drawn an initial week of aid -- rose by 66,000 to 2.75 million in the week that ended Jan. 5, which was the latest week for which figures were available.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week moving average of new claims -- a more accurate gauge of labor market trends because it irons out volatility in the week-to-week figures -- fell for a third week, to 328,500, from 340,250 the week before.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the gloomy economic news, a measure of manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia area unexpectedly fell to its lowest level since 2001. Manufacturing business significantly shrank this month, according to the Federal Reserve's Philadelphia index, which dropped to minus 20.9 from minus 1.6 in December. Negative readings indicate contraction.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Production costs rose and orders fell for Philadelphia-area businesses. Payrolls also shrank, according to the Fed's survey.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MIAMI has had a condominium building boom over the last several years, with aggressive marketing of a flashy lifestyle and a lot of foreign buyers eager to get into the market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan has, too.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Miami, a lot of those buildings are now sitting empty, the units unsold, some of the first victims of the national turndown.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that hasn't happened in Manhattan. So, what is the difference?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were almost as many condos built in Miami as there were in Manhattan. The difference comes in what local buyers are willing to pay.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the commercial real estate brokerage firm, estimates that Manhattan will end up with 32,543 new condos from the latest boom, which began in 2005, in a borough with 737,768 total households, according to census data.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Miami, 100,000 units were planned for all of Miami-Dade County, which has 828,944 households. But Jack McCabe, a real estate consultant in Deerfield Beach, Fla., estimates that as few as 26,000 of those have been or will be finished.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan buyers spent a median of $864,397 on condos in the third quarter of 2007, according to Prudential Douglas Elliman. The median in Miami was $346,800, according to the National Association of Realtors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McCabe said a majority of newly built condos in Miami cost about $500,000, with many running more than $1 million each. ''People who live here can't afford these condos,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the number of condo sales in Miami dropped by 53 percent in November from the year before, according to data tracked by the University of Florida and the Florida Association of Realtors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These fundamentals helped draw some foreign buyers away from Miami to Manhattan, where they felt their investments were safer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jacky Teplitzky, a broker for Prudential Douglas Elliman in Manhattan, found that after the credit crunch, she was flooded with calls from foreign buyers who had lost faith in the Miami market and wanted to buy in Manhattan.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In Miami, the majority of the people are buying second homes, third homes and investment properties,'' Ms. Teplitzky said. ''More than 80 percent of the people who buy in Manhattan buy here to live. So the foreigners view Manhattan much more as a stable market.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She also said Manhattan has a shrinking inventory of condos while in Miami, the numbers are rising.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The trend in Manhattan is that we're going down in inventory,'' she said. ''But the trend in Miami is going up.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankruptcy filings began climbing last year, as the housing crisis and rising consumer debt began to take their toll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Filings plummeted in 2006 after reaching unusual heights in 2005, when consumers rushed to declare bankruptcy before a tough new law took effect that October. Total filings of both consumer and business bankruptcies last year were still far below what they were in 2004, the last ''normal'' year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the number reached nearly 819,000 in 2007, according to Automated Access to Court Electronic Records, a bankruptcy data and management company in Oklahoma City. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody'sEconomy.com, predicts it will exceed one million this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The traditional reasons for bankruptcy -- illness, divorce and job loss -- haven't gone away,'' said Deborah K. Thorne, an assistant professor of sociology at Ohio University whose expertise is in consumer debt and bankruptcy. ''With houses no longer A.T.M.'s for paying bills, that escape route is gone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevada, with 10,666 filings in 2007, had the highest year-over-year increase in bankruptcy filings, at 110 percent, according to court records that A.A.C.E.R. examined. California, the nation's most populous state, was second with 70,638 filings, up 87 percent. With 38,981 total filings, Tennessee had the most per capita.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People have two main options in seeking bankruptcy protection. They can file under Chapter 7, the so-called fresh start, which eliminates many unsecured debts like credit card charges and medical bills. Or they can file a Chapter 13 reorganization plan, which allows them to save their homes and cars but often requires that they repay some unsecured debts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers who make more than their state's median income must pass a means test to file for Chapter 7, a crucial new element of current bankruptcy law. ''It is rare for a household with income less than $100,000 not to pass the Chapter 7 means test,'' said Henry J. Sommer, president of the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those who do not pass the test, their only other bankruptcy remedy is usually Chapter 13.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to an analysis of court records by Robert M. Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law, about 30 percent of those filing for bankruptcy protection throughout 2004 chose Chapter 13. But last November, Chapter 13s accounted for almost 40 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Rao, a bankruptcy specialist and lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center in Boston, said he saw a spike six months ago in Chapter 13 filings because of consumers' mortgage problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Lawless, a bankruptcy specialist, also saw a connection between foreclosures and Chapter 13 filings. ''The new law has contributed to a higher percentage of Chapter 13s, but the mortgage crisis undoubtedly plays a role,'' he said. ''Distressed homeowners traditionally file Chapter 13 to save their homes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Las Vegas, Judge Bruce A. Markell of United States Bankruptcy Court has seen a larger percentage of Chapter 13s lately. But an increasing number are ''placeholder'' filings by consumers who have no possibility of affording their mortgages' resetting interest rates, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless a creditor is very diligent, a Chapter 13 filing stays a foreclosure for two or three months, Judge Markell explained: ''The placeholder filing buys you time to time to maneuver, to find another location.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But James F. Molleur, a bankruptcy lawyer in Saco, Me., said federal oversight, required under the new law, is also increasing the percentage of Chapter 13 filings, by focusing on debtors who file for Chapter 7. ''The Department of Justice's Trustee Program, which supervises bankruptcy law,'' he said, ''is conducting audits and investigations, looking for above-median-income debtors who file Chapter 7s and aggressively working to push them into Chapter 13s.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jane Limprecht, a spokeswoman for the United States Trustee Program at the Justice Department, said it had no comment on Mr. Molleur's claim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legislation pending in Congress could spur still more people to choose Chapter 13 to save their homes. For primary residences, the bills would allow bankruptcy judges to lower interest rates and reduce values to the current appraisals. These powers are similar to those that bankruptcy judges have for other types of secured loans under Chapter 13.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Current bankruptcy law makes it easier for debtors to keep vacation homes, investment property and yachts than it does for them to keep their residences,'' said Mr. Sommer, of the bankruptcy lawyers' association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financial services industry opposes the legislation. Steve Bartlett, president and chief executive of the Financial Services Roundtable, an association in Washington representing the nation's largest lenders and securities dealers, said such changes would be ''a disaster for both consumers and the economy'' because they would drive up rates on new mortgages for everyone else and further disrupt the global securities market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proponents of the 2005 bankruptcy law say it is working. ''For anybody who has real hardships and can't repay their debts, the bankruptcy safety net remains as strong as ever,'' Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who sponsored the legislation changing the bankruptcy rules as a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in an e-mail message.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The reforms to bankruptcy law have helped ensure that people who are able to repay their debts are taking responsibility for at least some of their bills,'' Senator Grassley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lois R. Lupica, a professor at the University of Maine School of Law, argued that there have never been many abusers in the bankruptcy system. ''What reform -- and I use that word loosely -- did was to make bankruptcy more expensive and cumbersome to file, and to scare people away from it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Lawless said that with consumers' debts higher than ever, ''only the increased cost of filing bankruptcy under the new law'' explains why there are fewer filings than under the old law. The new law's ambiguities, as well as increased liability for lawyers and demands for more paperwork on short deadlines, have pushed up legal fees considerably, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to pay for Chapter 7 legal fees upfront in cash,'' he said. ''You can be too poor to go bankrupt.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judge Markell in Nevada said the normal fee for a Chapter 13 in Las Vegas is now around $4,300, up from about $2,700 before the new law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chapter 13 may be the only remedy for wealthy consumers whose homes are worth less than they owe or who have unmanageable unsecured debts. ''Some considering bankruptcy will be shocked to find they may not be able to get a clean slate under the new law,'' said Jeffrey S. Conner, a San Francisco real estate lawyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone who wants a Chapter 13, which has always had debt limits, can get one. ''It's easy to be over the caps with home prices in places like California, and people who can no longer file a Chapter 7 are neither fish nor fowl,'' said David A. Tilem, a bankruptcy lawyer in Glendale, Calif. Their only bankruptcy remedy is a pricey plan under Chapter 11, which is used mostly by businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward Alexander, 42, a Maine Army National Guard recruiter in Sanford, Me., decided to declare bankruptcy last year after a lender foreclosed on his house in Key West, Fla. The house had a $300,000 appraised value, $100,000 less than Mr. Alexander owed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I panicked,'' he recalled. ''I figured the lender was going to come after me hard.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pushed over Maine's median income by his National Guard per diem, Mr. Alexander passed the means test for a Chapter 7. But Mr. Molleur advised him to make a filing under Chapter 13, through which he will pay a total $2,000 over five years on the $100,000 delinquency and avoid tax liability on it. ''I feel like the lead balloon over my head has gone away,'' Mr. Alexander said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Molleur has a different take. ''The Trustee Program feels vindicated by having more Chapter 13s to pad their statistics,'' he said, ''but many unsecured creditors do not really benefit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph Giacobbe, a mortgage specialist in Manhattan, and his wife felt the long arm of the United States Trustee Program after filing for Chapter 7 last April. They sought relief from $69,000 in unsecured debt, including $52,000 in credit card bills, partly incurred when the couple quit their jobs to care for Ms. Giacobbe's ailing parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Filing for bankruptcy has been a nightmare, Mr. Giacobbe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From his experience in the mortgage business, Mr. Giacobbe said he believed that only a Chapter 7 would help the couple's beleaguered credit scores recover quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About two weeks after filing, the Giacobbes learned they were being audited at the direction of the Trustee Program, their lawyer, Stephen G. Doherty of Doylestown, Pa., said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, the Trustee Program argued that based on the couple's income and expenses, the couple did not qualify for a Chapter 7. Rather than fight the federal government in court, the Giacobbes voluntarily converted to a Chapter 13. A judge dismissed the Giacobbes' case on Wednesday after a trustee said payments had not arrived, and Mr. Doherty is now working to have the case reinstated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crystal Erickson, 33, an artist and teacher in Portland, Me., is considering bankruptcy as she tries to communicate with her lender about a two-family dwelling she and her fiance, Dobol Luak, 34, a student, bought in September 2004. Ms. Erickson said the couple were not informed that they were taking out an interest-only loan with resetting interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple managed to make payments after the first reset but could not afford them after the second one last summer. The lender moved to foreclose late last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a Chapter 13 case, a judge can change the terms of a loan for consumers who were victims of predatory lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't want to move,'' Ms. Erickson said. ''We're part of this community, and from working with kids who live in public housing, I see that communities are created or destroyed depending on whether people have ownership in their homes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Henry, 48, a maintenance technician and single father from Madisonville, Tenn., said he reluctantly filed for Chapter 7 protection last year after spending most of his savings to pay medical bills. His legal fees were $1,350 and his court costs were $299.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I felt a little relieved, but mostly guilty because I've always paid my debts all my life,'' Mr. Henry said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Pending home sales dipped in November, a trade group for real estate agents said on Tuesday, but the association expects sales to pick up in the second half of 2008.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest indication that the housing market's struggles are not over, the National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday that its seasonally adjusted index of pending sales for existing homes fell 2.6 percent to a reading of 87.6 from an upwardly revised 89.9 in October.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts warned of continued problems in the housing market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The best thing you can say about pending home sales is that they aren't getting much worse,'' Michael D. Larson, a real estate analyst at Weiss Research in Jupiter, Fla., said in a statement. But with the labor market weakening, ''you have the recipe for ongoing trouble in housing.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech on Tuesday, the chief executive of the mortgage finance company Fannie Mae, Daniel H. Mudd, said home prices would ''perhaps begin to gain modestly'' in 2010.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors index, which was down 19.2 percent from a year ago, hit a record low of 85.5 in August at the peak of the worldwide credit squeeze.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically there is a one- to two-month lag between the time that a buyer signs a home sales contract and the closing of the deal. So the November reading should reflect sales that were completed last month and into this month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index reading of 100 is equal to the average level of sales activity in 2001, when the index started.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Final results for existing-home sales in 2007 -- to be released this month -- are expected to be down 12.7 percent from 6.48 million in 2006, the Realtors group said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade group also projected existing-home sales would increase 0.9 percent this year to 5.7 million, up from a projected 5.65 million last year. The 2008 forecast was unchanged from last month. The group also forecast 5.91 million home sales in 2009.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The exact timing and the strength of a home sales recovery are a bit uncertain,'' Lawrence Yun, the group's chief economist, said in a statement. ''A meaningful recovery in existing-home sales could occur as early as this spring, or it may be further delayed toward late 2008.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other economic news, the Federal Reserve reported a rebound in consumer borrowing during November as credit card debt posted its biggest gain in six months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed said Tuesday that consumer credit shot up at an annual rate of 7.4 percent after a gain of 1 percent in October.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The category that includes credit card debt was up at an annual rate of 11.3 percent, reflecting shoppers' use of the cards to finance purchases now that home equity lines of credit are harder to get.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The category that includes auto loans rose in November, but at a more moderate rate of 5.1 percent after having fallen 3.5 percent in October.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the housing market across the country continued to stagnate in the fourth quarter of last year, the market in Manhattan set a record, according to reports to be released on Thursday by four of the city's major real estate brokerage firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price for an apartment reached $1.4 million in the last quarter of 2007, up 17.6 percent from the fourth quarter of 2006, according to data tracked by the brokerage firm Prudential Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reports noted, however, that average prices were being pushed to record levels because of the increasing number of apartments selling at the top end of the market, above $10 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many other indicators also showed that the Manhattan sales market remained strong: the number of apartment sales jumped by 3.2 percent, compared with the same time period the year before; apartments sold an average of 18 days faster than they did a year ago; and the inventory of apartments for sale shrunk by 13.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every single indicator that we tracked showed a gain,'' said Jonathan Miller, the executive vice president and director of research of Radar Logic, who prepared the data for Prudential Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The record prices can be credited largely to Manhattan's wealthiest buyers. The number of apartments that sold for more than $10 million tripled in the past year, according to data tracked by two other brokerages, Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property. Many of these deals were at 15 Central Park West and at the Plaza, two buildings in which 94 of the 1,342 condos sold in Manhattan in the fourth quarter are located.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory J. Heym, an economist who prepared the reports for Halstead and Brown Harris Stevens, said that sales at those two buildings helped drive up average condo prices by $500,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said that he had not seen the luxury market drive Manhattan real estate prices so profoundly since 2000, when buyers poured wealth from the dot-com boom into high-end apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is not to say that these high-end transactions will shield Manhattan real estate from a slowdown in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate brokers predict that sales prices may not keep up this pace through 2008 because more buyers could have trouble taking out large mortgages and some Wall Street bankers may receive smaller cash bonuses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not forecasting high appreciation,'' said Dottie Herman, the president of Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''I'm forecasting that the market will be flat'' in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-ops, which typically cost less than condominiums, are clearly lagging behind condos in terms of financial performance. According to the Prudential Douglas Elliman report, the average condo price jumped by 17.8 percent in the last quarter of 2007 over the same period a year earlier, the average co-op price rose by 9.1 percent. Mr. Miller said that the inventory of co-ops for sale dropped by 26.2 percent, at least in part because some sellers took their co-ops off the market, hoping to try again in the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, real estate brokers and economists point out that the overall market has performed just as well as the luxury market. In fact, half of the sales in Manhattan involved apartments that sold for less than $828,0000, according to data tracked by Halstead Property and Brown Harris Stevens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The marketplace is not being held afloat by just the high end,'' said Diane Ramirez, president of Halstead Property. ''We have great demand across the board.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers paid high prices for apartments in Harlem, where condos drove up average prices by 93 percent, to $895,000, , largely because of new construction. Apartments at the new condominium building at 111 Central Park North, which accounted for 21 of the 108 sales in Harlem, sold for an average of $2.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some outlying neighborhoods in Manhattan, however, are already experiencing a minor slowdown. The median sales price for apartments in Inwood dropped by 4 percent, to $299,000, in the past year and by 5 percent, to $412,500, in Hudson Heights, according to Halstead Properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barak Dunayer, president of Barak Realty, said that prices were definitely flat in those neighborhoods and that fewer owners there were putting their apartments up for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Brooklyn co-ops and condos sold for an average of $661,000, compared with $613,000 at the same time the year before, some segments of the market experienced a slowdown, according to data tracked by <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group.</span> Median prices on two-bedroom Park Slope apartments dropped by 4 percent, to $637,000. Median prices for two-bedroom apartments in Fort Greene and Clinton Hill dropped by as much as 14 percent, to $462,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela Liebman, president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, which also studied Manhattan figures, attributed the price drops to fewer closings for apartments in high-priced new buildings. She said that Brooklyn over all has settled into a stable rhythm because it was not experiencing the drastic price jumps of recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Brooklyn showed its maturity this year because the appreciation was much more steady,'' she said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of previously owned homes nudged up in November, but that was not enough to improve the broader picture of a housing market racked by record-high foreclosures and harder-to-get credit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors reported on Monday that sales of existing single-family homes, condominiums and town houses rose 0.4 percent in November from October, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of five million units. Even with the small increase, the pace of sales was still the second-lowest on record going back to 1999. The lowest pace -- 4.98 million -- was in October.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's little reason to pop open any Champagne corks,'' a real estate analyst at Weiss Research, Michael Larson, said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales are down 20 percent from November 2006, underscoring the problems plaguing the housing sector. Economists had been predicting that sales would either move up slightly or hold steady for November.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices continued to sink. The median price of a home sold in November was $210,200. That was a 3.3 percent drop from a year ago. It was the fifth-biggest annual decline on record. The median price is the point at which half sell for more and half sell for less.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region of the country, sales were mixed. Existing home sales jumped 10.3 percent in November from October in the West. They were flat in the Midwest. However, they fell 2 percent in the South and 3.3 percent in the Northeast.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of unsold homes in November was 4.27 million. At the current sales pace, it would take 10.3 months to deplete that overhang.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Inventory is still high and further reduction in prices may be required in some areas to induce buyers back into the market,'' the association's chief economist, Lawrence Yun, said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dip in 30-year mortgage rates in November probably helped give nationwide existing-home sales the small lift, the association suggested. Mr. Yun thought the small increase could be taken as a sign that the market might be stabilizing. That said, previous signs of stabilization in 2007 had been dashed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been suffering through a slump after five years of record-breaking activity from 2001 through 2005. Sales turned weak as did home prices.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders are sharply curtailing construction and cutting prices across the country as they struggle to break out of the worst housing slump since the early 1990s. But buyers remain scarce, and analysts say the market may not bottom out until well into next year or even later.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes plunged to a 12-year low in November, an annual pace of just 647,000, the government said Friday. That is the slowest pace since April 1995, when sales ran at a pace of 621,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home purchases are down 34.4 percent from a year earlier, the biggest year-over-year drop since January 1991. That leaves a large, if shrinking, inventory of unsold homes to be worked off before the glut can be dissipated.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans appear to be holding out for real estate prices to drop even further in 2008.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right now there is a huge gulf between what buyers are willing to pay for a house and what sellers are willing to take for it,'' said Mark Vitner, senior economist at  <span class="companylink">Wachovia.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as new homes become more affordable, the Friday report from the Commerce Department underscores the challenges facing the residential construction industry as tighter credit and the fear of further declines in values continue to shrink the pool of potential buyers. Rising foreclosures and a wave of cancellations have crippled the nation's biggest home builders and sent their stock prices into a steep decline.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of  <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> and D. R. Horton both fell more than 4 percent in trading on Friday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are sitting on the sidelines for a good reason,'' said Patrick Newport, an economist at Global Insight, an economic research firm in Lexington, Mass. ''You're taking a big risk because the asset you are buying may depreciate a lot between now and a year from now.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Newport said builders would have to keep cutting prices to entice buyers back into the market. Until then, they face a supply surplus of nine months' worth of unsold homes. While groundbreakings have slowed, Friday's report suggests the backlog is still damping demand.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sales are dropping at such a pace that the pullback in new home building remains insufficient to make any headway in clearing out the sizable inventories of new homes for sales,'' Richard Moody, chief economist at Mission Residential, wrote in a research note.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say home sales could bottom out as early as the middle of 2008 but any recovery will be gradual. ''The laws of supply and demand will work,'' Mr. Vitner said. ''We built around 800,000 more units of housing than the market needed. It's going to take us a couple of years of reduced home construction in order to clear up its excess.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Statistically, the size of the slump is staggering. In the summer of 2005, annual sales of new single-family homes hit a high of 1.39 million. They have since dropped to an annual rate of 647,000 -- a loss of 53.4 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current decline is the steepest peak-to-trough drop since the 1982 housing bust, said Michael T. Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners, and it could grow steeper if sales continue to flag. Still, he took a slightly more optimistic view of the data.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With prices going down and income continuing to grow, that's helped to push up affordability,'' he said, adding that the industry appeared to be coming closer to ''the lows of this cycle.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in the housing market, while long predicted by many economists, caught many home builders by surprise. In 2006, companies like  <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> were predicting they could easily ride out any slowdown. And Donald J. Tomnitz, the chief executive of D. R. Horton, predicted that his company, the largest home builder in the nation, ''can earn our way through any economic cycle, except one like the Great Depression.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest change occurred after the subprime market collapsed in the spring, which led to a temporary freeze in the lending and mortgage markets this summer. Buyers vanished; new-home sales have dropped nearly 25 percent since April.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was one mildly hopeful sign for builders in Friday's report. The number of unsold new homes on the market has gradually fallen over the last year, and it dropped another 1.8 percent in November.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previously reported sales for August, September and October, however, were revised downward by the Commerce Department. Sales dipped from October to November in every region of the country except the West, which had a 4 percent rise. The steepest drop occurred in the Midwest, at 27.6 percent. Northeastern sales fell 19.3 percent and sales in the South fell 6.4 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a new single-family home dropped in November to $239,100, a 0.4 percent decline from a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That number masks the real fall in prices: more expensive homes are the ones most likely to sell because the remaining buyers are likely to be affluent, and builders have been offering increasingly costly hidden incentives to encourage buyers to take their completed homes off their hands.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE slide in American home prices is going national, rendering obsolete the old saying that the three factors that matter in real estate pricing are location, location and location.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are still important differences in the vibrancy of local economies, but those distinctions are being overridden by a mortgage market that has made it much more difficult for many would-be buyers to obtain financing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The  <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller indexes of home prices, which began in 1987 and now cover 20 broad metropolitan areas, have showed price declines in every market in only two months -- September and October of this year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those falls came as the stringent mortgage rules began to take effect, leaving even vigorous local economies with financing problems for home buyers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The October figures, reported this week, showed that only three of the 20 markets still had year-over-year increases in prices: Charlotte, N.C.; Seattle; and Portland, Ore. Of those, only Charlotte's prices rose rapidly enough to offset inflation. The consumer price index excluding shelter costs was up 3.7 percent over the year, while Charlotte prices climbed 4.3 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September and October were the first months ever in which the S.&amp; P./Case-Shiller indexes failed to show any market with at least a 5 percent annual gain, as is shown in the accompanying chart.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the current slowdown affects all markets, it is generally worse in those that went up the most in the housing boom. During the five-year period that ended in July 2006 -- when national housing prices peaked, according to the indexes -- seven markets showed compound annual gains of at least 14 percent. Since the peak, all seven markets are among the bottom eight. What goes up the most does come down the most, or so it appears.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exception to that rule is Detroit, home of the troubled American automobile industry. It was the worst performing market during the boom, and it is among the worst since.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures shown in the chart are the annual rates of change over the 15 months since the peak, with the fastest rate of decline in the Tampa, Fla., region.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is Miami, the other Florida market covered by the indexes, that has been going down at the fastest rate over the last year. Prices there fell 12.4 percent in the 12 months through October. That is the most rapid fall the indexes have ever recorded, exceeding the 11.2 percent decline the Boston area showed in the 12 months through February 1991.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The indexes are compiled by comparing repeated sales of the same homes, and the 20 regions are broad enough to cover entire areas. The New York market, for example, stretches from New Haven to Trenton.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The indexes cover only single-family home sales, not sales of condominium apartments. In the Florida markets, where condo prices have suffered badly because of speculative overbuilding, that means the indexes may be understating the distress.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the early 1990s there was something close to a national weakening of home prices during and after the 1991 recession. But at the low point, the S.&amp; P./Case-Shiller indexes still showed annual price gains in five of the 17 markets the indexes then covered. And there were no months when at least one market did not show a gain from the previous month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now prices appear to be weakening everywhere.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By VIKAS BAJAJ   </div><div>988 words</div><div>27 December 2007</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2007 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in home prices accelerated and spread to more regions of the country in October, according to data released Wednesday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices fell 6.1 percent from October 2006 in 20 large metropolitan areas, according to  <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller indexes, compared with a 4.9 percent decline in September. On a monthly basis, prices fell 1.4 percent in October, the fastest they have declined in at least the last seven years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All but three of the 20 regions experienced a fall in real estate values, and even the three areas -- Seattle, Portland, Ore., and Charlotte, N.C. -- where prices were up from a year ago, had a decline from a month earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quickening pace of decline could hurt the broader economy by leading to more foreclosures as homeowners have difficulty refinancing mortgages and by sapping consumer spending as Americans feel less wealthy. But economists also said that a faster descent from boom-era prices would allow the housing market to right itself sooner by encouraging the sale of vacant homes and reducing the inventory of properties on the market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the boom, rising home prices increased consumer spending because people felt more wealthy and were able to borrow against their new home equity. Now that process is reversing itself, said Patrick Newport, an economist at Global Insight, a research firm outside Boston. ''And the foreclosure rates are going to go up a little more. If prices are falling, you are more likely to default'' because the house may be worth less than the mortgage on it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, weakness in housing and the credit markets has been offset by strong exports and rising wages. Consumer spending in the holiday season has been weaker than some retailers had hoped, though reports indicate that it is still growing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It has been surprisingly resilient,'' Robert J. Shiller, the Yale economist and a creator of the home price indexes, said about the economy. He added that it was difficult to determine what impact the weakness in housing would have on the economy going forward.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are in uncharted territory,'' he said. ''This was the biggest housing boom we have ever seen.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Mr. Shiller's calculation, the decline in home prices is greater than at any time since 1941, when the housing market was faltering at the start of the American entry in World War II. Since their peak in July 2006, home prices in the 20 regions have dropped 6.6 percent. Many economists are predicting that home prices will fall 10 percent to 15 percent from their peak to their trough, though some pessimists say the drop could be as much as 30 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are dropping fastest in the Midwest, which has been hit hard by job losses in manufacturing, and in California, Florida and the Southwest, where the housing boom was most pronounced.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have fallen the most in Miami (down 12.4 percent from a year ago), Tampa (11.8 percent) and Detroit (11.2 percent). Prices are also falling in the nation's two largest metropolitan areas -- Los Angeles (8.8 percent) and New York (4.1 percent).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Charlotte, Seattle and Portland, where the local economies are somewhat healthier, prices were up from a year ago but lower than in September. Dallas and Atlanta, where prices were strong earlier in the year, experienced declines over the previous month and the year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It suggests to me that the psychological factor is very important,'' Mr. Shiller said. ''Even in cities that are doing well, people see what is going on nationwide and they don't want to bid as much.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A real estate broker at Brio Realty in Bellevue, Wash., Ardell DellaLoggia, said home buyers whom she represents had become more cautious about how much they were willing to offer for homes because they were unsure about the future. Stricter lending standards have also made it harder for buyers to get jumbo loans larger than $417,000, and lenders are again requiring sizable down payments for all kinds of loans.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Paying as low as you can is your insurance to whatever may happen in the next couple of years,'' Ms. DellaLoggia said, adding that she did not have to cut the prices on any of the homes she had sold recently. ''But it took 90 days to get an offer instead of 30.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales of single-family homes and condos in the Seattle area fell by a third in September from the same month last year, according to data from the Northwest Multiple Listing Service. The number of homes on the market has also been rising fast.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward E. Leamer, an economist at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the declines in Seattle and elsewhere should not be surprising because they were also caught up in the housing boom that was fueled by low interest rates and lax lending standards.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Finance is not local,'' he said as a counterpoint to the maxim that real estate is local. ''The availability of mortgages at extremely easy terms affected every home in the United States.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller indexes, which Mr. Shiller created with Karl E. Case, an economics professor at Wellesley College, track same-home sales over time in an effort to remove the influence of the changing composition of properties sold from month to month. The government has a similar index based on mortgages bought by Fannie Mae and  <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> that covers more of the country but does not track sales where jumbo loans are used.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks fell modestly after the latest home price data was released Wednesday morning, but the market closed essentially flat for the day.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE Time Warner Center was New York's premier development when it opened a few years ago, and it has come a long way since.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 2004, Ricky Martin, the pop star, bought a new apartment on the 65th floor of the south tower for $6.8 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment is a four-bedroom condominium with 65 linear feet of floor-to-ceiling windows that overlooked Central Park and Columbus Circle, and Mr. Martin sold it in September 2006 for $9.75 million. He pocketed a 30 percent gain.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, he paid about $6.3 million for a condo in another new development, at 40 Bond Street.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now comes word that the buyers of Mr. Martin's  <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> condo have signed a contract to flip it, a little more than a year later, for about $17.9 million, according to brokers, not quite doubling their money.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the listing by Elizabeth Lee Sample and Brenda S. Powers, brokers at Brown Harris Stevens, the buyers had actually enlarged the apartment a bit by getting permission to incorporate a slice of the hallway into the apartment to create ''a formal foyer, which leads into a grand gallery with direct Central Park views.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale price was about $1 million below the initial asking price of $18.9 million when the apartment went on the market in early October. The sale price works out to roughly $5,885 a square foot.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market, in its deepest rut since the early 1990s, showed little sign of climbing out in November, and economists said that they expected conditions to worsen in the near term.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of groundbreakings for new homes fell 3.7 percent in November, to a 1.187 million annual pace, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. Permits for new home projects, an indicator of future building activity, dropped to 1.152 million, the lowest annual pace in more than 14 years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders have been stymied in recent months by a significant tightening of credit among mortgage lenders and a drop-off in demand, leading to sharp declines in house prices and a rise in inventories.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Housing market conditions were already in quite bad shape when credit market turmoil intensified in August,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, wrote in a research note. ''With mortgage financing further constrained and inventories of unsold homes much too high, the near-to-medium-term outlook for housing starts is poor.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report reflected a shift toward multifamily structures, like apartment buildings and condominiums, as builders predict that more families will have difficulty obtaining mortgages in the months ahead.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Groundbreakings for multifamily units ticked up last month, keeping pace with a 22 percent rise over the last 12 months. Single-family starts have plummeted 24 percent in the same period.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders appear to be realizing that the drop in demand is not likely to be reversed anytime soon. Analysts and others said that last month's decline in groundbreakings and permits fell short of correcting the supply problems roiling the market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The scope of the declines remains too small to make a meaningful dent in the inventory overhang that continues to loom over the housing market,'' Richard Moody, chief economist at Mission Residential, wrote in a research note.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The continuing problems in housing could contribute to slowing economic growth in the next few months. Some economists have predicted that residential investment could shave more than a percentage point from growth in the gross domestic product over the next two quarters.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QWe recently bought a condominium on the Upper West Side that was advertised by the seller's broker as having ''approximately 975 square feet.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the sale closed, we found the original architect's documentation of the square footage, which gave the total as 824 square feet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the price we paid was based on the higher square footage figure, do we have a legal basis for a suit, and are we likely to succeed?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Edward T. Braverman, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that a condominium, unlike a co-op, is classified as real property. As such, any representations or warranties made before the closing (and even those in the contract of sale) expire upon closing, unless specific provision is made for their survival.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It would be highly unlikely that a provision concerning the square-foot area of an apartment would be made to survive closing,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, Mr. Braverman said, the standard contract of sale for a condo in New York includes an acknowledgment that the buyer has inspected the apartment and agrees to accept it in ''as is'' condition.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also specifies that the buyer ''does not rely on any representations made by any broker,'' he said, and it gives the buyer the opportunity to measure the apartment at a convenient time before the closing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These standard provisions virtually eliminate the possibility of a buyer's claiming that he has relied on prior representation concerning the size of the unit,'' Mr. Braverman said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, the letter writer indicates that the statement about the apartment's square footage used the word ''approximately.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Such language, coupled with the fact that there is no standard form of measurement in New York City, would further preclude a recovery,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, measurements used to determine the square footage are made from the outer surface of an exterior wall of the building to the midpoint of the wall to the hallway or the one separating the apartment from its neighbor.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other cases, the measurements are only for the apartment's usable interior space. JAY ROMANO   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT may be that the gloom and falling prices in the national real estate scene will engulf the lofty heights of the luxury real estate market in Manhattan next year, but sales figures through November do not indicate a collapse in prices. In fact, some co-ops, condominiums and town houses are flying off the shelves in brokerage firms across the city.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the number of closed sales just about matched the number closed in November 2006, and prices were considerably higher, but roughly flat compared with the prices in the previous quarter, according to a review of sales records filed with the city.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the upside, a search of listings on StreetEasy, a real estate Web site, showed a steady stream of old and new buildings going into contract within 30 days of their listing. Some trophy listings may languish for years, but Devonee Banchik, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, had better luck when she put her own town house at 161 West 73rd Street on the market on Nov. 10.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She went through a divorce a few years ago and said that she and two daughters no longer needed the space in the 19-foot newly renovated town house, with two market-rate tenants upstairs. She had signed a contract to buy a smaller apartment at the Element, a 35-story condominium going up on West 59th Street, with a pool and the kind of services you can't get in a town house.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She listed her house for $6.495 million. The first week it was on the market, a couple who lived just around the corner on West 74th Street looked at the apartment. The second week they came back with an architect. The third week they negotiated a contract, Ms. Banchik said. It was listed as ''in contract'' on Nov. 26; the elapsed time was 16 days.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Banchik's buyers took a bit longer to sell their own ''triple-mint newly renovated duplex with private garden in landmarked building,'' at 159 West 74th Street. The apartment with an asking price of $2.6 million ''languished'' on the market for 41 days, but the selling broker, Lauren Muss of  <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, had an explanation. ''We had a contract on it right away,'' she said. ''The original people backed out, and we had three backup offers.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sellers are really not coming down'' in their asking prices, she said, and noted that inventories were tight. ''Buyers buy because there is no choice,'' she added.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Francesca Mannarino-Werz, a Corcoran broker, said she had received a signed contract on a four-bedroom duplex loft at 303 Mercer Street within nine days. The asking price was $2.595 million. She said the sellers had just completed renovations but had to relocate out of town. ''Properties that are priced well, sell well,'' she said. ''Our team had a very big month in November.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Ms. Banchik, she and her former husband have been spending more time together, and she said that since she signed a contract to buy at the Element, they had ''miraculously reconciled.'' The West 73rd Street sale will continue as planned.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just south of Los Angeles, there is a small city called Paramount where houses have all but stopped selling.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a city of bungalows and manicured lawns, far enough from downtown to have long been affordable to working-class families. But as home prices rose ever higher in other parts of Southern California, Paramount became all the more attractive -- and prices eventually soared there as well. By last year, the typical house sold for almost $500,000, up from $200,000 in early 2003.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of those sales depended on adjustable-rate mortgages with tantalizingly low initial payments, and now that those mortgages are much harder to get, there aren't many buyers willing and able to pay $500,000. Yet sellers in Paramount haven't adjusted to the new reality by cutting their prices very much. Instead, the real estate market has frozen.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday, Luis Perez and his wife, Hilda, held their fourth open house since putting their apricot-colored stucco home on the market in August. They have reduced the price once, by about 5 percent. They still haven't received a single offer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the summer, only about three homes a week -- including houses and condominiums -- have sold in Paramount. In the third quarter of this year, only 30 homes changed hands, down from 134 in the third quarter of last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That 78 percent drop is bigger than the decline in any other ZIP code in the country, according to an analysis that a research firm called  <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> Information Systems did for me. The biggest declines can generally be found in moderate-income towns on the outskirts of major metropolitan areas, where adjustable-rate mortgages had become the norm. (In more affluent areas across the Northeast and California, the declines haven't been so big.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In parts of Florida, Arizona and Nevada, home sales have fallen more than 60 percent over the last year. In several ZIP codes in California's Inland Empire, east of Los Angeles, the decline is greater than 70 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But no other place can match Paramount, the capital of the great home sales bust of 2007.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year has been filled with predictions that the bottom of the real estate cycle was oh so close. In January, Donald L. Kohn, the vice chairman of the Fed, said that housing starts ''may be not very far from their trough.'' They have since fallen an additional 21 percent and are well below where they were for most of the 1970s. In recent weeks, some Wall Street analysts hopefully guessed that the mortgage-related credit crunch was entering its final phase. Instead, the giant bank  <span class="companylink">UBS</span>, in need of cash, sold nearly 10 percent of itself to the Singapore government this week.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the standoff between buyers and sellers in Paramount helps explain why we're still a long way from the bottom of the cycle. No matter how big a mortgage rescue plan the federal government puts together, no matter how much further the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, the worst housing slump on record is going to continue into 2008 and probably beyond. The slump can't end until home prices come back in line with economic reality.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, real estate values rose at roughly the same pace as incomes. Whenever prices got a little ahead of incomes, as they did in the late 1980s, they would quickly settle back down again. The recent boom was different: in just six years -- from 2000 to 2006, even as incomes were growing slowly -- the average home nearly doubled in price.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that housing has lost its speculative luster and mortgages are harder to get, homes sales are plummeting, down more than 30 percent over the last two years. And as Thomas Lawler, a real estate analyst based in northern Virginia, says, ''Sales numbers tend to be a great leading indicator of prices.'' But it hasn't happened yet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, home prices have fallen only 5 percent from their peak early last year, according to the S.&amp; P./Case-Shiller Composite Home Price Index, the most accurate of the well-known measures. Instead of selling at reduced prices, sellers are holding out, hoping that the good times will somehow return. Paramount is simply an extreme example of the phenomenon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We got to a point in this area where the values far exceeded the capability of the median family,'' said Gary Endo, a real estate agent with Duke &amp; Associates in Paramount. ''So people created a loan to bridge that gap. All they did was create a problem.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Endo added: ''We're going through that transition where sellers can't accept that prices are falling. They're still caught up in this idea that their property is worth more than it is. It's just strange.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some homeowners will do just fine by remaining in their homes. Maria Angel, another real estate agent, said she thought Paramount's sales decline had been so large partly because the city attracts first-time home buyers who often decide to put down roots. If they can't get the price they want, they're happy to stay in their home. (Best piece of Paramount trivia: it's where Zamboni ice-cleaning machines were invented and are still made.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other residents are refusing to sell for a grimmer reason: they're facing a spike in their monthly mortgage payments, and their homes may not be valuable enough to pay off their loans. Mr. Perez, who is 43 and works as a machine operator, bought his house for $380,000 six years ago. He later refinanced his mortgage and took out a home-equity loan. As a result, the interest rate on his new mortgage reset in October, causing the monthly payment to jump $1,300, to $3,900.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If he can't sell the house for something close to the asking price of $549,900, he expects the bank will take it from him. ''The truth is, I don't think my house will sell,'' Mr. Perez said in Spanish, to my colleague, Ana Facio Contreras. ''If in four months I've had no offers, I don't see how I'll get an offer now that it's more difficult to sell.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no perfect solutions at this point. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. has decided to err on the side of caution, gently nudging banks to alter the terms of a small fraction of mortgages headed toward default. Democrats in Congress are pushing for a bigger rescue plan, one that puts more responsibility on the lenders that marketed all those ridiculous mortgages. The Democratic plan is clearly more humane than Mr. Paulson's, but it would also end up subsidizing some wildly irrational home purchases and borrowing choices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either way, the real estate bust will not be over until prices have fallen significantly more than they have so far. That could happen quickly -- starting with a 10 or 15 percent nationwide drop next year -- or over many years, as inflation eats away at home values.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Perez, for one, thinks sanity will return sooner, if not soon enough. ''I assure you that in two years things are going to change,'' he said. ''But that doesn't help me now.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MAP: DISAPPEARING MARKETS: Paramount, Calif., had the biggest drop in the country in home sales over the last year, among the ZIP codes tracked by  <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> Information Systems, a real estate research firm. The top five declines were all in Southern California. (Source:  <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> Information Systems) (pg.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices fell the most in almost 20 years this summer, and consumers remain deeply skeptical about the economy, according to reports released yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of single-family homes in the third quarter fell 4.5 percent nationwide compared with a year ago, according to the  <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index. It was the largest drop since records for the index began in 1988.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate survey by S.&amp; P./Case-Shiller of home prices in 20 major metropolitan areas showed a drop of 4.95 percent in September from a year ago, the biggest decline in more than six years. Prices declined 0.9 percent in September alone, and were down in all 20 areas, the survey found.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller surveys are widely followed by investors, though many market watchers are looking to this week's reports on sales of new and existing homes in October. The three surveys are expected to provide a decidedly bleak portrait of the current housing market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A steady rise in foreclosures tied to the struggling mortgage market has weighed down housing demand, and tightened lending standards have made it more difficult for Americans to get home loans. The result has been a steady drop in value.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are fast approaching the rate of price decline seen at the end of the 1990-91 recession,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, wrote in a research note. ''The odds strongly favor blowing past this mark in coming months.''   </p>
