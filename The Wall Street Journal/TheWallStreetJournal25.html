<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—The number of U.S. workers filing applications for jobless benefits rose last week, though the overall trend suggests the labor market has improved slightly since early this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial jobless claims, an indication of layoffs, increased by 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 366,000 in the week ended Aug. 11, the Labor Department said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expected 365,000 new applications for jobless benefits last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Claims for the week ending Aug. 4 were revised up to 364,000 from an initially reported 361,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week moving average of claims, which smoothes out often choppy weekly data, fell by 5,500 to 363,750, the lowest level since the end of March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Labor Department official said there were no unusual factors in Thursday's report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jobless-claims data have been volatile in recent weeks, and economists have been careful not to read too much into any single report. But the broad trend appears to have improved since June, when claims ranged at about 385,000 a week. July claims averaged 366,000 a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The trend in initial claims will gain more credibility the longer it lasts," Wrightson ICAP said ahead of Thursday's release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically job creation increases when layoffs decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far this year, hiring has been fitful. A separate Labor Department report out early this month showed that the economy added 163,000 jobs in July, the biggest monthly gain since February and a welcome relief after a weak June. But the politically important unemployment rate ticked up to 8.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers at the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> are monitoring the employment situation as they weigh another round of stimulus. At a meeting earlier this month, officials said they "will provide additional accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's policy makers next meet formally on Sept. 12 and 13.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's Labor data showed the number of continuing unemployment-benefit claims—those drawn by workers for more than a week—decreased by 31,000 to 3,305,000 in the week ended Aug. 4. Continuing claims are reported with a one-week lag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of workers requesting unemployment insurance was equivalent to 2.6% of employed workers paying into the system in the week ended Aug. 4, unchanged from the prior week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, U.S. home building slipped in July, while new permits rose to their highest level in four years, a possible sign of confidence for construction going forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts decreased 1.1% last month from June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 746,000, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Compared with a year ago, new construction was up 21.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results were weaker than forecast. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expected July housing starts to fall to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 756,000, a 0.5% drop from June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">June starts were revised down slightly to a rate of 754,000, reflecting a 6.8% increase from the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of single-family homes, which made up more than two-thirds of housing starts last month, fell 6.5% in June to a rate of 502,000 units. Single-family construction was up 17% from last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year's housing starts, while up from a low of 478,000 in April 2009, are still below the historical average. Builders have started construction on about 1.5 million new homes a year since 1959.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an indication of future construction, the number of new housing permits rose 6.8% to an annualized level of 812,000 in July, the highest number since August 2008. That was above economists' estimates for a rate of 770,000, up 1.3% from June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actual housing starts, which are calculated without seasonal adjustments, decreased to 71,700 in July from a revised 74,700 in June. Lumber and commodities market watch those numbers closely to gauge demand.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jackie Bischof and Stefanos Chen </div><div>735 words</div><div>16 August 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A16</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forget high fences, large gates or security patrols. Most privacy-seeking homeowners in the Hamptons stick to nuanced, natural approaches: large estate layouts, long driveways, green landscaping and hidden locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judi Desiderio, chief executive of Town &amp; Country Real Estate who has been working in the Hamptons for 31 years, said while there is always a market for a "sleek modern home," she estimates two-thirds of the houses being built are more traditional -- with privacy one of the top priorities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Whether you're on a half acre or 10 acres, people who come out and purchase homes here don't care to know what their neighbors are having for dinner," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landscaping is a common strategy for keeping wandering eyes out, she said, and over the years it has gotten more creative. People are "framing their properties with different vegetation, so [the trees] don't look like a bunch of soldiers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela and Michael Jacobus bought their house in Amagansett in 1978, and after a renovation in 1997 that saw the addition of a second floor, they replaced an old wooden fence with a row of arborvitae trees. Now the trees are 40 feet high, and the property is also shielded from view by a bamboo hedge, privet hedge and 30-foot-high rhododendron trees. Their four-bedroom, 3 1/2-bathroom house is nestled in the dunes, 50 feet from the street below, and is on the market for $2.5 million with Brown Harris Stevens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using landscaping for privacy has an environmental aspect, says Mr. Jacobus, 67 years old. "Everybody would like a natural environment where they can enjoy the landscaping and gardens without seeing a neighbor's house or road," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large walls require special permits to build in Hamptons hamlets, and as a result, they are not common, says Ernie Cervi, an executive managing director for <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>, who has lived in the Hamptons for 12 years. The "green barrier" trend is a popular alternative because "people do prefer greenery to gates -- it gives you a good screening and it is green all year. It's the first thing they do" when they buy, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another popular strategy is the layout of so-called "flag lots" with a long driveway that leads to a property set back from the road, like a flag waving from a pole. The flag lot and estate layout of a home in Water Mill was a major draw for Jonathan Spier, 51, as he craved privacy and separation from a "bombardment of people and noise" in Manhattan, where he ran a clothing company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Spier bought his nearly six-acre property in 2004. Seeking "quiet time," he instead found that the property -- with segmented areas for a swimming pool, tennis court and reflecting pond -- was so good for entertaining that he frequently had guests. The eight-bedroom, 7 1/2-bathroom property is on the market for $3.999 million with Prudential Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carol Mayo, 74, was less than thrilled about leaving behind the buzz of New York. But when her attorney husband Anthony, 76, decided to open a car dealership in Southampton in the mid-1970s, she figured she might as well commit full-bore. "I told him, if he's going to make me live out here full-time, I want to feel like I live in the country."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tall hedges felt too much like "suburbia" to her, so after searching for four years, she and her husband found a property a short drive from the Village of Southampton. It abuts 65 acres of conservation land to the west that provided additional privacy. Their 10-acre property, which includes two ponds and a 5,500-square-foot Colonial, is for sale for $9.75 million with Corcoran. Additional buildable land, for a total of 22-acres, can be purchased for $18.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sticking with traditional styles and estate designs might reflect changes in the attitudes of homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Desiderio says the financial crisis has been a "reality check" for homeowners. Ten years ago, Hampton properties were being built to flip for a profit, she says. "Today's buyer is in it for the long haul,' she says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Downside of a Recovery in Housing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news: The housing market appears to have bottomed. And the bad news? The housing market appears to have bottomed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the sector that led America into the financial crisis five years ago -- followed closely by the rest of the world -- the recent recovery in home prices comes as a relief. But the growing clamor for more quantitative easing shows that the U.S. and global economies aren't out of the woods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, one stumbling block to such bond buying is a potential uptick in inflation measures, of which housing is a big component.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report on the consumer-price index is seen showing year-over-year growth of 1.7%, the same as in May and June. But shelter costs, which make up 31.5% of the index, have outpaced the headline figure recently. Shelter costs were "outright deflating in 2010 -- it's an absolutely enormous swing over that time period," says Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices haven't fed directly into CPI since a statistical tweak in 1983. Instead, shelter costs relate largely to "owners' equivalent rent," a number based on what homeowners would pay to rent their own property, as well as actual rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shelter costs rose by 2.2% in June but <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, a real estate website, says rents in its own survey rose a much higher 5.4%. Housing may therefore start to drag the index higher in coming months as rising home prices and rents feed through to the survey. Mr. Porcelli is sanguine though -- as long as there isn't an accompanying surge in broad energy prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That factor [housing] alone is not enough to usher in an inflationary impulse," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With CPI near the slowest yearly pace since early 2011, down from 3.9% last September, the index is far from the danger zone. And, perhaps just as important, a housing-induced spike in the headline CPI number probably wouldn't spook policy makers. In a January news conference, <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> chief Ben Bernanke derided statistics such as owners' equivalent rent as "essentially made up numbers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing recovery could well wreak havoc with inflation numbers but it will only dissuade the Fed from easing if it helps spark a broader economic recovery. And that, of course, really would be good news.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doubling Down Downtown</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An investment firm that has been targeting distressed Manhattan property is pumping more money into an ailing Lower Manhattan office building that it first got involved with two years ago, according to a person who has been briefed on the situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, Savanna became a part owner of the building at 2 Rector St. when it helped landlord Stellar Management restructure a loan. The building at the time couldn't make debt payments because it had lost its largest tenant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But leasing appears to have been slower than anticipated when Savanna came to the rescue. By July, a $2.8 million pool of money set aside to cover debt payments until the building found more tenants had run dry, according to loan research service <span class="companylink">Trepp LLC</span>. The building's mortgage was sent to a firm that oversees distressed commercial property -- a special servicer -- last week, according to Fitch Ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, a Savanna-led real-estate fund is putting additional money into the property, recapitalizing the 480,000-square-foot building once again to avoid a default, according to a person briefed on the status of the building. Stellar, controlled by Larry Gluck, is staying in as manager and part-owner, although the specific terms of the deal and the amount Savanna is injecting couldn't be determined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downtown building ran into trouble after New York City's Department of Transportation left when its lease expired in 2009, leaving the building unable to generate enough money to cover debt service on its $110 million mortgage, according to Trepp. After Savanna first came in and the loan was restructured, the owners brought up the vacancy rate to 81% at the end of 2011, up from 74% a year earlier, which still left the building unable to cover its debt payments, according to Trepp.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good News, Bad News</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug Linde, the chief executive of office building giant <span class="companylink">Boston Properties</span>, cited a number of positive trends in the New York market last week when he addressed analysts and investors on a conference call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and technology companies are increasingly driving demand in the New York office market, he pointed out. For these companies "finding capable talent . . . has become critical," he noted. New York "has become a great place to find employees" because of its high quality of life "especially for a young workforce," Mr. Linde said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are also some trends hurting landlords. "We are seeing businesses become much more efficient users of office space," Mr. Linde said. Employers aren't necessarily cutting staff "but as leases expire, professional service and financial firms are downsizing their footprints," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"And the market is getting additional supply, which obviously is serving to dampen any recovery," Mr. Linde said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the call last week, <span class="companylink">Boston Properties</span> also released more details about its deal to let CBS out of its lease at the General Motors Building, which <span class="companylink">Boston Properties</span> owns and where the network had its Morning Show studio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Linde said CBS wanted to get out of its lease. As of July 1, its lease obligation for the 39,000 square feet through the middle of 2015 was $39 million. The network paid $28 million, or 71%, of that obligation, to get out of the lease, <span class="companylink">Boston Properties</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We just basically fast-forwarded the rental obligation and we did this because we made the determination that controlling the space and then trying to lease it put us in a better position . . . than going out and looking for a tenant and trying to work out a termination deal with CBS," Mr. Linde said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appetite for Space</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Muss Development Co</span>. is continuing to take strides in attracting restaurants and other retail tenants to space in downtown Brooklyn that languished for years as municipal government offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Muss has signed a 2,500-square-foot lease with Potbelly Sandwich Shop for the popular lunch joint's first Brooklyn location. Also, Bright Horizons Family Solutions, a child-care facility that also has a location in Williamsburg, has taken 15,000 square feet in property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Muss, which purchased the space at 345 Adams St. in 2007, last year said it had attracted Sugar and Plumm, a candy emporium, and American BBQ and Beer Co., a new restaurant by Las Vegas developer Mark Advent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Muss Development Co</span>., which spent millions of dollars on renovations, has been capitalizing on Downtown Brooklyn's growing restaurant scene. The real estate developer also is now looking to fill the space next door formerly occupied by a Morton's steakhouse.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Nearly three in five U.S. banks surveyed by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> this summer said demand for loans to buy homes is growing as the housing market stabilizes and mortgage rates fall to new lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But despite the increase in mortgage demand, lenders were keeping standards tight for mortgage borrowers, as well as for small-businesses loans, the Fed said this week in its quarterly survey of bank loan officers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report found a significant pickup in demand from mortgage borrowers, with 57% of banks reporting an increase in demand for home-purchase loans in the three-month period, compared with 38% in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the housing market remains shaky after a collapse in prices that started around six years ago, more experts are saying the worst days of the bust appear to be over. The pickup in loan demand shows that "a gradual housing sector recovery is in place and will increasingly be evident across measures of housing starts, sales and prices," wrote Peter Newland, an economist with <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>, in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey found that banks' credit standards aren't getting much easier for mortgage borrowers or small businesses. Among the loan officers surveyed, 93% said standards for approving mortgages to borrowers with strong credit were unchanged from the prior quarter, and 95% said standards were unchanged for firms with less than $50 million in annual sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers who qualify for loans are able to take advantage of extremely low rates. Average rates on 30-year-fixed mortgages have been below 4% since March and fell to around 3.5% last month, according to mortgage finance company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Rates could fall even lower if the Fed takes further steps to prop up the economy later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the report, loan terms eased for medium and large companies, as well as for commercial real estate deals, auto loans and credit cards -- a positive sign for the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Improving credit conditions continue to be one of the few bright spots of the economic recovery," wrote Millan Mulraine, analyst at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span>, in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed surveyed 64 domestic lenders and 23 U.S. branches of foreign banks between July 3 and July 17.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks have been cautious about implementing the Home Affordable Refinance Program, an Obama administration effort to spur refinancing, the survey said. Most banks have limited their participation to loans they already hold. A majority of banks said they were receiving more refinancing applications than they could process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey found Europe's debt woes kept U.S. banks tightening credit to European banks and other businesses. U.S. banks have benefited from the trouble abroad with less competition from European banks.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>979 words</div><div>8 August 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose by their largest percentage in at least seven years during the second quarter, propelled by low inventories of properties for sale and high demand for bargain-priced foreclosures, according to two reports Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices rose by 2.5% in June from a year ago, and by 6% from the previous quarter, said <span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span>., a Santa Ana, Calif., data firm. The quarterly jump was the largest since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which uses a different methodology, said home prices during the second quarter jumped by 4.8% from the previous quarter. That was the largest jump since 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home values helped lift Freddie to a $3 billion profit, its best showing since the mortgage-finance company was taken over by the U.S. government four years ago. Freddie's larger sibling, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, which hasn't yet reported second-quarter earnings, posted a $2.7 billion gain for the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main force behind the home-price gains appears to be a shortage of homes for sale. The number of properties on the market is down sharply from a year ago. Meanwhile, demand is up, as mortgage rates have dropped to their lowest levels in at least 60 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are rising because "there's not enough supply, given higher levels of demand," said Ivy Zelman, chief executive of Zelman &amp; Associates, a research firm. Last week, Ms. Zelman revised her 2012 price forecast to a 5% gain. At the beginning of the year, she predicted a 1% decline. "With every passing month, distressed homes are being absorbed at better and better prices," she wrote recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories are low for a handful of reasons. Investors who are scooping up homes have been converting them into rentals rather than flipping them, keeping the properties off the market. Banks have slowed their foreclosure processes in the past two years after they were found to be rushing through incomplete paperwork to repossess homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction has been at depressed levels for years, as builders have had to fend off competition from bank-owned foreclosures. That lack of new construction "has set the foundation for a snapback in pricing," said Michael Sklarz, president of Collateral Analytics, a Honolulu-based research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many traditional sellers are sitting on the sidelines because they are unable or unwilling to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 11 million homeowners owe more on their mortgages than their properties are worth, meaning they are likely to sell only if they have to move. Others who have equity could be holding out for higher prices down the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In hard-hit markets, "only a little bit of the market is tradable because you have so much negative equity," said Stan Humphries, chief economist at real-estate firm <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>. "You have very few people willing to sell homes, and a big uptick in demand can create some real price appreciation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, as inventories have shrunk, demand has picked up. "Everything is going to multiple offers," said Anthony Lamacchia, who owns a real-estate firm in Waltham, Mass. One of his agents has written 15 offers for four different buyers this summer, failing to land a property each time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lou Barnes, a mortgage banker in Boulder, Colo., said demand for mortgages to buy homes is even outpacing the levels seen during 2009 and 2010, when federal home-buyer tax credits spurred a burst of sales. "Main Street morale has brightened a great deal here," he said. "Sellers have lost their fear of giving away a house. Buyers have lost their fear of doing something dumb."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> said Monday demand for mortgages to purchase homes jumped during the second quarter by the largest amount in at least three years, according to a survey of bank lending officers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, price increases appear to be broad-based. <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> said 71 of the nation's top 100 metropolitan areas saw prices rise on a year-over-year basis in May, compared with just 19 markets in December. That was the largest number of rising metro areas since November 2006, when home prices began to tumble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jump in home prices is particularly notable at the low end of the market, fueled by investors making all-cash offers for foreclosures that can be rented out. Such rising prices allowed <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> to set aside less cash in reserve for loan losses. The company lost 38 cents for every $1 of debt that went through foreclosure during the second quarter, an improvement from 40 cents at the end of March and 42 cents a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That dynamic was evident in hard-hit markets such as Phoenix that this year have notched price gains. In Arizona, Freddie lost 40 cents for every $1 that it foreclosed on, compared with 51 cents a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing markets still face challenges. Many aspiring homeowners can't qualify for a mortgage because lending standards have tightened, with banks scrutinizing borrowers' income and assets or potential snags that might later require them to buy the loan back from Fannie or Freddie, were the borrower to default. Others simply have too much debt to take on a home purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another serious concern is the "shadow supply" of more than three million properties with mortgages in some stage of foreclosure or serious delinquency that haven't been taken back by lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, for example, said it still had $118 billion in delinquent mortgages, just below its peak of six months ago. "All the metrics are getting better, but the nonperforming inventory is still very large," said Jim Vogel, an analyst at FTN Financial. As a result, he added, "we wouldn't tell anybody that the corner has been turned yet."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson </div><div>940 words</div><div>8 August 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of the country's largest mall developers are playing a game of chicken in Missouri that illustrates how hungry they are for new projects in the burgeoning outlet-center business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Simon Property Group Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Taubman Centers Inc</span>. both are racing to prepare construction sites and to sign retailers for rival outlet malls to be built along a three-mile stretch of Interstate 64 in the small, affluent suburb of Chesterfield, near St. Louis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The region doesn't have an outlet mall and most likely could support one, retail experts say. But not necessarily two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Look, I think it's crazy for both of those outlet centers to be built," said Stephen Lebovitz, president and chief executive of <span class="companylink">CBL &amp; Associates Properties Inc</span>., which owns the traditional, full-price Chesterfield Mall a few miles away from the proposed outlet sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't unusual in the mall business for two developers to propose competing projects in areas that can't support them both. But in the past, such standoffs were resolved by one rival scrapping its plans after it fell too far behind in construction or leasing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the St. Louis race, both Taubman and Simon show no signs of wavering. Simon in June issued a statement outlining its plans for a 350,000-square-foot St. Louis Premium Outlets just east of the Missouri River on I-64. Its tenants would include <span class="companylink">Saks Fifth Avenue</span> Off 5th, <span class="companylink">Haggar Clothing Co</span>. and Hilfiger Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taubman senior vice president of development Stephen Kieras said that Taubman's nearby 450,000-square-foot Prestige Outlets Chesterfield is six months ahead of Simon's pace. But others said the gap may be as narrow as two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After decades of overbuilding of traditional malls, strip centers and big-box centers developers are rushing to build outlet centers as one of the few relatively unexploited retail-development opportunities in the U.S. In addition, outlets have become more lucrative than traditional malls as more retailers and manufacturers clamor to get into the space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail construction as a whole in the top 54 U.S. markets has declined to an estimated 21 million square feet this year, from more than 159 million in 2007, according to CoStar Group. Outlet-mall development, meanwhile, has more than tripled its 2007 output to an estimated 1.85 million square feet this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it isn't clear how much more outlet development the U.S. can handle. Some developers say the U.S. can absorb another 100 outlet centers in addition to the roughly 150 already open. Others, even Mr. Simon, consider the saturation point to be less than that. "There is room easily for the next 25," said Cedrik Lachance, an analyst tracking retail-property owners for Green Street Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there might not be room for two in St. Louis. The metro area is home to nearly three million people, and St. Louis County's median household income is slightly above the national average. The area's retail vacancy rate of 8% is slightly higher than the national average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Taubman and Simon say they have the necessary government approvals and have begun work on their sites. Just as important, both say retailers have "committed" to occupy more than half the square footage that they each intend to build.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simon has pledged a fall 2013 opening. Taubman has pinpointed its ribbon cutting even more precisely: Oct. 24, 2013. The two companies often have locked horns over rival mall projects from Long Island to California, and there is also bad blood between the two since Simon made a failed hostile-takeover bid for Taubman in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some say both malls may succeed. "It is possible, having two, that you do create an outlet Mecca," said Robert Taubman, Taubman's chairman and chief executive, on a July 27 quarterly call with investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the company also acknowledges that the competition may hurt. "I think perhaps it's more likely that it would fragment the market somewhat, that it would reduce sales productivity at the two," Mr. Taubman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives at Simon, the largest outlet-mall owner with 60 U.S. properties, declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some retailers don't expect both to be built. Each developer claims dozens of retailers who have committed to their project. However, those ranks are padded with several retailers that signed up for both projects but only intend to open a store in whichever prevails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among those that acknowledged that strategy are <span class="companylink">Hot Topic Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Maidenform Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Brown Shoe Co</span>., parent of Naturalizer and Famous Footwear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are in preliminary evaluation on both and will likely choose one," said Chris Vieth, Maidenform's chief operating officer. "We will likely not choose both."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year in the Houston area there was a similar standoff involving three developers racing to build outlet centers. In the end, two of the developers -- Simon and <span class="companylink">Tanger Factory Outlet Centers Inc</span>. -- joined forces to build a single outlet center and Taubman scrapped its plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some say the St. Louis battle between Simon and Taubman may end in a similar fashion. "You have two tremendously capable developers going after [a market that] seemingly has room for just one project," Green Street's Mr. Lachance said. "Until there is steel out of the ground, there is time for someone to back away."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Vipal Monga </div><div>773 words</div><div>7 August 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faced with limited investment opportunities as the global economy slows, a growing number of companies are weighing changing their entire corporate structure to become real-estate investment trusts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By becoming REITs -- corporations engaged mainly in owning and operating real estate -- they can return excess cash to shareholders, while avoiding federal income taxes, and get a chance to boost their stock market valuations, which has led some investors to push for the change. Also helping the trend: a broader definition by the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> of the types of assets that qualify for REIT conversion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conversion process can be complex, expensive and time consuming. For example, <span class="companylink">Iron Mountain Inc</span>. expects it will take 18 months and roughly $375 million for it to make the switch by Jan. 1, 2014. The data-storage company, which operates 64 million square feet of real estate, expects to distribute between $1 billion and $1.5 billion to shareholders as part of the conversion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the companies currently considering a switch are data-center operator <span class="companylink">Equinix Inc</span>. and prison operator <span class="companylink">Corrections Corporation of America</span>. <span class="companylink">Gaylord Entertainment Co</span>., which owns and operates conference resorts, said in May that it will make the conversion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, <span class="companylink">Iron Mountain</span>'s board approved a plan to pursue a conversion to a REIT. That decision came about 15 months after one of the company's shareholders, hedge-fund manager Elliott Management Corp., began agitating it to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Reese, <span class="companylink">Iron Mountain</span>'s chief executive, said the decision followed a yearlong study that concluded it was no longer a growth company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We will have more excess cash flow than reinvestment opportunities," at the stage the company is in now, Mr. Reese said in an interview. Stephen Golden, vice president of investor relations, said <span class="companylink">Iron Mountain</span> had $663.5 million of cash flow from continuing operations last year and invested $209.1 million on capital expenditures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs don't pay corporate income tax on any earnings distributed to shareholders, as long as those distributions total at least 90% of earnings. Shareholders pay regular income taxes on those dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have shown an appetite for the trusts. According to Dealogic, equity REITs, which invest in physical properties, have raised $12.1 billion this year as of Aug. 3. That's on pace to beat the $16.3 billion raised last year, and slightly below the $20.1 billion raised in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares in REITs have also performed well, which has encouraged firms that want to boost their share price to pursue conversion, according to tax expert Robert Willens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts</span>, U.S. equity REIT shares returned 17.9% through Aug. 3 this year, compared with the S&amp;P 500's 12% return. Last year, equity REITs returned 8.3%, compared with 2.1% for the broader stock index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason for increased interest is that the IRS has broadened assets that can qualify for REIT status, Mr. Willens said. The IRS recently ruled that billboards could be considered real-estate assets and has over the past few years also deemed solar panels and shelving units as acceptable property for REIT conversion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The IRS said in a statement that it has used the same standards to identify qualifying assets for many years. "Sometimes newly developed assets meet those standards, but the approval of specific assets in new cases should not be confused with a relaxation of the standards themselves."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the appeal, few will be able to comply with the stringent conversion requirements, said Reuben Daniels, managing partner of EA Markets, an investment bank that is advising <span class="companylink">Iron Mountain</span> on its conversion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under U.S. rules, companies are only eligible to become REITs if at least 75% of their assets and 75% of their gross income comes from owning and operating real estate. That means companies may need to make changes to meet that standard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gaylord Entertainment, for example, will sell its brand and management operations to <span class="companylink">Marriott International Inc</span>. before converting to a REIT.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making the switch took Weyerhaeuser Corp. 18 months, said Patricia Bedient, the timber company's chief financial officer. <span class="companylink">Weyerhaeuser</span> became a REIT in 2010. It had to go through more than 100 years of tax filings to calculate how much it had earned since its founding in 1900. It then distributed $5.6 billion to shareholders in cash and stock before becoming a REIT.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Alessia Pirolo </div><div>776 words</div><div>6 August 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A18</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first glance, 1590 Second Ave. would seem like a strange location for a new Irish gastro pub. The building between 82nd and 83rd streets is in the middle of the congestion and confusion accompanying the construction of the Second Avenue subway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for Ruairi Curtin there was a compelling reason to open his new pub Penrose there in June: The price was right. Retail rents in the area have dropped 30% to 40% since construction began on the new subway line in 2007, according to area real-estate companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The low rents made the location "a good deal for us," says Mr. Curtin, 35 years old, who has opened four other bars in New York since he moved here from Cork, Ireland, 13 years ago. He declined to specify what he's paying in the 12-year lease, but he said the landlord agreed to a reduction of about 20% for the next four years of construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building of the subway, which isn't scheduled to end until 2016, has been a migraine for most Second Avenue residents, store owners and landlords. But it is lured some newcomers to the area by driving down retail rents to about $80 per square foot, compared with about $125 in 2007, according to Jill Lovatt, director of retail leasing for Massey Knakal Realty Services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another deal, the DashLocker, a high-tech laundry service opened in June at 1566 Second Ave., between 81st and 82nd streets. The rent in that deal was in the high $80-to-$90 a square foot range, according to people involved in the transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the kosher gourmet-food shop, Prime Butcher Baker, opened last February at 1572 Second Ave. between 81st and 82nd streets in a 2,000-square-foot space. "The rent was very attractive," says the owner Joey Allaham, who brings in business by offering the store as a private restaurant for groups. "When we signed the lease, the construction was taken into consideration."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, many landlords and retailers in the area are still struggling with the dust, noise and construction barricades. There are six vacant stores along the corridor between 79th and 86th streets, according to Jay Gilbert, an associated director at Newmark Grubb Knight Frank Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lovatt, of Massey Knakal, estimates a vacancy rate of 25% on the stretch between 72nd and 96th streets. For example, an 800-square-foot store between 82nd and 83rd streets has been vacant for over one year, despite the reduction of asking rent from $10,000 to $6,000 a month, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there is interest in the location, some potential tenants "look outside at the street and they say, 'we can't do this,'" Ms. Lovatt says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is some hope among Second Avenue denizens that the low rents will help to make the Upper East Side cool again. The once trendy area has been eclipsed by other neighborhoods like the Meat Packing District and NoHo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, Penrose is doing well. On a recent Tuesday night, its wood-and-brick main room was packed with 30-somethings still in their work clothes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brad LaConte, a 35-year-old West Village resident sipping a beer while sitting on a vintage bar stool, said a friend told him it was the latest hot spot in the area. The main difference between the Penrose and the Lower Manhattan hangouts that he frequents was "that here there are baby strollers in the back," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upper East Side business owners also are hoping that Second Avenue gets a boost when a new place opens to replace Elaine's, the much-loved restaurant that was located at Second Avenue and 88th Street for about 40 years, before it shut its doors in May 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Glick, the owner of the Parlor Steakhouse on Third Avenue, has leased the 3,500-square-foot space, and he says he plans to open a "casual fine dining" restaurant "probably in January." The interiors, which were featured in Woody Allen's "Manhattan" among other movies, will be completely renovated, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retailers and landlords also are hoping that if they can tough it out through the construction period, the neighborhood will boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason Pruger, an executive managing director of Newmark, predicts that retail rents will increase 20% from their peak once the first phase of the subway, from 96th Street to 63rd Street, opens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Private money always follows public money," he says. "Look at the High Line."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For investors, "home" is no longer a four-letter word.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate sector, for the first time in years, is serving as a beacon of relative strength in an otherwise weak economy. <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> on Tuesday reported that home prices in its S&amp;P/Case-Shiller 20-city index rose 0.9% in May from the prior month, after adjusting for seasonal trends, and have risen 2.6% since bottoming in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the world's smartest investors, including Warren Buffett, are taking notice, placing big bets on a continued recovery in the housing market. Other kinds of real-estate investments -- including real-estate investment trusts that own shopping malls, apartment buildings and hospitals -- also have been among the best performers this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For ordinary investors, the rebound serves as an opportunity to rethink how much of their portfolio should be in real-estate investments -- and to participate in the rebirth of a sector they once left for dead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"After the recent returns we've seen, people are naturally asking 'Have I already missed it or is there further upside to come?' From our perspective, yes, there's further upside," says Frank Haggerty, a portfolio manager at money manager <span class="companylink">Duff &amp; Phelps Investment Management</span> who comanages a $1.3 billion mutual fund that invests in commercial-real-estate companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is reason for optimism. Not only are single-family home prices steadily climbing, but the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University in a June report said inventories of new, single-family homes in March were at the lowest level in 49 years. The upshot: It would take fewer than six months to sell the current inventory, the traditional boundary between a strong and weak market, says Eric Belsky, managing director of the center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, some promising signals during the recession turned out to be false alarms. In mid-2009, the 20-city S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index began a yearlong rise, only to fall again. Yale professor Robert Shiller, who called both the early 2000s stock-market crash and the recent real-estate bust, says he isn't certain prices have bottomed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even if the absolute nadir hasn't been reached, most economists say the odds are good that real estate will be stronger over the next few years than it has been in the past few.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, experts say that because commercial real estate is such a big part of the economy, it should make up about 15% or more of the stock portion of an investment portfolio. Yet these days, commercial real estate comprises only about 3% of funds that track the broad stock market -- meaning investors who follow the major indexes are drastically underexposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With that in mind, here is how to play the real estate turnaround smartly in three main ways -- investing in home builders, buying real-estate investment trusts and buying and managing individual properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least some of the real-estate recovery already has been priced into the market, experts say. The iShares Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction exchange-traded fund has returned 35% this year including dividends, according to investment-research firm Morningstar, trouncing the S&amp;P 500's jump by 25 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even with the increase, housing stocks are still 66% below their May 2006 level, when the housing crisis was just getting started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is reason to believe some home builders have more room to run, says Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at <span class="companylink">Janney Montgomery Scott</span>. While valuations might look rich at first glance, the numbers are skewed, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors commonly value home builders by looking at the ratio of their share prices to their book value, a measure known as the price/book multiple. But those ratios look artificially high because builders' land and other assets are just starting to reflect the recovery, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ratio "is distorted," he says. "Even without making heroic assumptions on new-home sales, there's room for home builders to go up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason to be bullish: On average, after home prices reach their trough, upturns last seven years, according to a study by the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> of 55 housing rebounds world-wide since the 1970s. So, if a bottom has in fact been reached, home construction companies could be in for another 6 1/2 years of increasing sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The easiest way to make a broad bet on home builders is through an ETF, such as SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders or iShares Dow Jones US Home Construction. Given the market's run-up, however, it might be smarter to stick with specific home-related stocks that have the most room for growth, says Bob Wetenhall, a senior analyst at <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KB Homes, for example, has shown improving new-home orders that set it above other home builders, Mr. Wetenhall says. What's more, after accounting for tax benefits that it accrued during the housing downturn, the company's price/book ratio is 1, about 30% below that of other home builders, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar, which has a price/book ratio of 1.5 after adjusting for tax benefits, looks expensive next to its peers. But since it gets revenues not only from single-family homes but also multifamily housing and other kinds of real estate, it will be buttressed, Mr. Wetenhall says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although single-family housing made the headlines during the real-estate boom, the performance of real-estate investment trusts -- which mostly manage portfolios of commercial properties such as office parks, malls and apartment buildings -- was also spectacular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts</span> index of publicly traded REITs nearly tripled between January 2003 and the index's peak in January 2007, including dividends -- making large-company stocks' total return of 62% look paltry by comparison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then equity REITs, which primarily own real estate rather than mortgages, were crushed during the downturn, losing more than two-thirds of their value from their 2007 high. But equity REITs have risen 15% this year and now are about even with their peak, after dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many financial advisers argue that since REITs already make up about 3% of funds that track total stock-market indexes, they don't deserve a separate allocation in a portfolio. Others say REITs should get up to 20% of the overall pie because of their low correlations with other asset classes and high dividend yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The right answer is in between.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last decade, REITs increasingly have moved in lock-step with the broader stock market, according to a Morningstar analysis, meaning their low-correlation benefits are nearly gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And since the 1970s, REITs' dividends have also grown more slowly than inflation, knocking down that benefit, says money manager William Bernstein, author of "The Investor's Manifesto."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But investors should put a hefty chunk of their portfolio in REITs, says Rick Ferri, founder of investment adviser Portfolio Solutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason? Most commercial real estate isn't publicly traded, so broad stock-market funds grossly understate the sector's importance to the economy, Mr. Ferri says. To make up the difference, investors should invest an extra 10% of their stock allocation in equity REITs -- which would turn a hypothetical 60/40 portfolio into one with 54% in a total stock-market fund, 6% in a REIT index fund, and 40% in a total bond-market fund, Mr. Ferri says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warning: Don't confuse equity REITs with mortgage REITs, which use short-term debt to buy long-term mortgage-backed securities and are more of a bet on interest-rate and credit-quality trends than real-estate performance, says Mr. Bernstein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The easiest way to capture equity REIT exposure is with a low-cost index fund, like the Vanguard REIT ETF, which has an expense ratio of 0.10%, dividend yield of 3.3%, and has returned about 17% this year, including dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding bargains among specific REITs might be more difficult, given the recent rally. Experts suggest starting with valuation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than use a price/earnings ratio to value real-estate investment trusts, many REIT investors calculate a price/funds-from-operations ratio, which excludes depreciation and amortization -- both hefty expenses for heavy property owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on that measure, the valuations of REITs in some sectors already are approaching their 2007 heights. REITs that own industrial properties, for example, had a forward P/FFO multiple of about 15.4, according to Nareit, the same level as in January 2007. And REITs that own regional malls have a P/FFO of 15.4, above 2007's 13.7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the plus side, apartment REITs' multiple of 17.2 is still well below the 19.6 level seen in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs that will benefit most from an economic turnaround will be those with shorter lease terms that can quickly raise rents, says Mr. Haggerty of Duff &amp; Phelps, making those that own hotels, apartments and storage units the strongest players. High-quality mall properties also will fare better in a slowly expanding economy, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, as of the end of May, Mr. Haggerty's fund had positions in self-storage REIT Extra Space Storage and apartment REIT <span class="companylink">Essex Property Trust</span>. The fund also had holdings in mall owner <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group</span> and regional-mall REIT Taubman Centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although home builders and REITs have risen in anticipation of the real estate turnaround, the prices of single-family homes have barely begun to increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To value single-family homes, some investors divide average home prices, as measured by an index such as that run by S&amp;P/Case-Shiller, by "owners' equivalent rent," which is calculated by the <span class="companylink">Bureau of Labor Statistics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By that measure, home valuations are almost as low as they were in the first quarter of 1998, well before the most recent real-estate run-up began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has caught the attention of many investors, including Mr. Buffett, who in February said he would buy "a couple hundred thousand" homes if it were practical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Mr. Buffett has said he plans to bid on the loan portfolio of failed mortgage lender Residential Capital and also has profited from gains at some of <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway</span>'s home-related subsidiaries, including paint maker Benjamin Moore and modular-home builder <span class="companylink">Clayton Homes</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller investors could benefit from the trend as well, experts say, by directly buying properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, renting out homes and apartments can be tricky. Investment property owners have to deal with problems ranging from prolonged vacancies to deadbeat tenants. They also might underestimate maintenance and insurance expenses and overestimate rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash buyers often are favored by sellers and might even command a better price. But banks are willing to lend for investment properties as long as the investor can make at least a 30% down payment on the home, says Bankrate.com senior financial analyst Greg McBride.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For investors who aren't keen on dealing with such obstacles but want exposure to single-family housing, an alternative is coming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts</span> and home builder <span class="companylink">Beazer Homes</span> announced plans to soon go public with a REIT that will own and rent single-family homes. Other private-equity firms have announced similar intentions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's great opportunity in actually buying residential homes directly for investors who have the capital," Mr. Luschini says. "Prices are clearly turning the corner, and housing affordability is the highest in a generation."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For investors, "home" is no longer a four-letter word.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate sector, for the first time in years, is serving as a beacon of relative strength in an otherwise weak economy. <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> on Tuesday reported that home prices in its S&amp;P/Case-Shiller 20-city index rose 0.9% in May from the prior month, after adjusting for seasonal trends, and have risen 2.6% since bottoming in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the world's smartest investors, including Warren Buffett, are taking notice, placing big bets on a continued recovery in the housing market. Other kinds of real-estate investments—including real-estate investment trusts that own shopping malls, apartment buildings and hospitals—also have been among the best performers this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For ordinary investors, the rebound serves as an opportunity to rethink how much of their portfolio should be in real-estate investments—and to participate in the rebirth of a sector they once left for dead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"After the recent returns we've seen, people are naturally asking 'Have I already missed it or is there further upside to come?' From our perspective, yes, there's further upside," says Frank Haggerty, a portfolio manager at money manager <span class="companylink">Duff &amp; Phelps Investment Management</span> who comanages a $1.3 billion mutual fund that invests in commercial-real-estate companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is reason for optimism. Not only are single-family home prices steadily climbing, but the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University in a June report said inventories of new, single-family homes in March were at the lowest level in 49 years. The upshot: It would take fewer than six months to sell the current inventory, the traditional boundary between a strong and weak market, says Eric Belsky, managing director of the center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, some promising signals during the recession turned out to be false alarms. In mid-2009, the 20-city S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index began a yearlong rise, only to fall again. Yale professor Robert Shiller, who called both the early 2000s stock-market crash and the recent real-estate bust, says he isn't certain prices have bottomed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even if the absolute nadir hasn't been reached, most economists say the odds are good that real estate will be stronger over the next few years than it has been in the past few.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, experts say that because commercial real estate is such</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">a big part of the economy, it should make up about 15% or more of the stock portion of an investment portfolio. Yet these days, commercial real estate comprises only about 3% of funds that track the broad stock market—meaning investors who follow the major indexes are drastically underexposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With that in mind, here is how to play the real estate turnaround smartly in three main ways—investing in home builders, buying real-estate investment trusts and buying and managing individual properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Picking the Best Builders</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least some of the real-estate recovery already has been priced into the market, experts say. The iShares Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction exchange-traded fund has returned 35% this year including dividends, according to investment-research firm Morningstar, trouncing the S&amp;P 500's jump by 25 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even with the increase, housing stocks are still 66% below their May 2006 level, when the housing crisis was just getting started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is reason to believe some home builders have more room to run, says Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at <span class="companylink">Janney Montgomery Scott</span>. While valuations might look rich at first glance, the numbers are skewed, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors commonly value home builders by looking at the ratio of their share prices to their book value, a measure known as the price/book multiple. But those ratios look artificially high because builders' land and other assets are just starting to reflect the recovery, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ratio "is distorted," he says. "Even without making heroic assumptions on new-home sales, there's room for home builders to go up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason to be bullish: On average, after home prices reach their trough, upturns last seven years, according to a study by the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> of 55 housing rebounds world-wide since the 1970s. So, if a bottom has in fact been reached, home construction companies could be in for another 6½ years of increasing sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The easiest way to make a broad bet on home builders is through an ETF, such as SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders or iShares Dow Jones US Home Construction. Given the market's run-up, however, it might be smarter to stick with specific home-related stocks that have the most room for growth, says Bob Wetenhall, a senior analyst at <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KB Homes, for example, has shown improving new-home orders that set it above other home builders, Mr. Wetenhall says. What's more, after accounting for tax benefits that it accrued during the housing downturn, the company's price/book ratio is 1, about 30% below that of other home builders, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar, which has a price/book ratio of 1.5 after adjusting for tax benefits, looks expensive next to its peers. But since it gets revenues not only from single-family homes but also multifamily housing and other kinds of real estate, it will be buttressed, Mr. Wetenhall says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rethinking REITs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although single-family housing made the headlines during the real-estate boom, the performance of real-estate investment trusts—which mostly manage portfolios of commercial properties such as office parks, malls and apartment buildings—was also spectacular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts</span> index of publicly traded REITs nearly tripled between January 2003 and the index's peak in January 2007, including dividends—making large-company stocks' total return of 62% look paltry by comparison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then equity REITs, which primarily own real estate rather than mortgages, were crushed during the downturn, losing more than two-thirds of their value from their 2007 high. But equity REITs have risen 15% this year and now are about even with their peak, after dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many financial advisers argue that since REITs already make up about 3% of funds that track total stock-market indexes, they don't deserve a separate allocation in a portfolio. Others say REITs should get up to 20% of the overall pie because of their low correlations with other asset classes and high dividend yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The right answer is in between.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last decade, REITs increasingly have moved in lock-step with the broader stock market, according to a Morningstar analysis, meaning their low-correlation benefits are nearly gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And since the 1970s, REITs' dividends have also grown more slowly than inflation, knocking down that benefit, says money manager William Bernstein, author of "The Investor's Manifesto."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But investors should put a hefty chunk of their portfolio in REITs, says Rick Ferri, founder of investment adviser Portfolio Solutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason? Most commercial real estate isn't publicly traded, so broad stock-market funds grossly understate the sector's importance to the economy, Mr. Ferri says. To make up the difference, investors should invest an extra 10% of their stock allocation in equity REITs—-which would turn a hypothetical 60/40 portfolio into one with 54% in a total stock-market fund, 6% in a REIT index fund, and 40% in a total bond-market fund, Mr. Ferri says.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warren Buffett famously once said: "Be fearful when others are greedy, be greedy when others are fearful."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if you're not instinctively scared of the housing market, then global warming, saturated fat, running with scissors and the bogeyman probably aren't keeping you awake at night, either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that everyone is scared to dabble in—much less commit to—housing makes it a close-to-perfect investment based on Mr. Buffett's principle. But buying real estate is a good long-term investment for many more reasons, some of which have only become apparent in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most striking: Housing prices rose sharply from April to May. The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Index rose 2.2% in 20 of the nation's big cities. Prices shot up more than 3% in Chicago, Atlanta, San Francisco and Minneapolis. Even Detroit's housing market scored a gain, inching up by 0.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the increase was the first in seven months. More importantly, the increase matched other data and empirical evidence this spring that foreclosures slowed and inventories were shrinking. Simple economics suggests that as the supply of distressed property slows, buyers will be forced into higher-price properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, interest rates on 30-year fixed mortgages have tumbled below 3.5%. For those who can get credit, these aren't just historically low rates; they are one-sided deals tilted toward borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other good signs: Housing starts rose 6.9% in June. Home-building stocks are on the rise, with the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index up 27% so far this year. And for those who can invest in property, rents continue their ascent. Prices are at a 10-year high, with the median unit renting for $710 a month. Real-estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> found that it is cheaper to buy than rent in each of the nation's 100 biggest metropolitan areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, if you can buy a home today, you can save the difference it would cost you to rent even if you stay in the home just five years. If you can buy a property and rent it, it is almost certain that the rent will cover the cost of the financing—and the property will appreciate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's where the fear comes in. From 30% to 50% of existing mortgages in the U.S. market are underwater, depending on the estimate. That means many borrowers are trapped in their homes and loans. They either can keep paying and hope prices will improve or walk away, putting downward pressure on home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosure rates have leveled off, but market analysts believe an increase is likely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's why. Since the financial crisis, 3.7 million homes have been foreclosed on, but an additional 1.4 million remain in the national foreclosure inventory, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, a housing recovery won't happen, or could be snuffed out, by a rotten economy. There's never been significant growth in housing with high unemployment. And as Dow Jones's Kathleen Madigan noted, "Potential buyers must feel secure with their job prospects before they commit to long-term mortgages. Higher loan standards mean banks want to see an applicant's solid income history before lending."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is plenty to be afraid of when it comes to home buying. But in the current investing climate, housing presents an attractive long-term investment that should hold steady or even have upside surprise in the short term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fixed-income yields have fallen to historic lows, and the stock market has traded in a range, rising and falling skittishly on jobs, growth data and the news from Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, I was forced to choose between renting and buying. I decided to buy because it offered immediate monthly savings compared to renting, not to mention a mortgage-interest deduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So this is at least one case where I'm putting my money where my keyboard is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Buffett would remind us that investments of any kind are not without risk. Each should be considered with the investor's time horizon and appetites. But he also has acknowledged that real estate is especially attractive when financing is cheap, there is pent-up demand and prices have been driven down by a spooked market. Put another way, it's time to be greedy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending rose again in June, the latest sign of improvement in the housing market. Total U.S. construction spending increased 0.4% to an $842 billion annual rate in June, up 7% from a year ago. Construction outlays were driven mostly by private residential builders, while spending on nonresidential construction such as offices barely climbed.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Dawn Wotapka </div><div>794 words</div><div>1 August 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C11</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> purchased a large number of apartment units in East Palo Alto, Calif., last year, some local leaders and housing advocates feared the multifamily giant would try to boost revenue by pushing out regulated residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, they say their fears may be coming true. Since the deal closed in December, <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> has steadily picked up the pace of rent-due notices it has sent to residents of Woodland Park, an assortment of apartments and homes with about 1,800 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing advocates say this more-aggressive strategy doesn't bode well for Woodland Park's working-class tenants who are scraping to get by. While they acknowledge that the pace of evictions hasn't increased, they are concerned it is only a matter of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It does seem, from what we've seen, as if there has been some sort of effort to step up the enforcement on rent collection," said Shirley Gibson, directing attorney of the Legal Aid Society of San Mateo County, which represents several Woodland Park residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're talking about a population of people who don't have money to pay on the first" of the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> agrees that it is sending out more late-rent notices than when it took over the properties, but executives say that is just a matter of good management. The company denies it has any strategy to push out rent-stabilized tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Woodlands is a terrific, well-located asset that fits in well with our Bay Area portfolio," said an Equity Residential spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tension is fueled by a tech boom that is drawing thousands of well-paid newcomers to Silicon Valley, allowing many rental landlords to fill units and raise rents quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Woodland Park is located about two miles from social-networking giant <span class="companylink">Facebook Inc</span>.'s headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have a lot of well-paid tech workers who are coming to the area to get jobs, and they're trying to find housing and that forces rents up in the whole market. So everyone in the market feels the pressure," said Alexander Goldfarb, a real-estate investment trust analyst with Sandler O'Neill + Partners. "It's very difficult to build in California, especially in areas like Silicon Valley, and that creates an imbalance between supply and demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span>, whose chairman is Sam Zell and is better known for owning higher-end properties, paid $130 million for Woodland Park, which had been in a foreclosure proceeding. Rents in the complex currently range between $363 and $2,445 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under East Palo Alto's rent stabilization rules, rent increases are set by a local board. Between 2012 and 2013, the increase was set at 2.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing advocates have been concerned because, under the rules, <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> is allowed to charge more-lucrative market rents when units are vacated. After that point, though, annual rent increases are still limited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> says that when units open up, the new tenant pays about 15% more than the previous resident. On its website, <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> is advertising studio apartments starting at $951 and two bedrooms from $1,635. A 1,436-square-foot house goes for $2,090 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> took over Woodland Park, complaints and concerns from tenants about eviction actions have escalated, according to Carol Lamont, administrator of the city's rent stabilization program. Ms. Lamont's office also just completed a report that says that <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> has been steadily increasing the number of notices sent to tenants who are five days late on their rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company delivered 330 such notices in June, compared with 205 in May, 84 in April and 14 in January, according to the report that was presented to East Palo Alto's interim city manager. The notices give tenants three days to pay or to move out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gibson says that the prior owners were more flexible with tenants behind on their rent and didn't immediately start the eviction process. <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> says it switched in the spring to an automated system that automatically generates notices to any tenant with overdue rent. But the company also contends that previous owner issued notices at a similar rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> has evicted 45 tenants, which is about 2.5% of units, since it took over, according to the Equity Residential spokesman. He said the company's national average is 2.3% and is 2.1% in the Bay Area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also said that when Woodland Park tenants are behind on their rent, the company works with them to avoid eviction.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi </div><div>715 words</div><div>1 August 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week's news that <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span> landed <span class="companylink">Google Inc</span>. as a tenant for the Chicago Merchandise Mart, one of the city's largest office buildings, was viewed by many as a big win for downtown Chicago. But to real-estate industry executives, the deal is also a coup that may help Vornado speed up its exit from the furniture-mart business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since late last year, Vornado, based in New York and one of the nations's biggest office and retail landlords, has surprised skeptics by whittling down its trade-show and furniture-showroom division. The company is selling a string of properties that include the Washington Design Center, <span class="companylink">Boston Design Center</span> and L.A. Mart. The separate deals, valued at a total of $228 million, have closed or are expected to close by October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, by bringing 3,000 jobs from <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s newly acquired <span class="companylink">Motorola Mobility</span> unit into the Chicago Merchandise Mart, Vornado is shoring up the property and is widely expected to put it on the block to unlock the value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's the one that really matters," said Michael Knott, a managing director at real-estate research firm Green Street Advisors, who estimates the 3.5 million-square-foot Merchandise Mart could fetch between $787 million and $875 million. "It's the big mother ship."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vornado declined to comment on a possible sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vornado burst onto the furniture trade-show scene in 1998 when it acquired the Chicago Merchandise Mart and some related assets for $630 million from Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises, the Kennedy family holding company. The sprawling terra-cotta building overlooking the Chicago River was built by retail tycoon Marshall Field and opened in 1930. In 1945, it was acquired by Joseph P. Kennedy for $13 million, and it became a national hub for the home-furnishing industry and one of the most valuable Kennedy family assets. For the next half century its rents helped fund the lives of his children and grandchildren.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, the housing crisis depressed furniture sales and showroom demand. Annual home-furnishing sales volumes hit $83 billion last year, up from a trough of $78 billion in 2009 but still below the previous peak of $94 billion in 2007, according to Jerry Epperson, a partner with financial-services company Mann, Armistead &amp; Epperson in Richmond, Va., which tracks the industry. Some showrooms became creditors as a number of tenants folded, Mr. Epperson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010 Vornado felt the pain. It gave five High Point buildings back to the special servicer overseeing the company's $191 million securitized mortgage in lieu of a foreclosure action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About the same time Vornado tried to sell the Mart business and "came close with one buyer, but no cigar," Vornado's Chairman Steven Roth wrote in his annual letter to shareholders in April. As of Dec. 31, the company's <span class="companylink">Merchandise Mart Properties</span> unit owned five properties containing 5.7 million square feet. Others saw a signal of change when Christopher Kennedy, son of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, announced last year that he was stepping down from his post as president after many years with the division.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while Vornado has acknowledged it was selling many of its mart properties, the company has hedged its bets on the storied Chicago building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his letter, Mr. Roth wrote that the company would "continue to sell down the Mart business asset by asset" as part of a broader effort to restore the company's luster. He also said the Merchandise Mart was to be retained "for now." The mart division produced only 3.7% of the $15.5 billion company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2011 while office and retail in Washington, D.C., and New York contribute the vast majority, according to the company filings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People want to see Vornado simplify," said Alexander Goldfarb, an analyst with Sandler O'Neill + Partners LP. "The exiting of the mart business is good, but they have a lot of steps to go." Over the past five years Vornado shares have fallen about 18%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Neil Shah   </div><div>675 words</div><div>31 July 2012</div><div>16:05</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans are earning more money—but socking it away and not spending, undermining hopes for a consumer-driven rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The personal saving rate, which measures savings as a percentage of disposable income, jumped to 4.4% in June from 4% a month earlier and a recent low of 3.2% in November, the government said Tuesday, as consumers squirreled away cash amid the weak economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on everything from vacations to clothes was largely flat in June. Spending fell less than 0.1%, after easing 0.1% in May, even though Americans' income after taxes rose 0.4%, the most since March. Consumer spending is the biggest single driver of the U.S. economy, accounting for roughly two-thirds of demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pickup in saving is a two-edged sword for the economy. In the long run, saving helps Americans establish a cushion against financial setbacks and build up wealth that can fuel spending. It also helps them cope with rising gasoline and food prices. But penny-pinching sucks life out of the economy, which relies heavily on consumer spending and faces a dimming outlook as other drivers of growth lose steam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is good news for the future, but it provides little help to the U.S. economy," said Eugenio Alemán, senior economist at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Securities</span>. "Individuals are hoarding cash to continue to build a protective layer in case the economy and their personal situation turns negative."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two other reports Tuesday suggested consumers could regain some of their appetite for spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index showed home prices rose 0.9% in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, the latest sign the housing market is bottoming. As home prices rise, Americans tend to feel wealthier and become more willing to spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Conference Board, a private research group, said its index of consumer confidence inched up to 65.9 in July after four straight months of declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, confidence remains at historically low levels and consumers actually became more concerned about their current conditions, the Conference Board survey showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More signs of consumer caution will likely be frustrating for <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> officials, who have attempted to kick-start the economy with unconventional measures to lower long-term interest rates in a bid to spur spending and investment. Officials are meeting this week to discuss the economic outlook and their next steps, amid growing expectations they may take more action to boost the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, economists hoped improvements in the job market, lower benchmark interest rates and falling gasoline prices at the pump might prompt consumers to spend more. If demand grew for goods and services, businesses would need to hire more workers, creating a positive feedback loop where spending sparked more hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are few signs that is happening yet. U.S. economic growth slowed to an annual rate of 1.5% in the second quarter, less than the 2% rate in the first quarter and 4.1% in the fourth. A significant drag was slower growth in consumer spending, which fell to 1.5% in the second quarter from 2.4% in the first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Danielle Carr, owner of Pansy Pie, an online store that sells handmade tutus for girls, said sales stalled in June and July. "This summer was brutal. It was 50% less than what we made last year," the 30-year-old St. Louis-based designer said. She also saw a big drop in orders from buyers at boutiques and retailers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Carr responded by shedding products that weren't selling and reaching out to more buyers. While sales are starting to pick up, she and her husband are cutting back on their own spending and working harder to make ends meet. "It's been tough sometimes to make the house payment," she said. "We always make it, but we have to really scrimp and save."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto and Ted Mann </div><div>1292 words</div><div>30 July 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost a million square feet of new Financial District retail space -- essentially the size of a suburban mall -- is being developed in what many see as a long-awaited turnaround for Lower Manhattan shopping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questions loom over the four projects, however -- are there enough shoppers to fill those stores and is there enough demand from retailers for all this space in a market that has been relatively untested for the last decade?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign of just how difficult that task is likely to be, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will turn over the responsibility for managing 70,000 square feet of new high-end retail space at Fulton Center to a private operator -- a first for the agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the Fulton Center will face stiff competition: the World Trade Center, World Financial Center, Fulton Center and South Street Seaport are all currently competing to fill hundreds of store spaces at roughly the same time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers and brokers said there is plenty of pent-up demand since the destruction of the World Trade Center and its huge underground mall on Sept. 11, 2001. Even with a daytime population of wealthy financial workers, millions of tourists and a growing residential population, Lower Manhattan has lagged well behind other busy parts of the city in terms of shopping options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faith Hope Consolo, chairman of Prudential Douglas Elliman's retail group, said it would be "difficult" to fill all of this space. But she added that it will be good for the neighborhood overall. "Downtown will finally come into its own in the next 18 months," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower Manhattan's problem isn't demand, say brokers. It is that its retail spaces traditionally haven't been enticing, thanks in part to a warren of confusing side streets and shadowy storefronts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of the new projects will include more glass, large, bright public spaces, more food and a diverse selection of retailers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers want the new shopping centers to be different from the World Trade Center mall, which was geared to financial workers, and more in the vein of Century 21, a department store that is a destination for both tourists and area residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are hoping to appeal to the area's changing worker population, which will include media company Conde Nast in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The reality for me is for so long Downtown, the office tenants consisted of investment banks and the <span class="companylink">Port Authority</span> -- really non-sexy types of tenants. Conde Nast will absolutely change that," said Jeffrey Roseman, a broker at Newmark Grubb <span class="companylink">Knight Frank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another question is the leasing of the office space at the World Trade Center, where two of the towers are only partly leased and 3 World Trade Center is stalled because the developer, Larry Silverstein, can't find a tenant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fulton Center is likely to be one of the most enticing spaces because of the high amount of foot traffic, say brokers. The MTA will issue an RFP for the retail space Aug. 2, seeking a master lessee to handle leasing and operations of the nine-level structure and the attached concourse under Dey Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $1.4 billion project is slated for completion in June 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent morning, Uday Durg, the MTA's program executive for Lower Manhattan projects, gestured through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the Fulton Center's third floor, pointing at the church steeple across Broadway to illustrate a point: This was no place for a modest food court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're sitting here having a drink," Mr. Durg said, conjuring up a future restaurant space, "and you can see St. Paul's!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Towering above commuters, lighted by the 56-foot wide oculus that is the Fulton Center's dominant feature, will be a glass-walled cube of new space for stores and cafes that MTA officials think will thrive on the constant stream of pedestrians moving through the building's lower sections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the agency seeks bidders on its RFP, it is trying to emphasize the attractiveness of the new building -- not just a kiosk in a train station -- and appeal to the neighborhood's new vibrancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't want the spaces to be dormant," said Eve Michel, the MTA's vice president of development and chief architect, as construction crews maneuvered inside the soaring atrium of the new building. "We want it to be active and dynamic space."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're trying to create a certain stickiness," she added, "so they'll stay and spend money."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with the Fulton Center, the shopping and dining center at the World Trade Center is expected to have some of the Financial District's most sought-after retail space, brokers said. <span class="companylink">The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</span> has leased the space to mall developer <span class="companylink">Westfield Group</span>, which has more than 350,000 square feet to fill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For that part of lower Manhattan, the World Trade Center is the best site -- probably one of the best sites in the world," said Peter Lowy, chief executive of Westfield Group. "Others will be going after some of the same upmarket merchants that we're going for, but the WTC is the better site by far."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westfield said the center will have five shopping levels, with typical stores of about 1,200 to 1,500 square feet and opportunities for one or two larger stores of 20,000 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the busy West Street, at the World Financial Center, <span class="companylink">Brookfield Office Properties</span> is trying to overcome the difficulty of an older building with a less prime location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brookfield is investing $250 million in gut-renovating the 1980s-era center, including the installation of more glass frontage and a 25,000-square-foot European-style market with outdoor dining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives said they would distinguish their space, in part, by drawing tourists to the water with food and capitalizing on Battery Park City's residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're creating a waterfront community that we're really looking to serve," said David Cheikin, a vice president of leasing at Brookfield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, at the South Street Seaport the <span class="companylink">Howard Hughes Corp</span>. is trying to remake a waterfront retail complex that has long struggled to draw New Yorkers, who shy away from enclosed malls. The developer is creating a glassy complex with a landscaped roof (reminiscent of the High Line) and said it would compete, in part, because it could accommodate larger stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of these developers are actively engaged in trying to lease their spaces and expect to begin announcing deals as early as this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of high-profile stores currently found on prime strips like Fifth Avenue and Times Square are now looking in Lower Manhattan, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's not a single retailer who's going to say, 'I'm not looking down there,'" said Chase Welles, an executive vice president at Northwest Atlantic Real Estate Services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, many brokers and neighborhood officials express confidence that after decades of difficulty, the Financial District may finally be able to lure shoppers away from popular strips such as SoHo and Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The handful of retailers that are in Lower Manhattan, including Century 21 and J&amp;R Electronics, are flooded with tourists and locals alike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some retail "had a tough time in the last 10 years because of the impact of construction," said Elizabeth Berger, president of the Downtown Alliance. "Many national retailers are waiting to see what happens at these centers. There will be more opportunities and interest."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan </div><div>1007 words</div><div>30 July 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A18</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A riddle: When is a hotel not just a regular hotel and when is a condo building not just an ordinary condo building?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For architect Jonathan Marvel, who is designing a long-awaited hotel-condominium project for a partnership led by <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. and Starwood Capital at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge, the answer is easy: When it is in a park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Marvel says he divides all the structures in New York City into two categories: "fabric buildings," or structures such as warehouses and brownstones that blend into their context because of design that isn't distinctive; and "iconic buildings" such as signature office towers, bridges and public buildings that are meant to be singular and require more of architects in the way of creativity, ingenuity and personality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ordinarily, a 200-room hotel and 159 condominiums spread across two buildings could easily fall into the former category. But since the buildings are to be situated inside Brooklyn Bridge Park, they can't be just another part of the urban fabric -- they have to be something more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you're designing a building in a park, you're no longer part of the fabric around you, and you're immediately thrust in the situation of being an icon, and the bar is raised super high in terms of being architecture of consequence," Mr. Marvel said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early renderings show two long, relatively low-slung residential buildings made of white limestone and glass, placed on two pieces of land near Pier 1 known as Parcel A and Parcel B. The first, and larger, is 10 stories high, and attached to its north end is the glassy, box-shaped hotel building, which wraps around the back side of the condo portion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both structures use a what Mr. Marvel calls a "step-up" design, meaning the units toward the front rise like a staircase, giving the apartments behind them views of the East River and Manhattan. All steps, as well as some roof and terrace surfaces, are topped with vegetation, making the condo buildings resemble rock formations overgrown with moss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We want the park to come into the building," Mr. Marvel says. "The public benefit is that the building is going to blend with the park. That's a very important part of the design. We didn't want the building to draw too much attention to itself. We wanted it to be a good neighbor."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's important with this project in particular, because Brooklyn Bridge Park's development has been fraught with politics. Critics have said the park was built as a favor to real-estate developers, who wanted to use the waterfront green spaces as a fancy front lawn to juice the values of their condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The park's planners, including its landscape architect, Matthew Urbanski of <span class="companylink">Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates Inc</span>., have responded that the project was designed for the public first. In addition, fees generated by the condo and hotel properties will pay some $3.3 million of the park's annual maintenance cost. <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> and Starwood will cover these fees initially, and later the condo owners will contribute as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there is the question of the architect's responsibility to build structures that are neighborly but at the same time consequential to the landscape. Given such a handsome front yard and such a prominent location, don't Starwood, <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> and the park's nonprofit managers, who selected them, owe the public a great set of buildings?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this sense, the design largely succeeds, with a few exceptions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The step-up design is a welcome novelty, and helps break the buildings' mass into smaller units, giving the project a somewhat demure scale and character. In addition, Mr. Marvel is leaning toward constructing the residential building's bones out of white limestone, quarried from Maine. Limestone, unlike other, less-gentle stones, looks gorgeous in the changing light at different times of day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This isn't lost on Mr. Marvel, who has studied and worked under famed modernist architects Henry Cobb and Richard Meier, and also is trained as a painter. Parkgoers, ferry passengers and drivers crossing the Brooklyn Bridge will see a building near the water that changes with the light from the river, burning brown in late afternoon sun and cooling off in the early morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hotel's design, however, still sticks out. Mr. Marvel has carved out a pedestrian "pass-through" between the hotel and the condo sections, but he also plans to make the hotel as a softly lit "beacon" at night, and with so much glass, the structure will look anesthetized and bright.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Von Spreckelsen, who heads the <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> City Living division, which is quarterbacking this project, said the design team has taken steps to soften the hotel's original design by giving it more natural finishes and coating support columns with wood, for example. "We wanted to respect the park, not overwhelm it," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These touches are nice, but the hotel design is still short of the type of iconic status that Mr. Marvel says is his responsibility. That said, it is a tremendous improvement over the barnlike structure originally proposed by Starwood early on. The park selected the Toll/Starwood team this year after Toll's chairman, Bob Toll, and Starwood's chief executive, Barry Sternlicht -- old friends in the business world -- decided to join forces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, the design is still in flux and hasn't received its final blessing from the park's board. But as an early draft, the Brooklyn Bridge Park's first large-scale commercial construction project reads like bad news, well-written: It's a shame that the park's maintenance has to be tied to the success of a hotel/condo, but an occasion of clemency that the buildings themselves look quite at home.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers are wrestling with a dilemma about the overhang of mortgage debt from the housing bust: to forgive or not to forgive?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With prices down by one-third from their 2006 peak, more than 11 million homeowners are underwater, or owe more than their homes are worth. That is about 24% of all homeowners with a mortgage, according to data firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The massive debt overhang -- totaling almost $700 billion -- is troubling not only because it leaves homeowners more exposed to foreclosure, which further erodes property values. It also weighs on the economy, making homeowners less likely to spruce up their properties and unable to tap equity to start businesses or pay for things like college tuition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing demand also suffers. Without equity, young families are less likely to trade up to bigger places while empty-nesters may be unable to downsize. Perversely, in some of the hardest-hit markets, home prices appear to be stabilizing because there aren't enough homes for sale -- in part because so many homeowners are frozen in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent home-price gains will help a little. <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> estimates that during the first quarter, about 700,000 borrowers climbed out of negative equity thanks to modest price appreciation. But in a handful of states, more than one-third of borrowers are still underwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is reviving calls for policy makers to embrace principal forgiveness. One problem is deciding who deserves help and who doesn't -- and who will absorb the losses: taxpayers or mortgage investors. Often the two are the same because taxpayer-supported entities like <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> back about 60% of all mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists are split. "There's no question that in many cases, [principal forgiveness] is the only way to assure people will stay in the house," says Kenneth Rosen of the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others say what really matters to borrowers is an affordable monthly payment. "If people have a huge debt burden but the mortgage is not the problem, why are we reducing the mortgage?" asks Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist in Leesburg, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie and Freddie's federal regulator has been wary of debt forgiveness, saying there are cheaper ways to help homeowners avoid foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury Department tried to force the issue this year when it offered to pick up part of the tab for Fannie and Freddie if the government-supported mortgage giants adopted an existing federal program that subsidizes such write-downs for struggling borrowers. Economists estimate the firms could reach about 300,000 borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cost isn't the only issue. Trimming debt only for homeowners who are behind on their mortgage payments could lead other homeowners to default in hopes of getting a break -- and could inflame those who believe it is unfair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is there a way to end this stalemate? Among the ideas offered by economists, private investors and government agencies:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- First, Fannie and Freddie could cover closing costs for underwater borrowers who refinance into shorter-term loans with lower rates. Already, Fannie and Freddie have relaxed refinancing rules so that anyone with a loan backed by the firms can refinance, no matter how underwater, as long as they are current on payments. Accelerating amortization provides less of a break than principal reduction, but it nevertheless returns the borrower to terra firma much sooner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Columbia University economists Glenn Hubbard, Christopher Mayer, James Witkin and mortgage-bond veteran Alan Boyce spelled out in a paper how this might work. A homeowner who owes 117% of his home's value and who took out a 30-year loan with a 6.7% rate five years ago could refinance now into a 15-year loan with a 3.1% rate. That would increase the monthly payment by just $24. But it would leave the borrower with positive equity in less than three years, assuming home prices stay flat; within five years, the homeowner would have 17% equity. Doing nothing, the borrower would be underwater for more than seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Second, mortgage investors could structure "earned" forgiveness programs that effectively pay deeply underwater borrowers to stay current on their mortgages. Loan Value Group, a Rumson, N.J.-based outfit, has designed such a program, called the "Responsible Homeowner Reward," and is working with about 25,000 borrowers from a half-dozen mortgage firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program works like this: Participating mortgage investors enroll borrowers who receive a small cash "reward" every month that they make their payments. The reward might grow to 10% of the loan balance, but it can be claimed only at some time in the future, usually when the borrower pays off the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Finally, if Fannie and Freddie aren't comfortable implementing a principal-writedown program of their own, they could ramp up sales of defaulted mortgages to investors who buy them at a discount, cut the loan balance, and make money by keeping the borrower in the house. The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> this month said it would sell about 9,000 of those nonperforming mortgages later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other initiatives have run into a buzz saw of protest from mortgage investors, including a bid by the White House three years ago to allow judges to write down loans during bankruptcy proceedings. More recently, local governments in California have broached the idea of seizing mortgages through eminent domain and then restructuring them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Principal reduction isn't a panacea for the nation's housing market. But in a handful of markets, the negative-equity problem will persist for many years. It makes sense for policy makers to at least experiment with how to speed along the clearing process.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan   </div><div>996 words</div><div>28 July 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MISSION, Texas -- For many home buyers, the biggest motivations behind moving to a new neighborhood are a job change, rising wealth or a growing family. For Graciela Gonzalez, a private-school administrator from the nearby Mexican state of Tamaulipas, it was the constant threat of kidnapping and murder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, Ms. Gonzalez said, eight parents of children at the private school where she works were kidnapped and held for ransom by drug-cartel thugs. Frightened they would be next, she and her husband, Juan, an architect, drove across the border and bought a three-bedroom house for $180,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past two years, she and her husband have been living here on tourist visas and working remotely, traveling back to Mexico only once every few months. Six months ago, she applied for an investor visa so she can gain U.S. residency. "It's very sad to have to choose between your life and your lifestyle," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As violence in Mexico has escalated, some affluent Mexicans have fled to border cities in Texas, turning impoverished places such as McAllen and Mission into unlikely beneficiaries of Mexico's gruesome drug war. Others, including some criminals targeted by rival cartels, are heading farther north to the wealthy suburbs of Houston, Dallas and San Antonio, where one transplant is awaiting trial for allegedly laundering money for a cartel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Mission, Realtors are doing brisk business and builders are rushing to put up hacienda-style homes with stucco walls and red-tiled roofs. Mexican nationals are opening restaurants and other businesses, applying for permanent residency visas and establishing tightknit communities of expats who socialize together, send their kids to local schools and form business associations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beto Salinas, Mission's mayor, said in a recent interview at City Hall that the fallout from the violence has provided an unexpected boost to his town. "There are a lot of guys who come here from Mexico, build a million-dollar home, live here and let other people run their businesses," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the influx of wealthy Mexicans hasn't had a major impact on low-income residents. The part of Texas that includes McAllen and Mission is still the nation's poorest large metropolitan area, with more than a third of its residents living below the poverty line, according to a November report from the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that could slowly change if the number of wealthy residents continues to grow. Already, the newcomers have helped buoy the local housing market. While home sales and prices crashed in most other U.S. cities after the 2008 financial crisis, home sales in the McAllen-Mission metro area have stayed consistent at about 2,400 sales a year since 2008, and the median sale price has risen 3% to $102,000 over that period, according to the local multiple-listing service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Half of my business last year was Mexican nationals leaving Mexico because of violence," said Rene Galvan, a Realtor based in McAllen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are responding to the increased demand as well. The value of Mission's taxable residential property has swelled to $3.2 billion today from $2.6 billion in 2007, as builders have put up hundreds of new homes. Miguel Brito, sales manager for Brito Construction, a small builder here, said he has consistently sold 45 to 55 new homes a year since 2009, and that 80% of his customers are Mexican.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I get calls every day from people who say, 'The violence has been too much,' " Mr. Brito said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most popular development for Mexican buyers, according to Mr. Brito, is Sharyland Plantation, a 6,000-acre master-planned community in Mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, Sharyland High School's boys soccer team won its first state championship. Rev Hernandez, the team's coach, said that one of the team's biggest stars was Jorge Medina, a senior goaltender who relocated to Sharyland last year from Monterrey, and who stopped four penalty shots in a hotly contested playoff game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local government officials have welcomed the foreigners with open arms. Last year, McAllen established a regional EB-5 Center, a corporation owned by the city that administers green cards to foreign nationals in return for investments of $1 million or sometimes less that create at least 10 full-time jobs. Federal immigration officials are currently reviewing investors in the region's first EB-5 investment, a $15 million hotel-construction project funded by 16 Mexicans, 14 of whom seeking residency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last August, armed cartel men set fire to a casino in Monterrey, killing 45 people, while in April of last year, police in Tamaulipas, the state across the border from McAllen, found 183 corpses in a mass grave, which government officials blamed on cartel violence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jesus Gomez owns a Monterrey factory with 250 workers that makes tempered glass for shower doors and curtain walls for buildings. Six months ago, he bought a house in a quiet neighborhood in McAllen after receiving five threatening phone calls from people he described as "vigilantes" looking for money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, he relies on his managers to take care of day-to-day business at the factory, and communicates with them mostly by phone and email. He and his wife have joined a local church congregation, and he has become a Dallas Cowboys football fan. On weekends, his three children come to visit and bring his young grandchildren to play in their pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's hard to explain what it's like to live in Monterrey these days. Everything has changed. You can't work freely there, if you have a business," he said. Now, in his new home, "it's really nice to be able to walk the streets and just relax."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel   </div><div>799 words</div><div>26 July 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales rose sharply in the Hamptons this spring to the highest levels in years, but the increase didn't include the huge estates and oceanfront mansions favored by the very rich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, less well-heeled home buyers stepped in to pick up what passes for lower-priced second homes in the Hamptons—those under $1 million, which had seen steep price declines over recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of these homes rose earlier in the year and then spiked by 42% during the second quarter compared with the same quarter in 2011, according to market report being released Thursday by Brown Harris Stevens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, only 12 homes sold for more than $8 million during the latest quarter, the report found, the same number as the same quarter last year. The biggest sale of the quarter was far from a blockbuster—a $27.25 million sale of a 7,000-square-foot house on the ocean on Surfside Drive in Bridgehampton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving the increase in these lower-end sales, brokers said, was job growth in the New York City economy, lower asking prices and a change in lifestyle that is leading members of the baby-boom generation to look for second homes closer to home rather than in other parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It shows that when things pick up in New York, they pick up here, too," said Cia Comnas, who oversees Brown Harris Stevens offices in the Hamptons. She said strong activity was continuing in July, normally a slow month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dottie Herman, the president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said the second-home market had revived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It hasn't done what the city has done, but it has done a lot better than the rest of Long Island and the rest of the country," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Eyre, a retired school administrator in Westfield N.J., looked to buy a second home in the Hamptons in 2007, but said he was "kind of discouraged by the prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he tried again last year, he and his broker, Hara Kang of Prudential Douglas Elliman, found sellers much more willing to negotiate. Earlier this year, he and his partner closed on a four-bedroom house with a pool for $640,000 in the Springs section of East Hampton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A previous owner had paid $725,000 for the same house in 2005, and then completely renovated the property, finished the basement, replaced the mechanicals and extended the deck around the pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The ability to negotiate has improved dramatically and we have been able to close a lot more deals," Mr. Kang said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new Brown Harris Stevens report found that the sales for less than $1 million accounted for 56% of all transactions in the Hampton, up from 49% a year ago. This pickup in lower-priced sales had the effect of bringing down median prices for all sales, the report found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another market report by Prudential Douglas Elliman found that the number of sales in the second quarter were the highest since the first quarter of 2007, a time when sale prices were hitting a peak and when many would-be buyers found themselves priced out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That report found that the median price fell 9.3% in the latest quarter from the same quarter last year to $850,000, while the average price was down by less by 1% to $1.724 million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, the president of Miller Samuel Inc, who prepared the Elliman report, noted several pockets of strength in addition to the below-$1 million market. He said that strong activity between $5 million and $8 million showed that foreign buyers were still active in the Hamptons market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is still a pretty strong presence in the upper end," he said. "It is just not as far up as the upper, upper end."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Saunders, the president of Saunders &amp; Associates, an East End firm, said that it was one of the oddities of the market that "under $2 million in the Hamptons is perversely regarded as the lower end of the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you take $2 million to Cincinnati you are like Sinatra," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outlook for the rest of the year is uncertain, brokers say. Mr. Saunders noted that a strong market at the start of last year was chilled later in the year by negative economic news. So far this year, he said there was "tremendous conviction in the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other brokers said that high-end sales may pick up later in 2012, as sellers rush to close deals before year end when taxes on capital gains may rise sharply.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes in the U.S. fell in June to the lowest level in five months, showing that the recovery of the housing market remains uneven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New single-family home sales decreased by 8.4% from May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 350,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. June's sales were the lowest since January but were up 15.1% compared to the same month a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Results were lower than expected. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast an annual rate of 375,000, which would have been a 1.6% gain over the figure previously reported for May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate of sales in the previous three months was revised upward, to 382,000 in May, 358,000 in April and 352,000 in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for a new home, meanwhile, fell in June 3.2% from the same month a year ago to a median of $232,600.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The June data reflect a reversal of recent gains made in the housing market. It is still coping with the aftermath of a collapse in prices that started six years ago, and there are still signs of weakness. Sales of previously occupied homes dropped 5.4% in June to the lowest level in eight months amid a thin inventory of properties for sale, the National Association of Realtors said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective homeowners face tightened credit restrictions that make it hard to secure record-low mortgage rates. And more than 11 million Americans owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, so these "underwater" homeowners are less likely to move if they can't sell their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview with Charlie Rose Monday, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said the housing market is "still very tough." The administration has worked hard to help distressed homeowners, but there is much more to be done, Mr. Geithner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some signs of growth. Home construction jumped 6.9% last month to the highest level since October 2008, the Commerce Department reported last week. Home builder confidence this month took its biggest monthly jump in nearly a decade, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales peaked in July 2005, when they hit an annual pace of nearly 1.4 million. Sales fell to a slow pace of 273,000 in February 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tough sales have climbed back since the depths of the housing bust, the pace of new-home sales remains well below historical levels. Since 1963, an average of 671,000 new single-family homes has been sold per year in the U.S. Last year's level of 306,000 sales was the lowest on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report showed the number of new homes listed for sale, seasonally adjusted, at the end of June was 144,000. The supply would take 4.9 months to deplete at the current sales pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">June's new-home sales were down in two out of four U.S. regions. Sales dropped 60.0% in the Northeast and 8.6% in the South. Sales rose 14.6% in the Midwest and 2.1% in the West.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in the second quarter rose from the year-ago period for the first time since 2007, according to a closely watched index, the latest indication the housing market is starting to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, from real-estate firm <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>., found that for the quarter ending in June, home values were up 0.2% from the same period in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While other indicators have shown home prices turning up since the spring, most examined short-term changes from one month to the next. Other indexes reported gains in median sales prices, which can be skewed based on the type of homes that are sold. But Zillow measures prices of comparable homes in the same community, which some economists say provides a truer picture of market trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report, also released Tuesday, also showed signs of a gradual recovery. Home prices rose 0.8% on a seasonally adjusted basis in May from a month earlier, according to the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>'s monthly home-price index. Compared with a year earlier, home prices were up 3.7%. The monthly increase was the fourth consecutive increase, and the size of the rise was better than the 0.3% that economists on average had expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Zillow report, nearly one-third of the 167 metropolitan areas tracked posted annual price increases for the second quarter compared with the year-ago period. Prices rose fastest in cities with fewer homes for sale and strong investor demand. Phoenix prices rose 12% from one year ago while Miami was up 6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It seems clear that the country has hit a bottom in home values," said Stan Humphries, Zillow's chief economist, who had previously forecast that housing wouldn't hit bottom until late this year or early in 2013. The fact that the gains came during a period in which the economy wasn't very strong suggests "there's some fundamental organic strength to the housing market," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modest uptick in demand is pushing prices higher because the supply of homes for sale has fallen sharply. This has created unexpected problems for owners like Peter Jones, who is set to close on the sale of his four-bedroom house in Tampa, Fla. on Friday. The good news is that he is getting nearly $75,000 more than he paid for the home two years ago. The bad news: It sold faster than he expected and he hasn't been able to find another place to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm under the gun," said Mr. Jones, 31. He has made offers on two waterfront homes in nearby St. Petersburg listed as short sales, where the bank must agree to accept a loss. "Now is the time to do it," said Mr. Jones. "In a year or two, the houses are just going to be more expensive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Zillow, prices climbed 2.1% from the first quarter to the second, the largest such gain since the end of 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal's quarterly survey of housing-market conditions in 28 U.S. metropolitan areas shows that inventories of unsold homes have fallen in every market and are down by more than 20% in two-thirds of those markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing inventories are falling for several reasons. Banks have listed fewer foreclosed properties for sale as they have modified more troubled loans and approved more short sales. Foreclosure listings are down by 23% from one year ago to their lowest level since October 2009, according to research firm Zelman &amp; Associates. Some investors are renting out those foreclosures, which also is putting a lid on inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the biggest force behind reduced inventories are owners who don't want to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have people electing not to list in this environment . . . because they think they can get a good price if they wait a little while," said Richard Smith, chief executive of Realogy Corp., which owns the Coldwell Banker and Century 21 real-estate brands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few economists are predicting a strong recovery because many households have too much debt to qualify for a mortgage. Also, there is a large "shadow supply" of more than 3 million mortgaged properties in some stage of foreclosure or serious delinquency that haven't been taken back by lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the biggest worry for now is that the economy isn't adding enough jobs. A rise in foreclosures isn't "as worrisome as what would happen if the economy slowed really sharply. That would be bad," said Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist in Leesburg, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Zillow, markets with the biggest declines between the second quarters of 2011 and 2012 included Atlanta, where values were down by 6%, and Chicago, down 5%. Both cities have had weak demand and a glut of homes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, rebuilding of the World Trade Center site was held up by construction delays and fights between government agencies, insurers and a developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the problem is a lack of tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While two office buildings are well underway at Ground Zero, construction of a third tower, 3 World Trade Center, is stalled at eight stories, well shy of the 80 floors planned. The reason: its developer, <span class="companylink">Silverstein Properties Inc</span>, the company run by Larry Silverstein, hasn't been able to find a tenant, and he can't build any higher without one, based on a two-year-old deal with government agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Silverstein started construction in mid-2010 on the building, then-expected to have 2.5 million square feet of space, he had hoped he would be able to find a tenant and keep building to the top. But cement stopped pouring at the eighth floor in the past few weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stunted growth of 3 World Trade Center reflects the stagnation that has taken hold in the nation's largest office market and the struggles Lower Manhattan faces in rebuilding the more than 11 million square feet of space lost in the 2001 terrorist attacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial firms, traditionally the tenants that give developers reason to build, are contracting, stung by a slow economy and disappointing earnings. Several big banks last week announced plans for a new round of cuts. Companies from <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. to <span class="companylink">Pfizer Inc</span>. have opted to cut back on their office space in the city in the past year, citing no current need for the real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Silverstein hopes he can resume the upward momentum on 3 World Trade Center soon. His neighboring tower at the site, 4 World Trade Center, is due for completion by late 2013 and is about half-leased by government agencies. The signature tower on the site, One World Trade Center, which is being built by the <span class="companylink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</span>, is 55% leased, mostly to publisher Conde Nast. Once called the Freedom Tower, it is due for completion in early 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Silverstein's plans for 2 World Trade Center, which would have been the second-largest tower on the site, have been put on the shelf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two towers nearing completion have nearly 2.5 million square feet unspoken for, roughly as large as 30 Rockefeller Center in Midtown Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're excellent office buildings," said Mark Weiss, vice chairman at real-estate services firm Newmark Grubb <span class="companylink">Knight Frank</span> who represents tenants that have looked at the site. "There's just not demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the developers say they are bullish on their ability to lease up the buildings, slow job growth, economic uncertainty and companies opting against moving as a cost-savings measure are putting pressures on New York landlords and developers looking to lure tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far in 2012, 40% of Manhattan leases tracked by real-estate brokerage firm <span class="companylink">Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc</span>. have been renewals of existing space, more than double the proportion in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, large companies such as <span class="companylink">Time Warner Inc</span>. are searching for Manhattan space, and many companies prefer new towers to old, which could put 3 World Trade and the other towers at the site well-positioned once the economy improves and companies are ready to move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Silverstein is confident he will eventually line up enough tenants to resume building. "We are 100% committed to building 3 World Trade Center to the top as quickly as possible," said Janno Lieber, Mr. Silverstein's deputy who oversees the World Trade Center development. "We are marketing the tower widely and remain optimistic that we can meet our preleasing targets over the next year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lieber said a slower-than-anticipated recovery has made for a more-challenging environment, and "the predominant factor" affecting all new projects is that companies are increasingly choosing to renew their leases instead of move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Silverstein, 81 years old, has been a fixture at the World Trade Center site since weeks before the towers were attacked on Sept. 11, 2001. He won the long-term lease to control the twin towers. In better times, he and the <span class="companylink">Port Authority</span> imagined four towers would rise together. The economic downturn threw cold water on that vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for 3 World Trade Center, Mr. Silverstein needs a tenant of at least 400,000 square feet to continue, based on a 2010 subsidy deal with government agencies. Without it, the first eight floors would be completed, perhaps to hold retail.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos and Kelsey Gee   </div><div>763 words</div><div>20 July 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing markets that just two years ago struggled with a glut of homes are now facing a new problem: There are fewer properties to lure buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell 5.4% in June from May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.37 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday. While above the sales level of a year ago, the number nonetheless disappointed analysts because other recent housing indicators have signaled stronger improvement. The housing market is "back on track" but there will be "bumps on the road," said Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists and the Realtors' group attributed last month's decline to a sharp drop in the number of homes on the market, leaving would-be buyers with less to choose from.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of single-family homes fell to 2.12 million in June, down 3% from May and 24% from one year ago. That is the largest annual drop in at least 30 years, leaving inventories at roughly the historic levels that preceded the housing bubble of the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing demand has been picked up this year thanks to an economy that is growing, albeit slowly. However, weakness persists in the labor market. The number of new claims for unemployment benefits surged last week to a seasonally adjusted 386,000, the government said Thursday. But the latest increase follows an unusually steep slide the prior week that economists said resulted from faulty seasonal adjustments to the data related to expected auto-plant retoolings. Economists said it will take a few weeks to get a better read on the actual level of claims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The declines in the housing inventory reflect several factors. Banks have been slower to sell foreclosures. At the same time, investors are snapping up properties and renting them out, rather than flipping them for a profit. That is keeping properties off the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's just been a massive drop in the number of foreclosures for sale, and in the number of foreclosures being sold," said Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist in Leesburg, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes sold in June in the West for less than $100,000 -- primarily foreclosures and other distressed sales -- was down by 36% from a year ago. Sales of homes priced between $250,000 and $500,000, meanwhile, rose by 17%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of foreclosed homes in June were down by 72% in Phoenix and 46% in Sacramento, Calif., from one year ago. That more than offset increased sales of non-foreclosed homes, which were up by 19% and 34%, respectively, according to local real-estate data tracked by Mr. Lawler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you look at where sales declined the most, it's in the same places where inventory declined the most," said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Trulia, a real-estate website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For-sale supplies also are lean in some of the hardest-hit markets because traditional sellers may be unable to sell, particularly if they owe more than their homes are worth. Even those who have equity may be unwilling to accept the large discounts compared with five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big drops in the number of homes for sale aren't good news for home buyers, but they are helping to stabilize and even increase home prices, benefitting sellers. Median home prices rose in June for the fourth straight month and were up by 7.9% from one year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists said the decline in inventory is typical for markets experiencing a home-price bottom because everyone wants to buy at the bottom, but few want to sell. "As prices rise, buyers will get more impatient and sellers get patient," said Mr. Kolko. Eventually, rising prices should prompt more sellers to list their homes, but that could prevent prices from rising much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Priti Mody-Pan and husband Kojay Pan, both 37 years old, decided to sell the three-bedroom home in Renton, Wash., that they bought 10 years ago as newlyweds so they could move to a better school district in nearby Issaquah. They have a son entering elementary school and a daughter heading into first grade. After the house was on the market for three days in May, the couple received two offers and agreed to sell for 2% below their $315,000 asking price. Ms. Mody-Pan said she felt they got a good deal on the newer four-bedroom home they bought for $600,000.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Amy Guthrie   </div><div>639 words</div><div>20 July 2012</div><div>13:07</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MEXICO CITY—Cemex SAB said Friday that a recovery in U.S. demand for its building materials helped compensate for sluggish infrastructure spending in Mexico and Europe during the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mexico-based Cemex, the world's third-largest cement company, said the increase in volume sales to the U.S. reflected improved demand in most of its markets there, including the residential housing sector. Cemex was also able to implement price increases for its cement, ready-mix and aggregates products in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cemex's U.S. operations had been a drag on financial results for several years. But in the April-June period, the business reported positive operating earnings for the first time in eight quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. business recorded operating earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, of $27 million in the second quarter compared with a loss of $17 million a year earlier. Sales in the U.S. rose 15% to $795 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are very positive on the evolution of the market in the U.S., finally, after so many years," Fernando Gonzalez, Cemex's executive vice president of finance and administration, told analysts during a conference call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> economists noted Friday that the U.S. housing market continues to improve, with construction activity growing at a double-digit pace, home sales up sharply from their cyclical lows while inventory levels are down sharply from their highs, and prices now rising after a prolonged downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts in several states in which Cemex's business is concentrated, such as California and Texas, are actually outperforming the national market, Cemex officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cemex's U.S. sales still have much room to improve. In the second quarter of 2008, for instance, as the home construction sector there was contracting, Cemex showed U.S. sales of $1.3 billion, $500 million more than in the latest quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company raised its exposure to the U.S. market in 2007 via a credit-fueled purchase of <span class="companylink">Rinker Group Ltd</span>., after which Cemex's net debt more than tripled to $18.9 billion. The financial crisis of 2008-09 turned Rinker's concentration of assets in the U.S. into a liability, and Cemex was forced to refinance $15 billion of bank debt to avoid a default. The company said it reduced its total debt plus perpetual notes by $529 million during the second quarter, to $17.64 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The progress in the U.S. contrasts with difficulties for Cemex elsewhere. Lower infrastructure spending in the company's two biggest markets—Mexico and Northern Europe—cut Cemex's consolidated quarterly net sales by 7% to $3.86 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more-cautious-than-expected stance from the Mexican government toward infrastructure spending before the July 1 presidential election, coupled with financial constraints faced by home builders, curbed volume sales in Mexico. In dollar terms, Mexican sales fell 14% on the year to $833 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Europe, reduced public-sector spending and unfavorable weather conditions contributed to a sharp reduction in Cemex's volume sales. Northern Europe sales fell 18% from the year-earlier quarter, to $1.10 billion. The cement firm has reduced production at several European plants to adjust for reduced demand as the continent faces an economic crisis, while exporting excess product from Spain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second-quarter sales gains in smaller Cemex markets, such as Asia and South America, also helped compensate for the declines in Mexico and Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cemex said its consolidated operating Ebitda rose 11% on the year in the second quarter, to $702 million. Still, it had a consolidated controlling interest net loss for the second quarter of $187 million, compared with a loss of $209 million a year earlier.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Neil Shah, Jie Jenny Zou and Nick Timiraos </div><div>848 words</div><div>19 July 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy is downshifting, even as the housing sector is finally showing signs of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report Wednesday showed builders broke ground for more new homes in June than in any month in nearly four years. But the upturn comes as several other pockets of relative strength for the economy have wavered. Consumer spending is sputtering, manufacturing growth has slowed, and businesses have grown cautious about splurging on new machines and computers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most economists now expect second-quarter growth to come in much slower than the first quarter's tepid 1.9% pace, and they say that the outlook is darkening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This picture is putting added pressure on the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> to take steps to boost growth. That was on display this week in Washington, where Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke testified to Congress that it was "certainly possible" the central bank could take new steps to support growth -- yet offered no details of what those might be. Asked about the green shoots in housing, the chairman said they were clearly a positive. But he added that the sector still faces huge hurdles, including a backlog of homes likely to come onto the market in coming months, depressing prices, and the difficulty people have getting credit to buy houses when they do come available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're trapped in this relatively modestly growing economy," said Daniel Meckstroth, chief economist at the Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation, a research group in Arlington, Va. While the U.S.'s manufacturing sector and exports powered the recovery for the past two years, Mr. Meckstroth doesn't expect them to contribute as much to growth this year, given the economic slowdown in Europe and emerging markets such as China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week brought fresh evidence that the U.S. recovery is experiencing a flip-flop, with housing picking up but other areas -- such as consumer spending, manufacturing and hiring -- all sagging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's housing report from the Commerce Department showed home construction jumped 6.9% from May, to a seasonally adjusted rate of 760,000. Because builders cut back so sharply during the downturn, "if there's an increase in the number of households of any magnitude, the home builders will now benefit," says Daniel Alpert, managing director at <span class="companylink">Westwood Capital</span>, an investment-banking firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But an upturn in housing is a limited engine for the larger economy. Cutbacks on home construction shaved as much as a full percentage point from GDP during the darkest days of 2007 and 2008. This year, construction should turn positive -- adding around 0.3 percentage points to GDP, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, housing could still weigh on the economy in other ways. Before the downturn, Americans relied on rising home equity to fix up their homes, pay for vacations, or to fund college tuitions or new businesses. With nearly $7 trillion in housing value wiped out from the market's 2006 peak, more than 11 million Americans owe more than their homes are worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics expects that the wealth effect from housing -- where people spend money based on the value of their home -- will still subtract from GDP this year, offsetting some gains from revved-up construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This helps explain why, despite the good news about housing, the outlook for the economy has darkened. Retail sales sank for the third straight month in June, the government said Monday -- resulting in the first three-month slump since the global financial crisis in 2008. And consumer confidence fell during July to its lowest level since December, a recent survey showed. Despite easing prices for gasoline, consumers appear to be saving instead of spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sabina Sawahney, 48 years old, who owns High Design Jewelry, a Manhattan costume-jewelry seller, has had disappointing sales as foot traffic has dwindled. "There's no one," says Ms. Sawahney, who relies on tourists to frequent her shop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America's manufacturers have been hurt by weak demand at home and economic turmoil abroad. Factory output rose 0.7% in June, but slumped 0.7% the previous month, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> said Tuesday. Still, the larger picture is one of a slowing factory sector: Manufacturing output grew at an annual rate of just 1.4% in the second quarter, a sharp slowdown from 9.8% in the first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">A.O. Smith Corp</span>., a Milwaukee-based water-heater maker, blames a lack of consumer confidence and overall economic instability for lackluster domestic growth. "We're seeing a flat year," says Mark Petrarca, senior vice president of human resources and public affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s latest snapshot of regional economic conditions, which was released Wednesday, captures the divide between housing and other sectors of the economy. Based on comments from businesses and other contacts collected before July 9, Fed analysts said "all District housing market reports were largely positive," but that employment levels improved "at a tepid pace for most Districts."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Mortgage Bonds Yield Hopeful Signs on Housing Recovery</span>
</div><div class="author">By Al Yoon   </div><div>718 words</div><div>19 July 2012</div><div>13:46</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest sign that the real-estate slump may have hit bottom, the bond investors who are among the most exposed to the vagaries of the housing market are finally starting to price in a recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonagency mortgage bonds—representing $1.1 trillion in mortgage debt that isn't guaranteed by a federal agency like <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>—have already gained 3% to 10% this year, in part because investors are reversing the most pessimistic estimates of losses they may suffer because of delinquencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are not completely annihilating these bonds anymore" by assuming the worst, said Paul Nikodem, a strategist at Nomura Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After suffering from the fallout of rapid downgrades of subprime and other risky mortgage securities in 2007 and 2008, investors in nonagency bonds learned to protect themselves by pricing bonds low enough to assure good returns even if defaults kept climbing and home prices extended their deep dive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now investors are beginning to ease up on assumptions used to calculate "loss-adjusted yields"—the estimated return on a mortgage bond including expected losses—as data suggest the U.S. housing market is at or near a bottom and may be poised to rise. Some investors are actually predicting a steep rally while others are merely rethinking the harsh scenarios baked into bond prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is just starting to assimilate some of the numbers we've seen in terms of stabilization in housing," said Randy Robertson, head of securitized assets at <span class="companylink">BlackRock Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent reports of rising home prices in <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller indexes and from the National Association of Realtors are bolstering the growing view that the housing market has bottomed. On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said home building rose in June to its highest level in nearly four years, a sign that sector may be a support, rather than a drag, on the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, anecdotal evidence of rising demand for foreclosed properties is encouraging bondholders because higher bids will boost the proceeds to bonds, said Jonathan Lieberman, chief investment officer of <span class="companylink">AG Mortgage Investment Trust</span>, which is looking to add more nonagency bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now, investors have seen little reason to price in a recovery. Most braced for a retrenchment as a wave of foreclosed properties was set to flood the market, "and they've consistently been right," Nomura's Mr. Nikodem said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market is far from healthy. Nomura estimates losses on subprime bonds will edge higher. But optimists note that one loss measure, called "severity" in the industry, for nonmodified subprime bonds climbed just 1 percentage point in the past year to 82%, after marching higher from near 70% in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with recent encouraging housing data, moderating "severity" has investors pricing in lower losses for the first time since the bubble burst. As a result, the loss-adjusted yields are rising, said Bryan Whalen, a managing director at TCW Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our stance is that [the likely loss-adjusted yields on] these bonds are not 8% or so, they are 11% or 12%," said Mr. Whalen, who added that he expects the mortgage-bond rally to accelerate as participants price in greater payments from the bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shifting outlook in housing and mortgage bonds isn't free of risks, however. The shadow inventory—millions of foreclosed houses that banks haven't yet tried to sell—is a cloud over the industry; economists are cutting growth forecasts as the jobs recovery has slowed; and Europe's sovereign-debt crisis remains in flux.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonagency bond sales have intensified this week with more than $5 billion offered, presenting a test to prices that have so far held up, according to an investor briefed by traders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LibreMax Capital, whose manager, Greg Lippman, helped <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span> profit from the crumbling mortgage-bond market in 2008, has already sold its subprime holdings, to lock in profits. "Broadening investor interest" provided the opportunity to sell, the firm said in an investor note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BlackRock is cautious in its enthusiasm for housing. The firm's adjustments to its forward-looking assumptions are "much milder" than the broader market, Mr. Robertson said.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Australian Dollar Rallies</span>
</div><div class="author">By Nicole Hong   </div><div>569 words</div><div>18 July 2012</div><div>21:17</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Australian dollar hit an 11-week high against the U.S. dollar and a euro-era record against the common currency, as investors hopeful that a serious global slowdown could be avoided sought higher-yielding assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Aussie jumped to US$1.0376, its highest since May 1, before ending the New York trading day at $1.0364, compared with $1.0315 late Tuesday. The Australian currency is up more than 2% in the past four trading days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Better-than-expected corporate earnings, rising commodities prices and a lack of negative developments out of Europe have all boosted investor optimism this week, analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Aussie has come to represent the currency of optimism," said Greg Anderson, a currency strategist at <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> in New York. "When sentiment improves, everybody runs out to go long the Aussie."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's gains were also driven by the Tuesday release of minutes from the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of Australia</span>'s meeting earlier this month, where policy makers said they "saw no need" for more interest-rate cuts and that Australia's economy had more momentum than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Aussie is attractive to investors because Australia is one of the few remaining triple-A-rated sovereigns. The RBA has also set its benchmark interest rate at 3.5%, while most other major economies, including the U.S., euro-zone and Japan, are below 1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, slowing Chinese growth could limit a sustained Aussie's rally since resource-rich Australia is heavily dependent on Chinese demand for natural resources. However, some investors may be buying the Australian dollar in spite of weak Chinese data because they perceive the Chinese central bank as "ahead of the curve in terms of stimulus," said Brad Bechtel, managing director at Faros Trading in Stamford, Conn. Mr. Bechtel predicts the Aussie could rise as high as $1.05 in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro also suffered against the Aussie, falling to a record low of A$1.1834 earlier. It recently traded at A$1.1854, compared with A$1.192 late Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The common currency was weaker across the board Wednesday after German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed doubts about the future of the "European project." The euro was lower against the dollar at $1.2280 from $1.2295 late Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke completed his two-part Congressional testimony, where he offered a downbeat assessment of the U.S. economy but little guidance on further Fed easing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currency markets ignored positive U.S. housing starts data, which showed home construction in June rose to its highest level in nearly four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the positive investor sentiment, the yen still gained against the euro and the dollar. Normally, the yen would fall on market optimism because investors would sell off currencies perceived as safer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late-afternoon trade, the dollar was at ¥78.77 compared with ¥79.07 late Tuesday, while the euro was at ¥96.745 from ¥97.23. The U.K. pound bought $1.5654 from $1.5660, while the dollar fetched 0.9779 Swiss franc from 0.9771 franc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.K. pound was under pressure after the most recent Bank of England minutes opened the door for a potential rate cut.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European stocks rose Wednesday, boosted by well-received corporate earnings, some upbeat U.S. data and a strong performance on Wall Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stoxx Europe 600 index closed up 1.1% at 258.93. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 gained 1% to 5685.77, France's CAC-40 advanced 1.8% to 3235.40, and Germany's DAX climbed 1.6% to 6684.42.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forecast-beating second-quarter earnings from Intel and <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> in the U.S. helped to underpin the tone, along with better-than-expected U.S. housing starts, which showed that home construction in May rose to the highest level in almost four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 103.16 points, or 0.8%, to 12908.70, while the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index tacked on 9.11 points, or 0.7%, to 1372.78. The Nasdaq Composite outpaced the other two measures as tech stocks soared, adding 32.56 points, or 1.1%, to 2942.60.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Intel was a strong gainer among Dow components, up 4% in late trade, after the blue-chip semiconductor maker topped earnings expectations, although it also lowered its full-year revenue-growth outlook, citing a more challenging macroeconomic environment. Strong earnings from VMWare and EMC also supported the sector. <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> was up 0.6% in late trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors also took comfort in comments from the International Monetary Fund, which called on European leaders to move quickly to stem the spread of the debt crisis across the euro zone and act as a lender of last resort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It said policy makers should start building a full banking union that would include a centralized supervisor for its entire financial system, and bring forward plans for a euro-zone-wide fund to guarantee deposits and pay for the winding down of banks deemed too big to fail. The IMF said the ECB should cut interest rates further, restart the bond-buying program and begin another long-term refinancing operation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't all clear sailing, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro fell to a session low against the dollar following unconfirmed reports that German Chancellor Angela Merkel has doubts about whether the European project will work. Ms. Merkel did say later that she was optimistic that efforts to save the euro would succeed and that Germany would benefit by standing by its euro neighbors. The common currency recovered some of its losses and by the time of the European markets' close, and was fetching $1.2278 late Wednesday in New York, down slightly from $1.2293 late Tuesday. The dollar slipped to 78.765 yen from 79.07 yen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.K., encouraging labor data for May and June lent support, while minutes of the latest Bank of England meeting showed that the monetary policy committee is actively considering another interest-rate cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's second day of testimony before Congress yielded few clues on monetary policy. Mr. Bernanke delivered a grim assessment of the U.S. economy but didn't announce further stimulus measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group</span> added 4.5% after the bank said second-quarter net profit rose 2.6% from the previous year and that it aims to boost capital by 15.3 billion Swiss francs ($15.7 billion) before the end of 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tiffany was up 4.7% in the U.S. after <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> upgraded the stock, arguing that its "long-term brand franchise remains rock-solid."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude for August delivery gained 65 cents a barrel, or 0.7%, to $89.87 on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>.

</div><div class="author">By Dawn Wotapka </div><div>819 words</div><div>18 July 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment developer <span class="companylink">UDR Inc</span>. is pushing forward with its plan to build up its portfolio in places like New York and Washington, while jettisoning properties in markets where it doesn't want to expand, despite a lack of enthusiasm from some investors regarding the strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its latest deal, UDR, Highlands Ranch, Colo., has sold 15 apartment communities with nearly 5,000 apartments in Phoenix, Jacksonville, Fla., Dallas and Richmond, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer, <span class="companylink">DRA Advisors LLC</span>, paid $477 million in the deal, which closed last month and is one of the largest multifamily deals this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several years ago, UDR, which was founded as <span class="companylink">United Dominion Realty Trust</span> in 1972, decided it wanted to focus less on middle America in favor of larger cities where rent is higher, job growth is above average and new supply is limited. In 2008, it sold roughly 40% of its portfolio, dumping more than 25,000 units in less-glitzy markets, including Ohio and the Carolinas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But UDR's share price hasn't kept up with its peers this year. Its stock is up 7.8% since January, well below the 23% rise at <span class="companylink">Apartment Investment &amp; Management Co</span>. and the 20% at <span class="companylink">Post Properties Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say that some investors have been concerned about the high prices UDR has been paying for properties in New York and Washington. "They tend to pay market prices," said Alexander Goldfarb, an analyst with <span class="companylink">Sandler O'Neill &amp; Partners</span>. He likes the company's purchases, but "you need a lot of rent growth."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company also has had a higher level of debt than some of its peers, which it has been working to reduce. UDR has sold $610 million worth of property this year and in May issued about $540 million in new stock. <span class="companylink">Robert W. Baird &amp; Co</span>. estimates total debt after the stock offering and asset sales was $3.44 billion, down from $3.9 billion at the end of 2011. UDR, which owns or has an ownership position in about 55,000 units, declined to comment. But Chief Executive Thomas Toomey said in a recent call with analysts that 2012 "is expected to be a better year for UDR than 2011" and deleveraging "remains a priority."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, owners of apartment buildings have done well thanks to the strong demand for rentals from people who can't or don't want to buy homes. Since hitting bottom in October 2009, the value of apartment buildings has risen 29%, according to the <span class="companylink">Moody's</span>/RCA Commercial Property Price Index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The properties that UDR just sold were built between 1986 and 2009 and have an average monthly rent of $881, according to UDR. The Sierra Foothills Apartments in Phoenix, for example, charges monthly rents from $698 to $1,148 and offers such amenities as a whirlpool spa, billiard and game room and volleyball court. Rents have increased 9% at that property since the end of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DRA, the buyer in the latest deals, is an institutional real-estate manager that controls more than 40,000 residential units. The purchase from UDR allowed it to take advantage of the strong rental market in areas that some public players are less keen on, said DRA Senior Managing Director Paul McEvoy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've always been a willing buyer of assets that they are leaving behind," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the recent sale, UDR exited from the Phoenix and Jacksonville markets. Meantime, UDR has been focused on New York for new properties. The company has spent more than $1 billion for properties there including a converted office building that was once <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>'s corporate headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, the company said it formed a joint venture with <span class="companylink">MetLife Inc</span>. that paid $630 million for Columbus Square, a complex of five high-rise apartment buildings on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Last, year it purchased 10 Hanover Square, another converted apartment building that once housed <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>. According to real-estate analysis firm Reis, New York boasts the nation's highest monthly rent of $2,935, more than double the national average. Through joint ventures, it has also acquired properties in Washington, Philadelphia, Austin, Texas, and other cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dave Bragg, an analyst with Zelman &amp; Associates, said his firm thinks the company got a fair price on the properties it sold. But some company watchers would like UDR to slow down its buying spree and focus on operating its portfolio and lowering debt that is above the sector's average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some industry watchers are concerned that UDR and other buyers could be forced to cut rents if the market weakens again, as it did after the financial crisis.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European stocks ended higher Wednesday, boosted by well-received corporate earnings, some upbeat U.S. data and a strong performance on Wall Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stoxx Europe 600 index closed up 1.1% at 258.93.

Meanwhile, Spain's benchmark IBEX-35 closed up 0.5% at 6591.20, and Italy's FTSE Mib ended up 0.4% at 13594.39.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greece's ASE Composite rose 0.2% at 613.65, paring gains into the close, having been significantly higher on news that the country's coalition partners have agreed on a basic outline for austerity plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forecast-beating second-quarter earnings from <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, Intel and <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> in the U.S. helped to underpin the tone, along with better-than-expected U.S. housing starts, which showed home construction in May rose to the highest level in almost four years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.K., encouraging labor data for May and June lent support, while minutes of the latest Bank of England meeting showed the monetary policy committee is actively considering another interest-rate cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's second testimony before congress proved to be a bit of a damp squib, with market participants pointing out that he didn't offer much in the way of new information. Tuesday, Mr. Bernanke delivered a pretty grim assessment of the U.S. economy, but stopped short of announcing any further stimulus measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In corporate news, Swedish network-equipment vendor <span class="companylink">Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson</span> fell early Wednesday, after posting a bigger-than-expected drop in second-quarter earnings. Ericsson's net profit fell 64% to 1.11 billion Swedish kronor ($159.5 million) from 3.12 billion kronor a year earlier. Still, the shares recovered from early weakness to end up 2.2% following an encouraging conference call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, investment bank <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> added 4.5% after it said second-quarter net profit rose 2.6% from the previous year and that it aims to boost capital by 15.3 billion Swiss francs ($15.7 billion) before the end of 2012.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro held more or less steady against the dollar in Asian trading on Wednesday, but traders say it looks set to fall as news is digested of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's failure to convince investors that additional monetary stimulus measures would be taken anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 0450 GMT, the single currency was at $1.2289 against $1.2293 in New York late Tuesday, according to EBS via CQG. Against the yen, the euro was at Y97.09 versus Y97.23. In New York, the euro briefly fell to $1.2189 before bouncing back as Mr. Bernanke kept the door open to the possibility of a further expansion of the balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market in Asia may not have digested Mr. Bernanke's remarks completely," said Kuniyuki Hirai, manager of the foreign exchange trading department at <span class="companylink">Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi</span> UFJ.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hirai added there could be "more downside risks" for the euro and that it may fall as low as $1.2050 within a week or so as strong hopes for U.S. easing hopes wear off. The single currency had partly been bought on speculation that yield gaps between the U.S. and Europe would narrow if the Fed undertook additional action, Mr. Hirai said. The topside could be limited to as high as $1.2450, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke made the remarks at his semiannual testimony on the economy and monetary policy to the Senate Banking Committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We haven't really come to a specific choice at this point," Mr. Bernanke said, after delivering his testimony. "We are looking for ways to address the weakness in the economy should more action be needed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BTMU's Hirai said Mr. Bernanke is likely to stick to his stance of saving further easing options for a while, perhaps pulling the trigger in September should economic and financial conditions warrant it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial markets in Asia became jittery temporarily after news that North Korea was to make an important announcement at noon (Pyongyang time) without providing any further details. But the market was unfazed after the North's state media reported that North Korean leader Kim Jong Eun has added a new military rank - marshal - to his list of other titles. The news also helped keep the dollar/yen rate rangebound. The greenback was at Y79.06, little changed from New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Junichi Ishikawa, forex analyst at IG Markets Securities in Tokyo, said, however, that buying pressure on the yen may increase if U.S. economic indicators, including housing starts and building permits data for June, as well as some U.S. corporate earnings results later in the global day, show weaker than expected figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pound was at $1.5652 from $1.5642. The ICE Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. dollar against a basket of currencies, was at 83.034 from 82.985.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Yea! Home Prices Hitting Bottom. Now, the Bad News.</span>
</div><div class="author">By Brett Arends   </div><div>1276 words</div><div>14 July 2012</div><div>21:16</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a great time to buy a home in many parts of the country. There are signs that the downward price spiral is bottoming out. Mortgage rates are at historic lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next few years could well be remembered as the best opportunity for Americans to buy homes since the postwar baby boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But one group's opportunity is another group's problem. Tens of millions of baby boomers and other home owners have seen their equity shrunken or wiped out completely. Many were counting on their homes to help finance their retirements. Often they have been waiting for years for the market to turn. Now they find themselves on the short end of the deal, sellers into the buyer's market of the century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a really challenging environment to be a seller," says Lawrence Glazer, wealth adviser at Mayflower Advisors in Boston. "Unfortunately, many people planning to retire may have no choice."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what if you are on the wrong side of the trade? As ever, there isn't a single, simple answer, but if you're in this situation, here's a checklist to help you out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Don't hold your breath.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, house prices nationwide have stabilized. Of the 20 cities tracked by the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller Home Price index, 16 are in the black for this year. But the housing market isn't like the stock market. Bouncebacks are typically slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last crash took more than a decade to work through—and this market could take an especially long time because the huge accumulation of empty, foreclosed houses will hold down prices for all properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When adjusted for inflation, the Case-Shiller index didn't return to its 1989 peak until 2000. Some markets, such as New York and Los Angeles, didn't hit new highs until 2002. This time may be even worse because the bubble was much, much bigger. Some locations may not recover their inflation-adjusted peak in our lifetimes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies calculates that there is a backlog of around two million home loans in foreclosure, waiting to come onto the market. Some estimates put the number much higher, especially when you include "shadow inventory" held back by banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless you are willing to wait for a long time, you may not want to get too hung up waiting for a big rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Look at your local market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the housing market recovers, expect to welcome back the old Realtor's adage: Location, location, location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't expect all markets to rise at the same rate. According to Case-Shiller, Phoenix home prices are up 9% in a year. Meanwhile, Atlanta is down 17% and New York is down 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where will prices go from here? That's likely to depend on two factors: rents and valuations. If it's cheaper to own than to rent, and rents in your neighborhood are rising, you can expect prices to rise in due course. If it's cheaper to rent, or if rents are stagnant, it's another matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Be realistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The true value of your home isn't what you paid or refinanced for in 2006, but what it's worth now. And the true value of your equity isn't what you put into the home, it's what you would get if you sold it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Money spent on that new kitchen? Irrelevant. The pool? Ditto. Too many investors get hung up on past or "sunk" costs. Don't hang around until you "get your money back." That money is gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Know your 'negative equity.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harvard's Joint Center estimates that 11 million American home owners are underwater on their mortgages—in other words, the loan is worth more than the home. Housing-data company Zillow puts the figure closer to 16 million—nearly one mortgage in three.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're in this position, you need to understand your legal status. Home owners who are underwater typically feel they can't sell until they are level again. But that isn't true. Your bank may be willing to accept a "short sale," where you sell for what you can get and they eat the loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In about half of the states, banks can't come after a mortgage borrower for a shortfall. Even in the rest, they can't take what you don't have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are hoping to "get back to even" before selling, you will need to do some basic math. If your home is worth 20% less than the mortgage, you will need a 25% price rise from current levels to break even.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If your home is worth half the mortgage, as is the case in some of the worst-hit areas, you will need prices to double from here. So if you owe $400,000 on your Tampa home but it's only worth $200,000 today, prices would have to rise by 7% a year for 10 years just to get you back to even. How likely is that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, ask yourself: How long are you willing to wait? And how much will it cost you—in time and money—while you do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. Look at your cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forget prices and the market for a moment, and look at your own cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too many investors overcomplicate things. How much is it costing you per month or year to stay in your own home—in terms of mortgage, property taxes, fees, maintenance and other expenses?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates have collapsed to historic levels. Those with good credit can lock in a 30-year loan for less than 4%. As you can take a tax deduction for interest and property taxes, it may be costing you even less than it first appears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, how much would it cost to rent a home instead? If it is cheaper to own, which is true in many places now, it may make sense to hang on and wait for the market to recover. But if it is much cheaper to rent, you may be better off selling at a loss and renting instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. Put your own finances first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smart financial management, like charity, begins at home. Investors need to put more weight on their own financial and personal needs than on national economic or other data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many home owners have put their lives on hold—such as delaying a move to a retirement community or taking a job in another city—as they have waited for a rebound in home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is time lost. It rarely makes sense. Economists would point out that these home owners are ignoring hefty, but invisible, "opportunity costs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are missing out on salaries, investments or life experiences that they otherwise would have enjoyed if they had sold earlier and moved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7. Sell today, buy tomorrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You live in, say, Chicago. You want to retire to, say, San Diego, to be near your children and grandchildren. You've been on hold. Why?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, prices in Chicago are down 36% over the past six years. But San Diego is down 39%. What you lose with one hand, you gain with another. In your new home you may be able to lock in a low fixed-rate mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bottom line? The national housing market may take many years to recover. It's a buyer's market, but home owners hoping to sell need to do their math first.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has turned -- at last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. finally has moved beyond attention-grabbing predictions from housing "experts" that housing is bottoming. The numbers are now convincing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly seven years after the housing bubble burst, most indexes of house prices are bending up. "We finally saw some rising home prices," S&amp;P's David Blitzer said a few weeks ago as he reported the first monthly increase in the slow-moving S&amp;P/Case-Shiller house-price data after seven months of declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 10% more existing homes were sold in May than in May 2011, many purchased by investors who plan to rent them for now and sell them later, an important sign of an inflection point. In something of a surprise, the inventory of existing homes for sale has fallen close to the normal level of six months' worth despite all the foreclosed homes that lenders own. The fraction of homes that are vacant is at its lowest level since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reduced inventory of unsold homes is key, says Mark Fleming, chief economist at <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a housing-data-analysis firm. For the past couple of years, house prices have risen in the spring and then slumped; the declining supply of houses for sale is reason to believe that won't happen again this year, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders began work on 26% more single-family homes in May 2012 than the depressed levels of May 2011. The stock of unsold newly built homes is back to 2005 levels. In each of the past four quarters, housing construction has added to economic growth. In the first quarter, it accounted for 0.4 percentage point of the meager 1.9% growth rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even with the overall economy slowing," <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Securities</span> economists said, cautiously, in a note to clients, "the budding recovery in the housing market appears to be gradually gaining momentum."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists aren't always right, but on this at least they agree: A new Wall Street Journal survey of forecasters found 44 believe the housing market has reached its bottom; only three don't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is still far from healthy despite the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s efforts to resuscitate it by helping to push mortgage rates to extraordinary lows: 3.62% for a 30-year loan, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s latest survey. Single-family housing starts, though up, remain 60% below the 2002 pre-bubble pace. Americans' equity in homes is $2 trillion, or 25%, less than it was in 2002 and half of what it was at the peak. More than one in every four mortgage borrowers still has a loan bigger than the value of the house, though rising home prices are reducing that fraction slowly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the upturn in housing is a milestone, a particularly welcome one amid a distressing dearth of jobs. For some time, housing has been one of the biggest causes of economic weakness. It has now -- barely -- moved to the plus side. "A little tailwind is a lot better than a headwind," says economist Chip Case, the "Case" in Case-Shiller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From here on, housing is unlikely to drag the U.S. economy down further. It will instead reflect the strength or weakness of the overall economy: The more jobs, the more confident Americans are about keeping their jobs, the more they are willing to buy houses. "Manufacturing had led growth and construction had lagged," <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> economists said last week. "Now the roles are reversed: Manufacturing growth has slowed as private construction comes to life."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plenty could go wrong. The biggest threat is a large shadow inventory of unsold homes, homes that owners won't put on the market because they are underwater, homes that will be foreclosed eventually and homes owned by lenders. They have been trickling onto the market, slowed in part by government efforts to delay foreclosures; a flood could reverse the recent rise in prices. Or the still-dysfunctional mortgage market could get worse. Or overly zealous regulators or a postelection change in government policy could unsettle mortgage lenders or home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the housing bust is over.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group AG</span> was among buyers of $828 million worth of mortgage securities left over from the bailout of insurer <span class="companylink">American International Group Inc</span>., according to a person familiar with the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The auctions of collateralized debt obligations and residential mortgage-backed securities were the latest sale from a <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</span> portfolio taken on during the 2008 <span class="companylink">AIG</span> rescue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They bring total sales from the vehicle known as Maiden Lane III to about $27.5 billion in face value this year and reduce the remaining portfolio to about $18.7 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York Fed is taking advantage of demand that has persisted even as concern over global economic growth has steered investors away from many risky assets. The potential for high returns, signs of stability in the housing market and a shrinking supply of securitized assets have spurred interest in the so-called nonagency mortgage sectors that produced steep losses for investors in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The view on housing is that we have bottomed and the worst is over, so that's fundamentally positive" for nonagency bonds, or those that don't carry any federal backing, said John Sim, a mortgage-bond strategist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. Furthermore, "there are just not many bonds out there with yields like nonagencies," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales from Maiden Lane III and two similar crisis-era portfolios have already led to the full payoff of more than $70 billion in loans made by the New York Fed. A New York Fed spokeswoman didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> expects U.S. home prices will post a 1.6% drop in 2012 and then rise by 1.4% in 2013, 3.7% in 2014, and 4.4% in 2015, as demand is predicted to begin to match the supply of homes for sale for the first time since 2007. Falling home prices reduce the amount an investor can get if a defaulted loan results in foreclosure and sale of the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices on some nonagency mortgages that posted double-digit losses in 2011 have gained 15% or more this year. Bonds backed by so-called option adjustable-rate mortgages—one of the riskier types of nonagency bonds—in June traded at 49 cents on the dollar, up from 42.5 cents on the dollar in December, according to <span class="companylink">Amherst Securities Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ABX indexes of subprime mortgage bonds are also at their highest levels in more than a year, according to Markit.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown and Craig Karmin </div><div>915 words</div><div>11 July 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> is preparing to unload its portfolio of U.S. office buildings, a move that would signal that one of the property sector's most active buyers is moving into a selling phase as top office markets recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> is leaning toward selling the portfolio, which analysts have valued as high as $22 billion, in regional parcels, according to real-estate executives who have discussed the matter with the firm. Firm officials also are considering listing it as a real-estate investment trust, the executives said, but that would mean taking it public at a time of tepid investor appetite for such offerings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> has begun pruning the office portfolio with an eye toward readying it for an exit that could come as early as next year, according to people with knowledge of the process. The firm hasn't begun negotiations on bulk deals with any specific buyers, the people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York firm's plan to sell its office empire -- which totals more than 100 buildings and some 50 million square feet of space, greater than Houston's entire downtown office market -- is driven by several factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It needs to sell, in part, to return money to investors in funds that typically liquidate after seven to 10 years. <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s thinking also is being shaped by strong demand from pension funds and other institutional investors for the type of well-located, mostly leased office buildings that <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> owns, the people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> built the portfolio mostly in three transactions before the downturn in 2006 and 2007 with a value of $48 billion, including the leveraged buyout of <span class="companylink">Equity Office Properties Trust</span> for $39 billion. The firm quickly sold or "flipped" for a profit many of the buildings for $36 billion. If it sells the remaining properties -- largely in Northern California, Boston, New York and West Los Angeles -- for, say, $20 billion, <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> would bring in $8 billion more than it paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company doesn't publicize the value of its property portfolio, but it isn't shy about boasting how it will make money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When we exit the real estate, my expectation is that we will really crush it and we will really do extremely well," Stephen Schwarzman, <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s chief executive, said on a call with analysts in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the price the office buildings fetch depends partly on the direction of the overall economy. Office occupancies and rents have been creeping up, but that growth may stall if businesses don't start adding jobs at a faster rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office building values also have surged partly because of low interest rates, which make their yields attractive compared with bonds. If rates rise, prices may fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> has emerged as one of the biggest property buyers in the world, and commercial property has become critical to its overall business. In 2011, real estate contributed $1 billion toward the private-equity firm's $1.6 billion in pretax economic net income, a measure of profitability, according to securities filings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, Jonathan Gray, <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s head of real estate, was named to the firm's board. The firm has raised more than $23 billion for its last two real-estate funds, and it would set a record if, as expected, the latest fund closes this year with about $13 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, even as it continues to buy, <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> is poised to be among the market's most active sellers as it starts to unwind some of those holdings. While the office-building portfolio could go first, other big deals are likely to follow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm controls 80 million square feet of industrial property, one of the largest portfolios of its kind, and owns about 185,000 hotel rooms in the U.S., including the Hilton chain, more than any other hotel owner. It also has a sizable retail footprint, anchored by its 2011 acquisition of nearly 600 U.S. shopping centers from Australia's Centro Properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would-be buyers of <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s assets have been circling. Jordan Kaplan, chief executive of real-estate firm <span class="companylink">Douglas Emmett Inc</span>., has for years coveted <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s office holdings in West Los Angeles. He called them one of the "career acquisitions" he felt he "needed to make" on a 2010 analyst conference call, according to a transcript.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked when he would buy it, Mr. Kaplan said analysts should ask Mr. Gray, <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s real-estate chief. "Believe me, I ask him every month," Mr. Kaplan said at the time. Mr. Kaplan declined to comment through a spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before selling, the private-equity firm is simplifying its holdings, shedding assets out of step with the rest of the portfolio. <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> is marketing three groups of older suburban office buildings in Northern California, and it agreed last week to sell its 50% stake in 1411 Broadway, a Manhattan building in the Times Square area, said people who have been briefed on the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investor close to buying <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s 50% stake in 1411 Broadway is Canadian pension investor <span class="companylink">Ivanhoe Cambridge</span>, according to people briefed on the deal. <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> is being advised by real-estate-services firm Eastdil Secured. The proposed transaction values the building at about $735 million, these people said. Ivanhoe declined to comment.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jane Hodges  </div><div>898 words</div><div>9 July 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>R9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's something that might surprise you: Despite all of the doom and gloom surrounding real estate in recent years, funds focused on U.S. real-estate securities have performed exceedingly well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such funds trumped all other categories of stock funds over the three years through June, returning an average 31.4% annually, including 14.2% so far this year, according to <span class="companylink">Morningstar Inc</span>. Global real estate also has fared well, if less spectacularly, with a three-year average of 16%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But whether investors need real-estate-specific mutual funds and exchange-traded funds in their portfolios remains a topic of debate among investors and advisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors should understand that real-estate funds' "explosive returns aren't the result of positive fundamentals performance," says Abraham Bailin, an ETF analyst at Morningstar. Rather, they are "the result of an asset class that was priced for bankruptcy not doing so," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who favor real estate for diversification cite its reputation for being countercyclical, meaning it tends to move in the opposite direction of other stock sectors. "In volatile periods, people run to real estate," says Mitch Roschelle, who oversees the U.S. real-estate advisory practice at <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span>, or PwC. "Real estate generates income from contracts and leases. That's considered more reliable to some people than income from sales at other types of businesses."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Morningstar's Mr. Bailin says real estate's diversification benefits aren't as noticeable as they were 10 years ago. Since 2001, major real-estate stocks have been eligible for inclusion in widely followed indexes such as the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index, which leads to closer correlation with the broader equity market, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elliott Orsillo, an adviser with Colorado Springs, Colo.-based Season Investments LLC, agrees that investors who want diversification from the broader equity market won't necessarily get it via real estate. What they might get is more risk. The standard deviation, a statistical measure of volatility, for <span class="companylink">Vanguard</span> REIT Index ETF, the largest real-estate ETF, is 33.4 over five years through June, compared with 19.1 for the S&amp;P 500, according to Morningstar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally, real-estate funds and ETFs own shares of real-estate investment trusts, or REITs, which operate commercial assets such as hotels, retail properties, medical and office buildings, industrial properties and apartment complexes. In a tough period for single-family housing, multifamily housing has benefited from shrinking vacancies as more people rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, PwC research from the first quarter estimates that many commercial sectors, such as industrial and super-regional shopping malls, are beginning to recover from the recession. Mr. Roschelle calls real estate a "relatively safe" investment over the long term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adam Koos, a financial planner who owns Libertas Wealth Management Group Inc. in Columbus, Ohio, is bullish on real estate because as a sector it "is correlated to population growth." Whether retailers need warehouses to store goods this population buys, or urban areas need more office space for future workers, or seniors need places to retire or seek medical care, the demand for such space likely won't stall, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Hammer, president of Hammer Wealth Group in Melville, N.Y., says real estate can provide a yield resembling fixed-income products but additionally high potential returns the way that traditional equities do. "I'd much rather have a lot of money in REITs than bonds right now," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hammer says a typical investor with a 60%-40% mix of stocks and bonds might be wise to move to a mix of 60% equities, 5% to 10% real estate, and 30% to 35% bonds. He puts real estate in between equities and fixed income in terms of risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For investors interested in putting some commercial bricks and mortar into their portfolios, there are plenty of fund options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rob Wherry, a mutual-fund analyst at Morningstar, notes that blue-chip REITs such as mall operator <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group Inc</span>. and apartment operator <span class="companylink">AvalonBay Communities Inc</span>. are common holdings. "There are only subtle differences in weightings among funds," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Vanguard</span> REIT Index ETF is a popular pick among many advisers, given its low annual fees of 0.10% of assets and diverse basket of apartment, office, retail and other holdings. <span class="companylink">T. Rowe Price Real Estate</span>, with a 0.78% expense ratio, is a good, inexpensive option among actively managed funds, Mr. Wherry says. That fund's long-standing management team has delivered an 11% annualized return over the past decade, versus 9.4% for the average peer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Koos favors iShares FTSE NAREIT Industrial/Office Capped Index -- a choice reflecting his bullishness on the industrial real-estate market, which includes warehouses and storage. Another ETF pick is <span class="companylink">iShares Cohen &amp; Steers Realty Majors</span>, which includes a wide variety of REITs across all commercial categories. Internationally, he recommends iShares FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed Real Estate Ex-U.S. Index, with assets in Hong Kong, Japan, Australia, Canada and the U.K.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>729 words</div><div>6 July 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Masco Corp</span>. has long been the 800-pound gorilla in the business of installing insulation in new American homes. Now a federal court is due to examine whether the company abused its dominance of that market, in a case that may help clarify how far companies can go in seeking advantages over their rivals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After eight years of legal jousting, a class-action antitrust lawsuit against <span class="companylink">Masco</span> is due to go to trial at U.S. district court in Atlanta July 23. Nearly 370 companies that install insulation in homes accuse <span class="companylink">Masco</span> of having conspired with makers of fiberglass insulation between 1999 and 2003 to ensure that other installers paid much more than <span class="companylink">Masco</span> for the material. The suit argues that <span class="companylink">Masco</span> agreed to accept price increases so long as the manufacturers charged other installers even more when prices went higher, preserving <span class="companylink">Masco</span>'s cost advantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Antitrust cases often involve claims that a group of sellers colluded to fix prices. The <span class="companylink">Masco</span> case is a less-usual type of case in which a buyer is accused of conspiring with the sellers to set prices in a way that reduced competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The insulation installers, which are regional or local firms, are seeking about $250 million in damages, according to their attorney, Steven Rosenwasser of <span class="companylink">Bondurant Mixson &amp; Elmore LLP</span> in Atlanta. Under antitrust law, any damages awarded are automatically tripled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four makers of insulation -- <span class="companylink">Johns Manville</span>, <span class="companylink">CertainTeed Corp</span>., Knauf Insulation GmbH and <span class="companylink">Guardian Fiberglass Inc</span>. -- that were also named in the suit against <span class="companylink">Masco</span> agreed to pay a total of $37.25 million to settle claims made by the insulation installers. That settlement was approved by U.S. District Judge Julie Carnes in Atlanta in 2008. All four companies declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Masco spokeswoman said that the allegations are "baseless" and that the Taylor, Mich., company "intends to continue to defend itself vigorously." In a recent securities filing, <span class="companylink">Masco</span> said it can't "reliably estimate" the damages that could result from an adverse ruling in the case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Molly Boast, a partner at the law firm <span class="companylink">Wilmer Hale</span> in New York who until last year was a senior antitrust official at the Justice Department, said arrangements giving big buyers of a product or service "most-favored" status are common and "not automatically illegal." An antitrust problem could occur if a dominant customer seeks specific pricing advantages over smaller rivals in ways that reduce competition, she said, or if the arrangements facilitate price-fixing deals among the suppliers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Masco</span> is best known for making such household products as Behr paint, KraftMaid cabinets and Brizo faucets. But it is also the nation's biggest installer of insulation made by other companies in new homes. Its market share at various times has been estimated at 40% to 60%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to a request by <span class="companylink">Masco</span> that the case be dismissed, Judge Carnes ruled in 2009 that it should proceed, citing a June 2002 email from a CertainTeed executive stating that "what we really need is to convince them [<span class="companylink">Masco</span>] that they can lead the industry in getting pricing up in the market if we commit to a reasonable gap" between what <span class="companylink">Masco</span> and its rivals would pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The judge also pointed to evidence in documents obtained from one of the manufacturers that other installers were required by the alleged agreement between <span class="companylink">Masco</span> and the manufacturers to pay 12% to 15% more than <span class="companylink">Masco</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The class-action suit alleges <span class="companylink">Masco</span> "served as a conduit" through which the manufacturers could exchange information about pricing. A 2001 email from a CertainTeed executive, cited by the judge, instructed a subordinate to tell a <span class="companylink">Masco</span> executive that <span class="companylink">Johns Manville</span> had cut its price charged to a rival to "within a smidge of the <span class="companylink">Masco</span> price." The email added that CertainTeed might need <span class="companylink">Masco</span>'s help "to send [<span class="companylink">Johns Manville</span>] the correct message" about pricing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, installation and distribution of insulation and other building products produced revenue of $1.08 billion for the company, or 14% of <span class="companylink">Masco</span>'s total sales. But the six-year-old housing bust has devastated the installation business; <span class="companylink">Masco</span>'s installation revenue last year was about a third of the 2006 peak, and <span class="companylink">Masco</span> has been reporting operating losses on installation since 2009.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Dawn Wotapka   </div><div>729 words</div><div>5 July 2012</div><div>00:35</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords boosted apartment rents to record levels in the second quarter as demand from tenants sitting out the home-buying market pushed vacancy rates to their lowest point in more than a decade, according to a report to be released Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the sluggish economy, average rents increased in all 82 markets tracked by <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a real estate data firm. Average rents are now at record levels in 74 of those markets and now top $1,000 a month on average in 27 of them, including Miami, Seattle, San Diego, Chicago and Baltimore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest rent boost of the second quarter was in New York City, where the average rose to $2,935 per month, up 1.7% from the first quarter. Apartment rents also increased in markets that have been hard hit by the economic downturn such as Las Vegas and Phoenix, where they rose 0.9% and 1% respectively in the second quarter. The lowest average rent among the markets surveyed was Wichita, Kan., where the average was $510 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is in a very tight position," Reis said in a research report. "There is a paucity of available units."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's vacancy rate fell during the quarter to 4.7%, its lowest level since the end of 2001, Reis said. That's down from 4.9% in the first quarter of this year and from 8% in 2009, when millions of would-be renters were doubling up or living with family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the economy slowly recovering, more people are looking for their own places. But many are opting to rent rather than buy due to tighter lending standards—including higher down payments—and because of concerns about job security.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market psychology also has shifted greatly from the boom years, when buyers were concerned that prices would rise if they didn't move fast. Today prices are stagnating—or even falling in some markets—so buyers are asking: what's the hurry?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm just not ready for those roots yet," said Tiffanie Salisbury, who is looking for a rental in Atlantic Highlands, NJ., hoping to pay about $1,100 a month. "I'm 31, and I don't know where life's going to take me."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reis said that this is only the third quarter in over three decades that the vacancy rate has been below 5%. When vacancies fall to this level, landlords typically accelerate rent increases "and that is exactly what is transpiring," the Reis report states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it's not likely to stop soon. Rents could "spike as landlords perceive that tight market conditions afford them greater pricing power over tenants," Reis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Values of apartment buildings are soaring, contrasting sharply with the single-family housing market. In some cities, investors are now surpassing peak prices for rental property buildings. "We continue to be optimistic in both the near and long term for apartments," said Scott Anderson, senior director of global real-estate asset management with <span class="companylink">TIAA-CREF</span>, which spent $800 million on apartments last year and could spend more this year. "All of the underlying demand drivers are positive. The supply and demand equilibrium is in a good place. Rents are moving in the right direction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts point out that the apartment sector may lose steam if the economy weakens further and tenants begin doubling up again or put up more resistance to rent hikes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for rental apartments also may fall if some builders succeed with appeals to move renters into the market for single family homes. Home builders have begun marketing to renters: <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>., one of the nation's largest publicly held builders, recently introduced a line of homes marketed as being more affordable than some monthly rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another risk: construction. Developers are racing to deliver new apartment supply, particularly in hot markets including Washington, D.C, and Seattle. Zelman &amp; Associates expects 235,000 units to be started this year, followed by 285,000 in 2013and 320,000 in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should too many units flood the market, landlords could be forced to offer concessions to fill units, such as free rent or a flat-screen televisions. Construction is "a wild card, definitely," says Luis Mejia, the CoStar Group's director of multifamily research.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With continued economic turbulence in the euro zone and lackluster performance elsewhere in Europe, the search for investment havens has alighted on an unlikely asset class: hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The European hotel industry may be sensitive to economic fluctuations, but hotel values, which suffered less during the 2008-2009 financial crisis than those of shops or offices, have recovered and investors now appreciate the sector's resilience and cash generation, industry experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the euro has slipped in value against other major currencies amid the economic woes, the euro area has become attractive as a holiday destination for Asians and Americans, boosting occupancy rates and the market for hotel real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hotel property transactions in Europe, the Middle East and Africa reached 8.94 billion euros ($11.24 billion) in 2011, up 14% from the previous year, according to property-services company <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. That is well below the 21.37 billion euros in 2007 but up from 3.3 billion euros in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And 2012 is likely to be even stronger, <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> said. Four-star hotels accounted for 45% of the 2.5 billion euros in transactions in the first quarter of this year, compared with 27% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is some skepticism about how long the trend will continue. Some market-watchers expect distressed sales to cause the market to soften again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many assets will need to be refinanced this year or next, but financing is still hard to come by and virtually unobtainable in the secondary market, defined as lower-quality properties in good locations. The number of buildings for sale is likely to increase, while closing those sales will become more difficult, industry experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But despite the debt crisis, economic contraction in many European Union countries and instability in the European banking system, experts at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> say confidence in the hotel real-estate sector has risen since October 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The growing desire for diversification has led to a large upsurge in interest in the European hotel sector," says Gael Le Lay, head of hotel investment at insurer AXA Real Estate Investment Managers, which has 42 billion euros in assets under management. Both private and institutional investors are keen to buy into hotel real estate, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Le Lay manages a 2 billion euro hotel portfolio, with some 100 hotels, for AXA's customers and aims to add 1 billion euros in assets within two to three years, mainly focusing on major European cities, especially in France and Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-equity giant <span class="companylink">Carlyle Group</span>, owner of budget hotel chain B&amp;B -- which has 197 hotels in France, 44 in Germany and several in Poland and Italy -- plans to add 20 to 25 hotels a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The budget hotel industry is very stable and demand holds up in a crisis," says Olivier Petreschi, director at the <span class="companylink">Carlyle Group</span>. "People trade down in a crisis and choose the three- to four-star hotels, as opposed to the five-star, and budget hotels as opposed to three- to four-star hotels, so budget and quality hotels will always have customers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sentiment is echoed by Jochen Schafer-Suren, head of hotels and leisure at 2.1 billion euro property fund Internos. "Quality three- to four-star business hotels provide the perfect combination of real-estate investment-- as they usually are in good locations -- and operating business," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schafer-Suren recently bought three four-star hotels, including the Lindner Hotel in Frankfurt and the Park Inn in Nuremberg, as well as one in Amsterdam for a total of more than 100 million euros.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While European capitals such as Paris and London are popular and five-star hotels top investors' wish lists, not many can afford them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Competing with international buyers in the luxury bracket is virtually impossible and not financially viable," Mr. Schafer-Suren says. "Buyers from Russia or the Middle East, whose priority is capital preservation and not profit, often snatch trophy assets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first quarter, a Middle Eastern investor bought six <span class="companylink">InterContinental Hotels</span> in major European cities including Amsterdam, Rome and Cannes, while the <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> in Vienna has been acquired by Verny Investment, a company backed by Kazakh billionaire Bulat Utemuratov, who also bought the <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> in Moscow last year for 411 million euros.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Investors Downshift on Real-Estate Stocks --- REITs Return 4% in Second Quarter, a Sharp Drop From Prior Period; Health Care Bucks the Trend With 10% Return</span>
</div><div class="author">By A.D. Pruitt </div><div>799 words</div><div>3 July 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate stocks that were hot at the start of the year lost some steam during the spring, an indication of growing volatility in property stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones All REIT Equity Index, which tracks the stocks of 133 real-estate investment trusts, delivered a total return of 4% in the second quarter. That was down sharply from a total return of 10.5% in the first quarter and 15% in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs were poised to end the second quarter relatively flat until a last-minute stock-market rally on Friday -- ignited after European leaders agreed on a plan to bolster support for troubled banks -- allowed the REIT index to end the quarter with a modest gain and a stronger overall finish than the broader stock market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs generally outpaced broader equities over the past 2 1/2 years because commercial real estate is considered less risky and more stable that other assets classes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some REIT sectors that had been stock-market darlings in recent years -- apartments, hotels and industrials -- lost favor in the second quarter on concerns that rent and occupancy growth won't rise as sharply as anticipated if the economy continues to slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors also worry that Europe's financial problems could trigger another credit crunch in the U.S., making it more difficult for landlords to borrow capital for acquisitions and to reduce debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Fear of either [debt or equity markets] closing is what's causing the volatility," said Jay Leupp, a portfolio manager at <span class="companylink">Lazard Asset Management LLC</span>. "Continued access to both . . . for public REITs is very important."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest backsliders in the second quarter were industrial REITs, which posted a negative return of 1.46%, compared with a positive return of 19.8% in the first quarter. Analysts say the sector, which rents warehouses to a wide variety of national retailers, food companies and manufacturers, was dragged down by mainly by one company: San Francisco-based <span class="companylink">Prologis Inc</span>., which is more than 10 times the size of the other six pure warehouse REITs and has warehouses around the world, including Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No other company has that degree of exposure to overseas markets, in particular Europe," said David Harris, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Imperial Capital LLC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prologis Co-Chief Executive Hamid Moghadam acknowledged that because 26% of the company's net asset value comes from European assets and it has the largest exposure to the Continent among U.S. REITs, it has become "the poster child" for Europe. But, he added, "over time, our exposure will be the cause for the outperformance of the company."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment REITs also lost steam in the second quarter as investors grew concerned that multifamily landlords won't be able to push through aggressive rent increases in the future if the economy remains sluggish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment sector delivered a total return of 0.91% during the second quarter, compared with 8.6% in the prior quarter. The sector had been one of the top performing REIT sectors for the past few years, benefiting from large numbers of former homeowners who returned to renting and young professionals who either can't qualify to buy their first home or don't want to own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But rent growth is starting to slow, according to Hessam Nadji of Marcus &amp; Millichap, adding that stagnant wages are part of the problem. "Wages are not quite keeping up with rent growth," he said. Mr. Nadji also said that new apartment supply is competing with existing rentals in the high-end segment, and a slight pickup in home buying is adding to concerns about more competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hotels slipped back into negative terrain as investors fretted that an economic slowdown would cause a cutback in corporate leisure travel. The sector's total return was negative 0.58% in the second quarter, compared with 13.5% in the first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office REITs lost momentum as many landlords of suburban buildings struggled to fill vacant space as corporations slow expansion plans or opt for space in metropolitan areas. Office REITs returned 2.56%, compared with 9.8% in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As investors shied away from sectors they feel are at most economic risk, they returned to stocks that are considered more immune to economic swings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health-care REITs were at the top of the heap in the second quarter, with a total return of 10%. Investors also anticipate that health-care landlords will benefit from a rising number of insured patients after the Supreme Court upheld the Obama administration's health-care law.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lauren A.E. Schuker   </div><div>2195 words</div><div>29 June 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Asia</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>W1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new wave of buyers from China is snapping up luxury properties across the U.S., injecting billions of dollars into the country's residential-real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry is scrambling to court the new buyers. Some developers of new projects are installing wok kitchens, following feng shui principles and putting lucky numbers on choice units; others are packaging property sales with government programs designed to encourage foreign investment. Real-estate agencies are flying representatives to China, and hiring Mandarin-speaking agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Angeles, New York and even Miami, buyers mostly from China -- and some are from Hong Kong, Singapore and Korea -- are radically altering the landscape. Last month, a Chinese couple paid $34.5 million for a Versailles-style mansion on Sunset Boulevard in Beverly Hills, Calif. A year earlier, a Hong Kong businessman paid around $28 million for a nearby estate. Over the last six months in New York, several full-floor apartments in a new Manhattan high-rise called One57, each with a price tag of roughly $50 million, have gone into contract with Chinese buyers, according to two people close to the situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a nod to Asian buyers, the building put many of its most luxurious full-floor apartments on the 80th through 88th floors -- a way to appeal to the Chinese belief that eight is the luckiest number. Apartment 88 is under contract to a Chinese buyer for around $50 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifteen buyers from Asia have bought roughly $1 million apartments at New York's 515 E. 72nd St. in the last six months. In downtown Los Angeles, half of recent buyers for the new <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> Residences, which AEG developed, hail from Asia. Some buy in bulk: Late last year, Fang Yi Liu, a businessman from Shanghai, snapped up 17 apartments for a total of $14 million in the Artech, a modern glass building resembling a cruise ship that overlooks the Intracoastal Waterway near Miami.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest is surging even in parts of the country China-based buyers weren't traditionally interested in. Richard Zhou, a 41-year-old investment advisor who lives in Shanghai, paid $200,000 for a home in a large golf community in Fort Myers, Fla., last year. He said he bought in the community sight-unseen, trusting his friend who had bought a home there a few months earlier. Mr. Zhou spent two weeks studying the U.S. real-estate market and quickly decided Florida was a good bet because "it was highly impacted from the financial crisis," adding that later in his life he plans to retire there. "Florida is indeed a sunshine state, the weather is really pleasant, and the air quality is very good. Also, the food is safe, too."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers from China and Hong Kong accounted for $9 billion of U.S. home sales in the 12 months ending in March, up 89% from 2010, making them the second-largest group of foreign buyers of homes in the U.S. behind Canadians, according to data released earlier this month by the National Association of Realtors. And many real-estate agents say the those figures are too low, as they track only sales on the multiple-listing service and don't reflect private sales. In addition, the data are based entirely on how real-estate agents classify buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I. Dolly Lenz, a luxury-real-estate broker in New York, estimates that half of her clients now hail from China, more than twice the amount two years ago. Pamela Liebman, chief executive of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, says that the shopping for luxury properties by China-based buyers has accelerated dramatically since the start of 2012 to record-breaking levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign-investor interest in the U.S. real-estate market began during the housing crisis, when plummeting property prices turned the U.S. into an attractive target for buyers around the world. The yuan has continued to rise -- more than 7% against the dollar since June 2010 -- as has the number of China's wealthiest individuals. Meanwhile, in an effort to deflate China's housing bubble, the government has placed restrictions on multiple real-estate purchases and recently began to require more equity for mortgage loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Because it's becoming more restrictive to invest at home and because Europe is so unstable, the U.S. property market is becoming incredibly attractive to the Chinese," says Patrick O'Neill, whose eponymous company in Hong Kong helps Asian investors buy real estate in the U.S. "America offers low interest rates, discounted prices and a safe harbor for their money."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Di Meng, a native of Changchun who lives in Beijing, is currently attending the University of Southern California. The 23-year-old says the volatility of the Chinese government and, consequently, its economy, pushed him to invest in real estate overseas. Not keen to rent student housing, he recently paid around $800,000 for a <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> condo in downtown Los Angeles. "Compared to China, the United States is relatively stable," he says. "China has a purchase limit policy because the Chinese government tried to control and cool down the housing market in China, so if you've already bought a home in China, they do not support you to buy another."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last six months, 10 to 15 pricey units in One57, a glitzy new high-rise being built in midtown Manhattan, went into contract with wealthy Chinese buyers. When completed, the building -- which features a Park Hyatt below the condo units -- will be New York's tallest residential building. <span class="companylink">HNA Group</span>, one of China's largest conglomerates that recently bought several commercial properties in New York, signed contracts for two full-floor apartments and two half-floor units in One57, according to a person close to the situation. On West 57th Street across from Carnegie Hall, overlooking Central Park, the building is slated to open in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents typically divide buyers into four distinct groups: the super-wealthy buying properties upward of $15 million for personal use; those buying homes for a few million dollars, also for personal use; those purchasing investment properties, usually in the $1 million to $2 million range, to lease out; and those buying in bulk, as a commercial strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Loh, a businessman from Singapore who runs a real-estate advisory group called Silkrouteasia Capital Partners, is a bulk buyer. He recently purchased six apartments in Los Angeles's <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> Residences for about $1 million each and is also facilitating a $60 million transaction with several overseas investors to buy more than 50 condos in another Los Angeles development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Loh says he wanted to get a jump on the market before property values rise. He isn't worried about Americans -- he thinks it will be other Asian-based buyers and businesses who drive up prices, so he is courting them now to invest in the deals he's striking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I believe there is a strong desire among Asian high-net-worth individuals to allocate, say, 10% to 25% of their wealth to U.S. assets," he says. "Asians have a high propensity and love for acquiring good quality real estate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some U.S. real-estate agents say that the current property craze reminds them of the real-estate shopping spree by the Japanese in the 1980s, a phenomenon that died with the collapse of Japan's economy. Unlike those days, buyers now tend to be a little more cautious, trying to avoid paying above market value and obsessively calculating rates of return. In addition, while borrowing drove many of the Japanese investments in prior decades, Chinese buyers tend to pay in cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many investors from Asian countries, buyers from China mostly want new construction. At Lambert Ranch, a gated development so new in Irvine, Calif., that the leaves on the palm trees haven't yet unfurled, buyers are lining up to buy homes asking between $900,000 to $1.5 million, says Mei Zhou, a Mandarin-speaking real-estate agent in Irvine who uses Skype to communicate with her clients in Asia. About 50% of Lambert's buyers so far are foreigners from Asia, say people close to the community. The development's first 42 available homes sold out in five weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents say that while Chinese investors primarily target New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, they are beginning to expand into cities in southern Florida as well as outposts such as Seattle and Las Vegas. That's a big change from a few years ago, when they were "fearful" of Florida, says Steven Lawson, chief executive of Windham China, a Shanghai-based company that helps find Chinese buyers property in the U.S. "There was a false perception in China that Miami is not a supersafe city because a lot of Chinese watch 'CSI: Miami' or 'Miami Vice' on TV."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year, Mr. Lawson says he sold about eight homes in a large golf community in Fort Myers to Chinese buyers. The houses, which span about 2,500 square feet and come fully decorated, cost less than $250,000 -- a bargain to Beijing and Shanghai residents used to adding another zero to buy a home of that size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agencies and banks are mobilizing to capitalize on the boom. Mr. O'Neill says demand for his company's semiannual investment seminar, which teaches prequalified buyers in China about how real-estate buying works in the U.S. and is held in ballrooms and private clubs, has doubled over the last six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some developers and real-estate agents are trying to capitalize on government programs that encourage foreigners to invest in the U.S. For example, the EB-5 program makes foreign investors eligible for permanent U.S. residency in exchange for investing at least $500,000 in ventures that create at least 10 jobs in the U.S. Jerry Kaufman, a developer at J. Milton &amp; Associates in Miami, pitches a package to the Chinese where they can invest in an EB-5 approved investment vehicle called the Atlantic American Opportunities Fund in Florida -- and then spend more to buy a condo in J. Milton's nearby development, the St. Tropez, in Sunny Isles Beach near Miami. So far, he says, he has signed up 20 Chinese families to invest in the fund and buy units in the condo building, which sell for an average of $700,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kaufman is currently in negotiations to buy a 40-hectare plot of land north of Miami in an effort to create Miami's first Chinatown, a free-trade zone with casinos, restaurants, shopping and hotels. "We'd call it New China," he says. Others are taking quicker routes: In recent months, Corcoran's Ms. Liebman has started regularly sending four of her agents to China, forged partnerships with three real-estate companies there and hired several Mandarin-speaking agents in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With options like wok kitchens or a guest unit for a grandparent, California's Lambert Ranch was designed from the start with the Asia-based buyer in mind. Robert Hidey, Lambert Ranch's architect, who has designed extensively in China, built the community's main roads on a north-south axis and ensured the homes had south-facing windows -- both pillars of good feng shui. In addition to creating multigenerational housing options and wok kitchens, the New Home Co., which developed Lambert Ranch, also buried gold coins on the property in accordance with feng shui principles. To avoid having any addresses starting with the number four, unlucky in China, the development starts its addresses at 50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Angeles, brokers for the <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> Residences have been inviting buyers in China to stay for two nights free as part of the Ritz's broader strategy to appeal to Asian buyers, called the "Pacific Rim Plan." The visit concludes with a Champagne toast in one of the Ritz residences, although guests must pay their own airfare. "All we do now is visit China, Hong Kong and Singapore," says Jim Jacobson, who runs international sales for the <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> Residences. "We've realized that's where our market lies." The <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> Residences range from one-bedroom condos costing around $850,000 to larger ones priced at $2.5 million to penthouses, which top out at $9.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others are simply turning to Chinese media to market themselves -- and their wares. Jing Chen, a broker for Corcoran in New York, writes a column in Mandarin for a popular Chinese website, Sinovision.net. Last year, she wrote a column about Harlem brownstones gaining in value; eight months later, she sold three of them to Chinese buyers, each for somewhere between $1 million and $2 million apiece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Chinese are like Hollywood celebrities," she says. "Once one Chinese person buys a brownstone, they all want one."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European stock markets broke a four-day losing streak Wednesday, as buoyant U.S. housing data cheered investors, although the focus remained on the Thursday start of the European Union summit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stoxx Europe 600 index jumped 1.4% to 245.87, after falling in recent days as investor hopes faded that European leaders will agree on measures to contain the region's crisis when they meet Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European shares got a late-session boost from the U.S., where pending home sales climbed to the highest level in two years in May. The index of pending sales of existing homes rose 5.9% from April, better than economists' expectations of a 2.3% gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The positive U.S. data also helped shares on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tacked on 92.26 points, or 0.7%, to finish at 12626.93. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index rose 11.86 points, or 0.9%, to 1331.85, and the Nasdaq Composite added 21.26 points, or 0.7%, to 2875.32. Oil stocks were higher on strength in crude prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe's Stoxx 600 banks index finished up 2.5%, getting a boost as the Eurogroup set out initial aid plans for Spain and Cyprus, the latest casualties from the euro zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eurogroup finance ministers said in a statement that the Spanish government remains fully liable for the 100 billion euros ($125 billion) it requested to help boost its ailing banking sector and will be expected to honor its reform and deficit targets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financial rescue package for Cyprus will involve the European Union, European Central Bank and <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> and will be tied to strict conditions on fiscal policy, bank deleveraging and structural reforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spain's IBEX-35 index rose 2.1% to 6666.90, while Greece's ASE Composite finished up 0.7% at 579.69.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Italy, the FTSE MIB index rallied 2.6% to 13302.77, shrugging off results from a closely watched government debt auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Italy's treasury managed to sell the planned 9 billion euros ($11.2 billion) of six-month Treasury bills, but at sharply higher yields, suggesting that a longer-term bond sale on Thursday could be an expensive affair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.K.'s FTSE 100 finished up 1.4% at 5523.92, helped by positive retail data. According to the <span class="companylink">Confederation of British Industry</span>, there was a sharp rise in retail sales in June, largely as a result of celebrations over the Diamond Jubilee weekend. The business group said 58% of retailers surveyed reported a rise in sales compared with a year earlier, while 17% reported a fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany's DAX closed 1.5% higher at 6228.99, while France's CAC-40 increased 1.7% to 3063.12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Better-than-expected U.S. durable-goods orders and pending home sales also helped the mood across Europe as well as news that China could implement more proactive policies to shore up growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro slipped to $1.2462 in late New York trade from 1.2496 Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil futures gained 85 cents, or 1.1%, to $80.21 on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>. Gold futures gained $3.50, or 0.2%, to $1577.50 on Nymex's Comex division.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among individual stocks, <span class="companylink">UniCredit</span> surged 4.7% as concerns about the Italian banking sector eased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In London, <span class="companylink">Glencore</span> shares fell 1.5% after sovereign-wealth fund <span class="companylink">Qatar Holding</span>, which has a substantial stake in <span class="companylink">Xstrata</span>, called on <span class="companylink">Glencore</span> to sweeten the terms of its merger proposal for <span class="companylink">Xstrata</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankia surged 6.9% in Madrid after the European Commission temporarily approved assistance from the Spanish state to BFA group and its subsidiary Bankia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major drug makers helped boost the pan-European index. <span class="companylink">Novo Nordisk</span> rose 1.5%, Sanofi ticked 1.3% higher and <span class="companylink">Novartis</span> added 1.1%.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-sales data released Wednesday provided fresh support for the view that the strong start to the spring home-buying season marks the beginning of a recovery, not a temporary blip due to an unusually warm winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index that measures the number of contracts signed to purchase previously owned homes rose in May to match its March level, which was the highest point in nearly two years. Pending home sales rose 5.9% from April and stood 13.3% above year-ago levels, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May's reading showed strength in every part of the U.S. Contract activity stood at its highest level in more than one year in the Northeast, which was up 19.8% from last year, and the Midwest, which was up 22.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pending home-sales report was the strongest for the month of May since 2006, when the housing bubble peaked. Since 2007, contract activity has been stronger only in five other months -- three in 2009 and two in 2010 -- all in periods when federal tax credits fueled sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, contract activity has been a less-reliable indicator of future sales activity than it was because many deals fall through, either because buyers can't qualify for mortgages or because appraisals are too low. Also, some sellers need bank approval to complete a short sale, where the bank allows the home to sell for less than the amount owed. Still, a growing number of economists say that recent housing indicators point to a market that is recovering. Dean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research who has long maintained a bearish outlook on housing, on Tuesday wrote that the sector "has hit bottom and started an upswing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some homebuilders are sounding optimistic. <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., the Miami-based builder, reported a sharply higher profit for the quarter ending May 31, buoyed by a 40% increase in new-home orders and a tax-related gain. "Evidence from the field suggests that the 'for sale' housing market has, in fact, bottomed and that we have commenced a slow and steady recovery process," said Chief Executive Stuart Miller in a statement Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales have been fueled by mortgage rates that have fallen to their lowest levels on record. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stood at 3.88% last week, the Mortgage Bankers Association said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>.'s fiscal second-quarter profit soared from a year earlier, boosted by a pickup in new-home sales and a tax-related gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong results from one of the nation's largest builders are the latest evidence that the hard-hit housing sector is healing. May's pending home sales, which are based on signed contracts, matched the highest level in two years, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This follows the closely watched S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price index, released Tuesday, that showed home prices in the largest metropolitan areas rose again in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Evidence from the field suggests that the 'for sale' housing market has, in fact, bottomed and that we have commenced a slow and steady recovery process," Lennar Chief Executive Stuart Miller said in the premarket release. "Although highly conservative mortgage-lending practices and challenging appraisals remain a constant headwind, we are experiencing net positive price and volume trends in most of our markets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results, which provide a glimpse into the end of the spring selling season, boosted <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>'s shares 4.8% to $28.70. <span class="companylink">KB Home</span>, which is expected to report quarterly results Friday, climbed 3% to $8.61, while <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>. added 2% to $9.88, all in 4 p.m. NYSE trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the quarter ended May 31, Miami-based <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> reported a profit of $452.7 million, or $2.06 a share, up from year-earlier earnings of $13.8 million, or seven cents a share. The most-recent quarter included $1.85 a share from a partial reversal of a deferred-tax asset valuation allowance. Excluding the gain, per-share earnings were 21 cents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue climbed 22% to $930.2 million as revenue from homebuilding also rose 22% to $808.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters recently expected a per-share profit of 17 cents on revenue of $886 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross margin on home sales widened to 22.5% from 19.4%, one of the sector's highest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deliveries rose 20% to 3,222 homes. New orders grew 40%, while the cancellation rate was 16%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry-watchers were largely positive on the builder's performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The company remains our top fundamental pick in the homebuilder space. <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>'s quarterly performance was impressive and provides further evidence that the U.S. housing market is, in fact, in recovery mode," wrote Vincent Foley, a builder analyst with <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>, in a client note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lennar</span> is in talks with China Development Bank for about $1.7 billion in capital to jump-start two San Francisco housing projects that have long been delayed, according to people familiar with the discussions.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Craig Karmin </div><div>1036 words</div><div>27 June 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a planned <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. real-estate fund got the cold shoulder from potential investors, it turned to a friendlier source: the bank itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Junius Real Estate Partners, named after the father of the largest U.S. bank's storied founder, recently has become active in commercial real estate after being staked with capital from the New York company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Junius is developing a Virginia resort and equestrian farm, acquired a suburban Chicago shopping mall and invested in an Ohio hotel portfolio. The properties have a combined value of about $465 million, according to people who were shown details of the deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Junius began raising money for a proposed $750 million fund, the bank planned to contribute 3% of the fund's total capital to comply with pending bank regulations, according to investors briefed by Junius. But that plan was put on hold when that effort stalled amid today's tough fundraising environment for real-estate deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> put up all of Junius's initial equity for those deals -- between $100 million and $110 million -- with the expectation that Junius will then raise that amount from individual and institutional investors to take over the bank's position, say people briefed on the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real-estate lawyers say it isn't clear whether this practice of providing equity would adhere to the new so-called Volcker rule, which prohibits banks from putting more than 3% of firm money into their own funds and will be phased in over the next two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A J.P. Morgan spokeswoman declined to comment on what the bank is doing to comply with the new rule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Junius isn't currently operating as a traditional real-estate closed-end fund, some lawyers think the Volcker rule won't apply. Still, even if the practice doesn't run afoul of the rule, some say it resembles the sort of speculative activity the rule was supposed to curb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's proprietary trading until they get out of it," said Michael Greenberger, a professor at the University of Maryland law school who has testified before Congress about markets and speculation. "The real-estate market is obviously quite risky."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the financial crisis, many financial firms provided capital to their real-estate funds. Doing so was often a way for a bank to ensure its new funds had money ready to invest before the fund had new commitments from outside investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there has been little of this activity since the real-estate downturn as banks got more leery about risk and proposed government regulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, several large financial firms have scaled back their commitment to real estate. <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>. sold its real-estate investment unit to <span class="companylink">Apollo Global Management LLC</span> in 2010, while <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>.'s Whitehall real-estate fund unit hasn't raised any money since the economic downturn. <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> plans to raise a new fund, but its target is much smaller than previous real-estate funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate bets by <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> are small compared with derivatives transactions that have caused more than $2 billion in losses at the bank. Junius doesn't expect to use more than $300 million of the bank's capital annually, according to people who have been in discussions with Junius.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Junius has found investors for nearly all the equity position in one real-estate transaction. The fund has raised some money for the second deal and has begun raising money for the third transaction, said a person familiar with the effort. After Junius raises outside capital, the bank hopes to reduce its holdings in the properties to 3% of the equity in each property. A J.P. Morgan spokeswoman declined to identify any investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, some investment banks were clobbered with losses because they got stuck with real-estate investments on their own balance sheets when the market turned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, for example, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> had about $700 million in write-offs and other losses from <span class="companylink">Crescent Real Estate Equities Co</span>., which held a portfolio of office buildings and other property. <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> had planned to put the portfolio into a fund owned by outside investors. But the market turned, and <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> wound up owning it as its value tumbled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>'s asset-management division has been a significant real-estate investor over the years, with about $61 billion of property-related assets under management as of March 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its flagship real-estate fund has $20 billion in assets, and more than $1 billion of investor capital is lining up to get in when it finds acquisition opportunities. That fund returned 15% for the 12 months through March and 4.9% for three-year period ended that month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through its funds, <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> owns many trophy properties across the U.S., including a Bellevue, Wash., office building leased primarily to <span class="companylink">Microsoft Corp</span>. and the former International Toy Center building on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But executives at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> wanted a bigger presence in the higher-risk, higher-return segment of real-estate investing because it tends to be more lucrative than traditional real-estate funds at the bank. These higher-risk funds typically take 20% of the profits after certain performance hurdles are crossed. Junius is targeting annual returns of 20% or higher, investors who spoke with Junius said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> recruited John Fraser, co-head of real estate at money manager Invescorp International Inc. to head Junius and hired other real-estate experts from <span class="companylink">Starwood Capital Group</span> and Goldman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Junius had a difficult time raising money because many investors said they wanted to see a track record before investing, potential investors said. Earlier this year, the group quietly put on hold efforts to raise money for the fund. Junius switched to trying to attract capital on a deal-by-deal basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group's three transactions are the Salamander Resort &amp; Spa in Middleburg, Va., a portfolio of 17 Marriott Hotels in Ohio and the Streets of Woodfield shopping center in Schaumburg, Ill.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Dinny McMahon and Robbie Whelan </div><div>1216 words</div><div>26 June 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., one of the U.S.'s largest home builders, is in talks with the China Development Bank for approximately $1.7 billion in capital to jump-start two long-delayed San Francisco projects that would transform two former naval bases into large-scale housing developments, according to people familiar with the discussions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The negotiations aren't final and the financing arrangement could still fall through. But if completed, the deal would reflect a changing dynamic between the U.S. and Chinese economies, as an American company turns to China for help funding a long-delayed and partially publicly funded project that otherwise wouldn't get done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developments, Treasure Island and Hunters Point Shipyard, also have the potential to alter San Francisco's housing market by providing nearly 20,000 new homes, a sports arena and millions of square feet of office and retail space in a market that is land-constrained and has had limited new construction. The city has committed hundreds of millions of dollars, in the form of tax-increment bonds, to the projects, which in total are expected to cost $10.5 billion over the next few decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, Chinese state money -- in large part provided by <span class="companylink">CDB</span> and its counterpart the <span class="companylink">Export-Import Bank of China</span> -- has been pivotal in funding major infrastructure and resource projects around the world, but the bulk of that activity has been in developing countries in Africa, South America and Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has resulted in the construction of dams, airports, railways, highways and sports arenas that otherwise wouldn't get built, primarily in developing countries. Funding is typically conditional upon Chinese developers and contractors being used to build the projects. And in order to keep costs down, and in many cases to ensure the necessary expertise, at least a portion of the workforce is flown in from China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This would be difficult or impossible in San Francisco, where local regulations and deals cut with local governments generally require developers to use local labor and pay prevailing wages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">CDB</span> and the <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> partnership have been in discussions to include <span class="companylink">China Railway Construction Corp</span>., a state-run contractor, in the development of Treasure Island and Hunters Point, according to people familiar with the matter. While it is unclear what CRCC's role would be, the company could serve as an adviser or in an consulting role, or could possibly even invest in a local construction company that employs U.S. workers, these people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People familiar with the negotiations said <span class="companylink">CDB</span> was using the Treasure Island and Hunters Point projects -- which both include "green" building and affordable housing components that are of interest to Chinese builders -- as a test case to become familiar with what's required for doing such deals in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami-based <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>, the third-largest U.S. home builder by the number of houses built, has a large presence in California, and is well known for its ability to put together complex financial deals, usually involving land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, at the height of the real-estate bubble, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> sold its stake in a complicated land venture known as LandSource to California's public pension system, for $660 million cash. The following year, LandSource filed for bankruptcy amid massive nationwide losses in real-estate values, and <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> bought back much of the land in the venture for pennies on the dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, Emile Haddad, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>'s former chief investment officer and the person behind the LandSource deal, launched a land-development company, with <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> as his majority investor, known as FivePoint Communities. FivePoint became the master developer for four big real-estate projects in California, including Hunters Point and Treasure Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have created a company that basically is in charge of [some] of the largest mixed-use land opportunities in the state of California," Mr. Haddad said in a 2011 interview. "We are creating the biggest urban development in San Francisco history."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Haddad declined to comment Monday. A Lennar spokesman also declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shipyard since 1870, Hunters Point was an important shipbuilding site during World War II, after it was taken over by the Navy. In the years following the war, the area around the shipyard continued to grow as a community of mainly low-income African-American families, some of whom worked on the docks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1999, long after the shipyard's closure, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> was selected to redevelop the site. The Hunters Point plan, which took over a decade to arrive at its final version, calls for 12,500 homes, a hotel, 3.5 million square feet of research-development and commercial space, and 800,000 square feet of retail space. <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>, which is joining with a subsidiary of Estein and Associates USA, Ross Perot Jr.'s Hillwood Develop nt Co. and Scala Real Estate Partners, is also planning to build an arena at nearby Candlestick Point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 2,500 people currently live on Treasure Island, a man-made island in the middle of San Francisco Bay that dates back to the late 1930s and is connected to San Francisco and Oakland by the Bay Bridge. In 1939 it was the site of the Golden Gate International Exposition, and later, the Navy operated a base there that was a major shipping-out point for sailors headed to the Pacific.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lennar</span> is joining with Wilson Meany, a San Francisco developer, along with Stockbridge Capital Group, Hillwood, Scala, Estein and Kenwood Investments to build the Treasure Island project, which includes up to 8,000 homes, a 500-room hotel and about 300,000 square feet of commercial space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On adjacent Yerba Buena Island, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> has plans for roughly 210 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think it's one of the greatest opportunities certainly in the city," said Michael Tymoff, project director for the Treasure Island Development Authority, the city body overseeing the project.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Negotiations between <span class="companylink">CDB</span> and the <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> partnership have been led by Kofi Bonner, a former deputy mayor of San Francisco who heads <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> Urban, a <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> division based in San Francisco. Mr. Bonner, along with the partnership's attorneys and Christopher Meany, a managing partner of Wilson Meany, have traveled to China over the past year to negotiate the deal, according to people familiar with the situation.

</div><div class="author">By Shira Ovide </div><div>936 words</div><div>26 June 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- The latest technology boom is helping to stem a decadelong exodus of residents from San Francisco, but the influx of well-paid workers is driving up already-high housing costs and straining public resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The promise and perils of the boom are evident in the experience of Genevieve Sheehan and her husband, who are relocating from the Boston area for her new job at social-games maker <span class="companylink">Zynga Inc</span>. They have endured a grinding hunt for a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Sheehan, a 29-year-old recent Harvard Business School graduate, said open houses were "a zoo." The couple was forced to boost their rental budget 40% to $3,500 a month before they landed a two-bedroom apartment. "A lot of people want to live here and are willing and able to pay incredibly high prices" to do so, Ms. Sheehan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Yorker Ian Schugel said finding a rental home in San Francisco is "so much more cutthroat" than in Manhattan, from which the 28-year-old and his partner are relocating. After one open house in South of Market, a neighborhood popular with tech firms and workers, they called 20 minutes later to find that the one-bedroom, listed at $3,100 a month, had been snapped up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new migration follows a long period in which San Francisco lost residents to states such as Arizona and Nevada, which offered jobs, cheaper housing and warmer weather. During the decade that ended in 2010, an average of 9,000 people a year left San Francisco for other parts of the U.S., according to <span class="companylink">California's Department of Finance</span>. The city of roughly 800,000 continued to grow due to immigration from abroad. But in the fiscal year ended last June 30, net domestic outflow fell to 3,400 people, the best performance since fiscal 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there are no migration data for late 2011 or this year, employers and economists say the renewal of San Francisco's tech scene is luring many workers from elsewhere. Local tech companies including <span class="companylink">Zynga</span> and <span class="companylink">Twitter Inc</span>. have expanded in San Francisco, and many techies who work at <span class="companylink">Facebook Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Google Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Apple Inc</span>., in Silicon Valley to the south, are opting to live in the city, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, the city's unemployment rate was 7.4%, down from 8.4% a year earlier. That compares with 8.1% for the nation, down from 9% a year earlier, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Livefyre Inc., a San Francisco start-up working on online-commenting technology, said it has hired about a quarter of its 45 employees from outside the Bay Area. "We're seeing more and more talent gravitating towards San Francisco, particularly in our engineering group, where we look across the country to recruit top talent," said Jordan Kretchmer, Livefyre's founder and chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's renewed popularity comes with problems. The average number of weekday riders on the Caltrain commuter line connecting San Francisco with Silicon Valley rose 12.7% in April from a year earlier, despite fare increases. "We're bursting at the seams," said Christine Dunn, a spokeswoman for Caltrain, which plans to add six trains to the service. In South of Market, the burgeoning pedestrian population is raising concerns about people getting hit by cars, said the city, which is weighing stronger traffic-control measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists and real-estate experts say San Francisco, with its tight supply of apartments and strict limits on the construction of new developments, can't keep up with the flood of techies streaming in. The result, beyond happy landlords, is soaring costs and a chaotic scrum for rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The San Francisco area, which real-estate research firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>. defines as the city plus Marin and San Mateo counties, had the nation's fastest-rising costs to rent a home in the first three months of this year. The average monthly rent hit $1,888, up 5.9% from a year earlier, the biggest jump of all U.S. metropolitan areas tracked by Reis. The rise nationwide was 2.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second-fastest-growing market was an area of Silicon Valley anchored by San Jose, where rents jumped 4.9% over the same period. The average rental cost remains about 20% lower in the San Jose area than in the San Francisco area -- the country's second-most-expensive rental market behind New York City, according to the Reis data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donovan McKendrick, owner of San Francisco property-management company DMcK Properties, said that earlier this year he raised the rent on a two-bedroom, 600-square-foot apartment in the Mission neighborhood by 40% to $2,800 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As long as we do basic renovations such as new paint and maybe cleaning up the appliances or installing new ones, we get 30% to 40% uplift in rent on the same unit," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gentrification is raising alarms among advocates for renters with low to moderate incomes. Some are being pushed out to cities up to 100 miles from San Francisco in search of affordable homes, advocates say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People have a lot of money and are willing to do whatever it takes to land a spot," said Ryan Paredez, a 26-year-old student at San Francisco State University who on a recent apartment hunt found himself contending with doctors and other professionals. "I can't compete with that."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes climbed to the highest level in two years, driven by limited supply of previously owned homes and record-low mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 369,000 in May, up 7.6% from April and nearly 20% from a year earlier, the Commerce Department said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace was the strongest since April 2010, when federal tax credits spurred sales. The median price climbed 5.6% in May from a year earlier to $234,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improvement comes as the housing sector appears to have hit bottom this spring after a six-year downturn. The road is expected to be bumpy, however, especially if the economy cools. In May, the nation added just 69,000 jobs -- the weakest monthly growth of the year -- and the jobless rate rose to 8.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such worries, along with concerns about Europe's fiscal health, weighed on home builders' stocks Monday, despite the strong new-home sales data. Shares in <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>., one of the nation's largest builders, closed down 1.7% on the New York Stock Exchange, while <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> stock closed down 0.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, most industry watchers were upbeat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We expect new-home sales to continue to trend higher in the coming months," said Dan Oppenheim, a builder analyst with <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>, in a client note. "This should help to alleviate recent investor concerns about a slowing in sales."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May's new-home sales in the Northeast rose 36.7%, while those in the South grew 12.7%. Midwest sales fell 10.6% and sales in the West declined 3.5%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Topping out at WTC</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It looks like developer Larry Silverstein will have bragging rights for building up to the roof of his new World Trade Center office tower before a rival building at the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Silverstein Properties Inc</span>. is planning a ceremony Monday to install the final steel beam of the exterior of 4 World Trade Center, its 977-foot tower designed by Fumihiko Maki. The event -- called a "topping out" -- is taking place four years and four months after Silverstein began work on what was then an 80-foot-deep pit. (Topping out is a celebrated point in skyscraper development when a steel beam for the final floor is installed.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile One World Trade Center, which is being developed by the <span class="companylink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</span>, is taking longer. The <span class="companylink">Port Authority</span> first began putting up steel in December 2006, more than one year before 4 World Trade Center got underway. Its topping out ceremony is expected soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's long been a rivalry between Silverstein and the <span class="companylink">Port Authority</span>, which has occasionally gotten ugly as they've battled over the redevelopment of the complex that was destroyed by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Silverstein's side has trumpeted the fact that he completed the rebuilding of 7 World Trade Center in 2006 as evidence that the private sector is more efficient than the government-controlled <span class="companylink">Port Authority</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For at least the past year, the two buildings -- which share a construction manager, TIshman Construction Corp. -- had been expecting to top out around the same time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One World Trade is taking longer to build partly because it's taller, reaching 1,368 feet to its roof and 1,776 feet to the top of its antenna. Also, a spokesman for the Port Authority points out that its project is more complex than Silverstein's boxy counterpart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One World Trade had twice the amount of construction underground, it reaches nearly 400 feet higher, and it has a giant steel and concrete bunker that forms the bottom floors, the construction of which wasn't quick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Port Authority</span> officials had been considering holding a topping out ceremony for One World Trade on Tuesday, but it now will likely be moved to a later date, according to people briefed on the scheduling process.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tech on a Tear</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For months it's been clear to office-building landlords that the technology sector is emerging as one of the few engines of growth in the city's economy. Now a new report by <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>. is about to be released showing just how powerful that engine is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the report, the tech sector fueled 159 real-estate deals in 2011, compared with just 74 in 2008. Companies that have embarked on well-known expansions in New York City include <span class="companylink">Google</span>, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, <span class="companylink">eBay</span>, Apple and Twitter. <span class="companylink">Apple Inc</span>. has nearly quintupled its foothold since 2008 to 55,000 square feet today, and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> has tripled in size to 40,000 square feet, according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, nearly 1,000 tech start-ups have been created in New York City in recent years, while in 2011 venture capitalists invested $2.7 billion in 379 deals in the New York Metro area, according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately for landlords, the tech boom doesn't make up for the contraction in the financial services sector. And some landlords still remember the last technology boom in the late 1990s, which burst suddenly, leaving them with huge vacancies virtually overnight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the CBRE report says the fact that the industry has shown sustained growth since 2008, even through a downturn in the economy, shows this tech boom is more stable. "If you look back to 2000, it was quick run up and it fell awfully quick," says Sacha Zarba, a broker at <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google Inc</span>., which has grown from 650,000 square feet in 2008 to 930,000 square feet today, purchased a building at 111 Eighth Ave. in an effort to accommodate its growth needs. But now the tech giant is searching for more than 100,000 square feet, according to people familiar with the matter. CBRE represented <span class="companylink">Google</span> when it purchased 111 Eighth and is representing it in its search today.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sweet Tooth for Space</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dylan's Candy Bar, the popular Upper East Side sweet spot, is about to get a neighbor that may provide some relief to those who have loaded up on too many jelly beans, chocolate bars and Gummy Bears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">GNC Holdings Inc</span>., the expanding retailer of vitamins and other health products, has leased a store for a new Manhattan outlet one block away from Dylan's at the <span class="companylink">Trump Organization</span>'s 1034 Third Ave. That deal, along with another lease that GNC just signed in Chelsea, at 275 Seventh Ave., represent the retailer's 41st and 42nd locations in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Dylan's is mostly for kids," says Ariel Schuster, a retail broker with Robert K. Futterman &amp; Associates, who represented GNC in the deal. "I'm sure some adults will go drop off their kids at parties, and walk over, since they are concerned about their health."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terms of the GNC deals weren't available. Retail experts say that rents on that part of Third Avenue range between $200 to $300 a square foot. In Chelsea the range is $125 to $250 per square foot, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founded in 1935, Pittsburgh-based GNC operates in 7,700 locations worldwide including company-owned stores and franchises. According to Mike Nuzzo, the company's chief financial officer, GNC plans to increase the number of company owned stores and franchises in the U.S. by 145 during the remainder of 2012.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eric Morath and Josh Mitchell   </div><div>824 words</div><div>22 June 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. fell in May, suggesting that economic headwinds and a lack of available lower-priced properties may be holding back the housing market's recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits fell slightly last week from an upwardly revised level, though the overall level continues to indicate a weakened labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales decreased 1.5% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.55 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors' chief economist Lawrence Yun said sales of lower prices homes, those costing $100,000 or less, are leading the decline, even while sales of houses priced at $250,000 or more are on the rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That I attribute to lack of inventory of lower-end homes," he said, as opposed to a lack of demand tied to a slowing economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But compared to a year earlier, May sales were 9.6% higher, and it was the 11th consecutive month of sales gains compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected a 4.57 million rate of sales in May. That would have been a 1.1% fall from the 4.62 million rate in April. The prior month's numbers were unrevised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price in May was $182,600, up 7.9% from a year earlier. That was the highest median price since June 2010, when the home buyer tax credit was nearing expiration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price increase was partially due to fewer sales of foreclosed homes and more sales of more expensive properties. Foreclosures and other distressed properties made up 25% of May sales, the lowest level since the Realtors' group began tracking the number in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of previously owned homes listed for sale, meanwhile, decreased 0.4% during May to 2.49 million. That represented a 6.6-month supply at the current sales pace, a pace considered healthy by economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, the housing market has improved slowly after a collapse in prices that started in summer 2006. Maintaining that momentum could be difficult if the economy continues to cool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May the country added just 69,000 jobs -- the worst growth of the year -- and the unemployment rate moved up to 8.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help prop up the economy, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> on Wednesday extended through the end of the year a program known as "Operation Twist," which aims to drive down long-term interest rates and reduce borrowing costs for businesses and households. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said the stimulus was necessary as the U.S. economy faces a number of headwinds, including a housing market that has improved slower than expected since the recovery began in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' report said home sales fell in three of four U.S. regions. Sales in the Northeast fell 4.8%, sales in the West fell 3.4% and by 0.6% in the South. Sales in the Midwest grew 1.0%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial jobless claims fell by 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 387,000 in the week ended June 16, the Labor Department said Thursday. The prior week's figure was revised higher from a previous estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast 385,000 new jobless claims would be filed last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week moving average of new claims, considered a more-reliable figure because it smooths out weekly gyrations, rose by 3,500 to 386,250. Initial jobless claims -- a measure of the pace of employer layoffs -- have fallen for two of the past three weeks. However, claims are still running higher from late April and early May, and are close to the 400,000 threshold that economists say indicates the labor market is stalling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new figure comes a day after the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> offered a gloomier outlook for economic growth and unemployment this year. Fed officials said after their latest policy meeting that they now expect unemployment to be between 8% and 8.2% at the end of 2012. That is up from their projection in April of 7.8% to 8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unemployment rate last month was 8.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an attempt to spur growth, Fed officials announced they would extend a program known as Operation Twist intended to drive down long-term borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's report showed that the number of all unemployed workers receiving insurance remained unchanged at 3.299 million in the week ended June 9. That figure is reported with a one-week lag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, the number of people filing claims was equivalent to 2.6% of workers paying into the system, the same as the prior week.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kelsey Gee   </div><div>572 words</div><div>22 June 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes in May posted sharp gains compared with a year ago, but were down from April, underscoring the fragility of the housing market's recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported Thursday that sales of existing, or previously owned, homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.55 million units in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While that was down 1.5% from 4.62 million in April, it represented an increase of 9.6% compared with a year earlier and represented the 11th consecutive month of year-over-year increases in sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data reflect completed sales transaction of single-family homes, townhouses and condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly drop reflected tight inventory rather than softening demand, said Lawrence Yun, the Realtors' chief economist. "The normal seasonal upturn in inventory did not occur this spring," he said. The result, said Mr. Yun, is a shortage of properties for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is partly because some potential sellers are keeping their homes off the market in hopes of higher prices in the future. At the end of May, there was a 6.6-month supply of homes for sale, slightly higher than April but 20% below levels of a year ago, according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks have contributed to the tight inventory by limiting the number of foreclosed properties they put up for sale. Distressed properties -- which includes foreclosures -- accounted for a quarter of all sales in May, down from 31% in the same month a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's been a pent-up demand," said Joan Downing, a Realtor in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. "Sellers held off selling because they thought they'd have to price their properties really low, and buyers held off because they thought the prices would keep coming down and down and down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, prices are edging higher. The national median price of an existing home in May was $182,600, up 7.9% from a year ago and the third consecutive month of year-to-year price gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Winnetka, Ill., dermatologist James Lahti just sold his $1.04 million home to move into a larger six-bedroom nearby. He wanted a bigger backyard and more space for his family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were living in a house that we knew we would be outgrowing," said the 44-year old father of four. The house he bought for $1.87 million had been on the market for more than 400 days. Meanwhile, Mr. Lahti's old house received multiple offers and went into contract within five days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family was motivated to buy and sell quickly because they wanted to take advantage of low interest rates. "We figured if we waited, it could only make the situation much worse" if rates went up again quickly, he said. A <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> survey this week showed 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to 3.66%, a record low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the recent improvements in the housing market, concern that conditions could change has made some people anxious. Dennis Bledsoe, 73, of Walnut Creek, Calif., sold his home six weeks ago for $450,000 and moved into a retirement community. "I did not want to take the chance of prices dropping quickly," he said. "If that happened I would be stuck, so I figured it would be time to make some kind of move."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TORONTO—The Canadian dollar slumped Thursday against a broadly strengthening U.S. dollar as weak North American economic indicators and a tightening of domestic mortgage rules led investors to seek the safety of the greenback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. dollar was recently at C$1.0287, from C$1.0187 at 8:00 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT) Thursday morning, and C$1.0183 late Wednesday, according to data provider CQG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government dramatically tightened Canada's mortgage financing rules to more prudent standards on Thursday. The changes include cuts to the maximum amortization period for government-backed insured mortgages to 25 years from 30 years, while the maximum amount that an individual can borrow when refinancing will be lowered to 80% from 85%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian retail sales registered a disappointing 0.5% decline from the month before, lower than expectations of a 0.2% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile in the U.S., the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia</span> said business conditions within the factory sector weakened in June, dropping to -16.6 from -5.8 in May, another sign that the U.S.'s economy is slowing down,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, sales of previously owned houses fell slightly last month, while home prices rose and the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell in the last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The stars were aligned against Canada," said Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets. "Every piece of data from international to domestic worked against the Canadian dollar."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Sutton described Canada's new mortgage rules as a "long-term positive" that should do help to ease the pressure of a housing bubble from emerging in the country's red hot real estate sector, but it still presented a short-term risk on housing demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going forward, Ms. Sutton expects the Canadian dollar to moderately strengthen as investors begun to move back into equities and other risk assets now that fears in the euro-zone have subsided.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The intercorrelation between markets has started to break down which is a sign that markets are moving on fundamentals and not on European pressures," Ms. Sutton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The poor U.S. data helped the safe-haven U.S. dollar throughout Thursday's trading session, and it moved higher against the euro, Japanese yen, British pound and commodities currencies such as the Norwegian krone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, Canada's consumer price index data for May will be released that should provide some direction for the Canadian dollar, although investors will also be keeping watch on external headlines.</p>

</div><div class="author">By S. Mitra Kalita and Nick Timiraos   </div><div>1406 words</div><div>21 June 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As more U.S. housing markets improve, an adage about what matters in real estate is proving true: location, location, location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While property markets across the country rose together during the housing boom and fell together during the crash, new data analyzed by real-estate firm <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>. for The Wall Street Journal show that markets are exiting the downturn at different speeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings come amid fresh evidence Tuesday of the housing recovery's tentative progress. May single-family housing starts rose by 3.2% from April on a seasonally adjusted annual basis, while building permits increased 7.9%, according to the Commerce Department. Sales of existing homes in May -- a benchmark of the health of the critical spring sales season -- are due Thursday, and early reports suggest many markets are notching increases from the weak levels of one year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That fitful recovery is reflected in the Zillow analysis. Homes in sought-after neighborhoods, including those near transportation corridors and with top-notch public schools, are finding buyers. But others in neighborhoods just a few miles away, including so-called exurbs or areas that never fully gentrified, are languishing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow tracked price changes by ZIP Codes for dozens of metropolitan areas in April compared with three months earlier. The company uses a proprietary model, considering factors such as sales and appraisals, to determine the value of all homes in a given area. The data paint a picture of an uneven housing recovery that is lifting some neighborhoods while bypassing others just a few blocks or miles away. "You can actually see the seeds of the recovery starting to spread at the ZIP Code level," said Stan Humphries, Zillow's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm's data reflect a broad recovery in a handful of markets. Nearly 94% of Phoenix ZIP Codes and 90% of Denver ZIP Codes saw values rise during the three-month period ending in April, up from 5% and 6% a year ago, respectively. A few are getting worse. Just 6% of ZIP Codes in Albany, N.Y., posted gains in April, down from 28% one year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many fall somewhere in between. In Seattle, home values rose in more than a third of ZIP Codes. While that is a sharp improvement from a year ago, when just 3% of ZIP Codes saw values rise, continued declines in the rest of the region have left overall values below their year-earlier levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Washington, D.C., where values overall were up by 0.3% from one year ago, about 40% of ZIP Codes nonetheless saw values decline over the three-month period ending in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More housing markets across the country are reporting a boost in sales compared with last spring, even as the number of homes for sale has dropped in many markets. In Seattle, for example, listings at the end of May were down 43% from a year ago, largely because of banks slowing down foreclosures and sellers keeping their properties off the market rather than accepting big losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is that prices are beginning to rise, but "it's not happening in every neighborhood," said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Seattle-based brokerage Redfin, which operates in 18 metro areas. "There's a real flight to quality."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When neighborhoods with high-quality schools, low crime rates and attractive houses "become more affordable, that's where you see intense demand," Mr. Kelman said. Buyers want "a Tiffany diamond at a discount," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home values in those communities -- towns such as Newton, Mass., Bethesda, Md., or Palo Alto, Calif. -- have always held up better than marginal communities, and they once again stand to benefit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Seattle, the Ballard neighborhood ranks high on that list. Within five days of listing their home there, Kali Sakai and her husband received 10 offers for the 1930s brick Tudor on a quiet street. "Things in Seattle aren't going great, and so we thought, 'Maybe we're going to have a hard time,'" said Ms. Sakai, who is 38 years old. "But we're in a nice neighborhood that attracts young families."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They sold the three-bedroom house, which they had rented out for the past year, for nearly $465,000, more than 10% above their asking price. The home is down the street from a park in a historic maritime village settled by Scandinavians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes also are moving quickly in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. "We were a little bit caught off guard," said Elliot Cundiff. He and his wife sold their home there in just two days in April for their full $659,000 asking price. While Mr. Cundiff said he misses being able to walk to his downtown office one mile south, he and his wife wanted more space for their growing family. They moved to a quieter, more expensive part of town one mile north.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Capitol Hill, values were up 1.2% from one year ago, according to Zillow. In April, values in Ballard were at 2005 levels, up by 0.5% over the past year and 1.5% over the past quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, prices are still declining in some of Seattle's far-flung exurbs and emerging urban communities, which benefited from a housing boom that priced first-time home buyers out of more established neighborhoods. In Auburn, a middle-class suburb featuring 1950s-style ranch homes 30 minutes south of downtown Seattle, values are down 10.5% over the past year. Chris Jalbert's four-bedroom home in Auburn is listed for $315,000, the same amount he paid more than a decade ago. He is trying to sell it himself to avoid a broker's commission but has had little luck. "I have gotten more people wanting to rent it than buy it," said Mr. Jalbert, a salesman who plans to get married and move in with his wife this summer. Would-be buyers "want to low-ball me on price," he said. "They think I'm underwater and can get a good deal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Frink, an agent with Prudential Northwest Realty, last month found a buyer for a four-bedroom home in a newer Auburn development who agreed to pay $274,000, down from the original price of $325,000 when the home was listed in February. "I don't think anybody's selling who doesn't absolutely have to," Mr. Frink said. He sold the house for a relocation company that had bought it from its owner, who was transferred to Nebraska by his company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the housing boom, some Americans took on longer commute times to afford the dream of homeownership. The fastest-growing communities in the U.S. were areas such as Loudon County, a Virginia suburb 25 miles from Washington, D.C.; Kendall County, Ill., 40 miles from Chicago and Rockwall County, Texas, 30 miles from Dallas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The marginal neighborhoods won't do well until the so-called desirable neighborhoods are completely fished out," Mr. Kelman said. Many of those communities also face the brunt of potential foreclosures -- the "shadow inventory" of homes -- that haven't yet been taken back and resold by banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is borne out in the nation's capital, where communities that aren't close to the city or near the Metro rapid-rail system aren't as desirable to buyers. "If it's a great location, it's getting multiple offers and sometimes bid up," said Dina Paxenos with Washington brokerage Evers &amp; Co.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other areas are often out of luck. Ms. Paxenos cited a listing she has had for almost three months: a 1,000-square-foot one-bedroom condo in southern Arlington County, Va. Known as Shirlington, the community was developed as an "urban village" outside Washington -- a boom-era concept mixing condos and retail. There is a shuttle to the Metro, but most buyers prefer to be within walking distance, Ms. Paxenos said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Zillow data, the ZIP Code that includes Shirlington has seen home prices fall by 1%. But in an Arlington neighborhood three miles away, which is walking distance to the Metro and flanked by the Pentagon City and Crystal City shopping centers, values have risen 9.4% over the past year, putting it just below the neighborhood's peak prices in 2006.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home building slowed in May amid a pullback in multifamily construction, but new permits granted reached their highest level since 2008, suggesting future demand for houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction decreased 4.8% last month from April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 708,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Compared with a year ago, housing starts were up 28.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expected May housing starts would grow to aseasonally adjusted annual rate of 720,000. April starts were revised up to a rate of 744,000 -- the highest level since October 2008. The new figures reflect a 5.4% improvement from March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of single-family homes, which made up 72.9% of housing starts last month, grew 3.2% in May to a rate of 516,000 units, the highest level since December. Single-family building was up 26.2% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, multifamily homes with at least two units, a volatile portion of the market, fell 21.3% in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign of future construction, new housing permits grew 7.9% to an annualized level of 780,000 in May. That was above economists forecast for 730,000 new permits and the highest monthly level since September 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically low interest rates and relatively cheap prices are attracting some buyers back to the market for new homes that essentially collapsed during the financial crisis. The renewed interest is a cause for optimism among builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year's home-construction figures, while up from a low of 478,000 in April 2009, are still well below the historical average. Builders have started construction on about 1.5 million new homes a year since 1959.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have struggled to attract buyers in recent years as an ample inventory of previously-owned homes, which tend to be cheaper, ate away at what little demand existed.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown and Craig Karmin </div><div>952 words</div><div>20 June 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a real-estate development drought that stretches back to 2008, a handful of high-risk real-estate projects are moving forward in major U.S. cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But instead of relying on debt markets as they did during the boom, developers are financing these projects with equity, mostly from outside investors. That lowers the risk of turning over a building to lenders if the project fails, but it also raises the stakes for developers and investors, who are putting more of their own money on the line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the murky economic outlook, developers are moving ahead with major office buildings without any committed tenants in cities like Chicago and San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, CIM Group is finishing the foundation of its planned 1,400-foot condominium on Park Avenue, set to be the tallest residential tower in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The projects demonstrate how the real-estate development business has changed. The big banks that traditionally make construction loans have been reluctant to restart lending, particularly to projects that haven't yet leased space or, in the case of condos, sold units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some investors who aren't as risk-averse are willing to move forward on these projects with their own capital because values have been rising for high-quality office buildings and other commercial real estate in major cities. Prices for high-end residential properties in select areas like Manhattan also are picking up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the years leading up to the recession, developers and investors typically would borrow up to 90% of the financing for a project. Putting up only a small sliver of their own capital, they stood to make oversize gains. But when the downturn hit, many investors couldn't pay back their debts and were forced to turn over their properties to lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financing projects with mostly equity greatly lowers this risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while the potential gains are reduced in this strategy, the returns still look good to investors in an environment of low interest rates and turbulent stock markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Ultimately, we're going to live in a world that's slower growth and lower returns for quite a while," Michael Fascitelli, chief executive of office and retail landlord <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span>, said at a real-estate panel this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Active investors in developments include the asset-management division of <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>., which is putting in the lion's share of the equity into three office developments totaling more than one million square feet. One is in New York with Texas-based developer Hines, and two are in San Francisco with Tishman Speyer Properties. All are "speculative," meaning that they are moving forward without any signed leases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hines also is moving ahead with a speculative, 45-story office building in Chicago. Montreal-based <span class="companylink">Ivanhoe Cambridge</span>, the real-estate arm of a Canadian pension-fund money manager, has committed $300 million in equity to that development along the Chicago River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in New York, private-equity firm CIM took the unusual step of raising equity for its condo tower by tapping individual investors who put in at least $1 million each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Angeles-based CIM, which was advised by <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>., had planned to raise $100 million to $215 million this way, according to people with direct knowledge of the financing. But demand from these relatively small investors was greater than expected, and CIM brought in more than $300 million, these people said. CIM is close to finalizing the rest of the $1.2 billion project's financing, most of it equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moves come as real-estate development in most parts of the country remains in the doldrums, particularly in such sectors as office, condominiums and retail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 33.5 million square feet of office space was under development in May, up from the 24.4 million at the end of 2011, but still well below the 107.7 million at the end of 2007, according to real-estate services firm <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developments now moving forward are primarily in markets that have seen high demand for certain types of space. For example, demand for high-end condos in New York remains strong, while a booming technology sector is pushing office vacancies down and rents up in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But real-estate experts say the appeal of development primarily is a reflection of rising values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index of institutional-quality U.S. real-estate value compiled by Green Street Advisors has increased 53% since its May 2009 trough and is now just 6% below its 2007 high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While part of that increase has been driven by rising rents and occupancies, analysts say much of it comes from increasing investor demand for properties. As a result, many buildings' values have risen even though their incomes have stayed relatively flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has made development attractive. In San Francisco, for example, investors have paid as much as $800 a square foot for office buildings, while developing a new property would cost about 25% less than that, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should the economy deteriorate, development projects under way would be highly vulnerable, especially those that haven't leased up space or sold units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But so far, developers who were the first to break ground in the current cycle seem to be doing well. For example, a partnership led by Hines that began a 520,000 square foot Washington office building without a tenant last year, signed a letter of intent last month with law firm <span class="companylink">Covington &amp; Burling LLP</span>. If completed, the deal would bring the building to more than 80% leased.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan   </div><div>1025 words</div><div>19 June 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent rise in home building could be thwarted by an unlikely factor -- a shortage of land in desirable locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the housing boom, developers -- the companies that pave roads and sidewalks, dig ditches for sewage pipes and power lines and bring in bulldozers to clear space for construction -- prepared hundreds of thousands of lots and sold them to home builders, which in turn built subdivisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today many of these lots remain empty. These lots often are in distant suburbs of cities and still owned by banks, builders or developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that they are in places where few home buyers want to live. In fact, builders are running low on land in suburbs that have well-regarded school districts and reasonable commutes to city and job centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is weighing on the recovery of the new-home market that in recent months has showed signs of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists are optimistic that housing starts -- the number of houses and apartments on which construction has begun each year -- will rise 15% to 25% in 2012, a prediction that could be bolstered by the May housing starts report due out this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts have been ticking up, sales of newly built homes are higher and, in some areas, new-home prices are rising. But in markets such as Atlanta, for example -- where home prices fell 18% in the latest Case-Shiller report -- there is land as far as the eye can see, but few good places to build.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlanta metropolitan area has about 120,000 vacant lots ready for building, some as far as 70 miles from the city's downtown, according to real-estate consultancy Metrostudy Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of the demand during the boom was speculative demand, not real user demand, and speculative demand was blind to location," said Brad Hunter, Metrostudy's chief economist. "Real demand is now concentrated in those core counties."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bidding wars are breaking out for lots in prime locations, with some builders developing raw land themselves in Atlanta's nearer suburbs such as Roswell, Dunwoody and Johns Creek.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One such battle unfolded at the Paddocks, a 240-acre subdivision near Cumming, a suburb near an interstate with a public school district that has a good reputation. In the past six months, four publicly traded builders bid up the price on a patch of raw land planned for about 130 houses to nearly $90,000 an acre from $40,000 an acre, according Scott McGregor, a land broker with Resource Real Estate Partners, which is handling the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Eighteen months ago no one would talk about buying undeveloped land," Mr. McGregor said. "Today, everyone is clamoring all over each other to get these good land positions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere in metropolitan Atlanta, there are plenty of cleared lots that are likely to remain vacant for another decade or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Of all the lots out there, probably 95% of them are unbuildable," said Patrick Malloy, an Atlanta-area builder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Malloy said home prices are recovering -- but only in the city and nearby suburbs, starting in the established affluent neighborhood of Buckhead and going north.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much farther outside Atlanta, "the sales prices for homes are less than what the sticks and bricks cost," Mr. Malloy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means the recovery in both home construction and new-home sales could be held back until developers replenish their supply of land, especially in areas where buyers want to live. According to data analyzed by Capital Economics, the 12 biggest publicly traded home builders controlled 632,864 land lots at the end of the first quarter of 2012, compared with 1.8 million six years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less land on hand translates into less building and fewer construction jobs. According to Capital Economics, there is a close historical correlation between housing starts and land owned by builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the short run, desirable land gets constrained when you're in an up cycle," says Michael Feroli, an economist with <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>. "The new-home market is not going to turn on a dime . . . If there were a surge in demand, the supply response would take several months, or even a few quarters."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists predict that builders will start work on between 700,000 and 750,000 units of housing in 2012. That is up from 608,000 starts last year but well below the annual average of 1.7 million built between 1998 and 2004. That is also far less than the two million at the peak of the market in 2005. Of course, fewer new homes being built means a tighter supply of existing homes, which could help push up prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two recent surveys from housing-research firms John Burns Real Estate Consultants and Zelman &amp; Associates suggest that until these land inventories rise, new-home sales and construction will be constrained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As builders run out of "finished lots" -- land that has been developed and is ready to be built on -- in good locations, land prices in these areas are rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Any kind of pop in sales volume this spring is going to deplete the builders' land positions in their current communities, the really desirable locations . . . and I can really see how difficult it's going to be to replenish these locations," said Jody Kahn, who specializes in land issues for the Burns group. "We're coming off of the bottom, and it's a little bit like trying to run in a swimming pool. You can run all you want, but it's hard to get any kind of speed or momentum."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The builders' response to the shortage likely will be to pay more for the most desirable, and most scarce land, or to begin developing raw land themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both courses require large up-front capital commitments and both will likely require builders to pass on the additional costs to consumers in the form of new-home prices. That could make it harder for builders to compete on price with existing homes, whose values have been suppressed by foreclosures and short sales.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glimmers of hope in the housing market suggest a turnaround is at hand, with statistics showing stabilizing home prices and an increasing number of home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet even as housing conditions improve, mortgage interest rates remain near record-low levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.71% for the week ended June 14, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s weekly survey of conforming rates. Prior to that week, rates had broken record lows for six weeks straight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a situation that seems to defy supply-and-demand logic: If there's more demand in the housing market, wouldn't the cost of borrowing funds to buy a home be on the rise?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not necessarily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates are influenced by a number of factors, including policy decisions from the U.S. Federal Reserve and the overall economic picture both in the U.S. and abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Fed</span> has kept long-term interest rates low, in part through its Operation Twist program, scheduled to end this month, says Frank Nothaft, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Operation Twist involves the Fed buying long-term securities and selling short-term debt. There has been chatter among members of the Federal Open Market Committee about the possibility of extending the program or taking other steps to keep long-term interest rates low, Mr. Nothaft says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The uncertainty in Europe—including continuing worry about whether the euro zone will remain integrated and new concerns about Spain's economy—also is affecting rates. Out of fear, more investors are moving their money to safe havens, pushing yields on investments such as 10-year Treasury bonds downward. The secondary mortgage market uses yields on the 10-year Treasury as a barometer of how to set 30-year fixed-rate interest rates, says Matt Vernon, a mortgage executive at Bank of America Home Loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, there's "rampant uncertainty" about how the story in Europe will play out, so investors are playing it safe, says Michael Fratantoni, the Mortgage Bankers Association's vice president of research and economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The descent of fixed-rate mortgage rates has gone beyond most people's expectations, however. "Rates have come down far, far more than I would have thought at the beginning of this year," Mr. Nothaft says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While improvements in the economy can influence mortgage rates, there simply hasn't been enough good news domestically to drive mortgage rates higher. "Some of the major housing metrics are better than a year ago," Mr. Nothaft says, including housing starts—the number of new homes on which builders broke ground—and home sales. But they're still anemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices seem to have stopped their downward spiral, but homes aren't appreciating at rates that are normal by historical standards, adds Alex Villacorta, director of research and analytics at Clear Capital, a provider of data for real-estate asset valuation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clear Capital recently reported that national home prices were up only 0.1% in the second quarter, from the year-earlier period. That's far from the 3% to 4% appreciation expected in a healthy market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"National home prices are up, and that's the first time that's happened in some time," Mr. Villacorta says. "This is a necessary first step to this recovery," he adds. But housing isn't out of the woods yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent report from Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies suggests the housing recovery is still in its early stages and faces obstacles, including foreclosures yet to hit the market and the drop in median household incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given all the factors, the Mortgage Bankers Association expects the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage to end the year at an average 4.2%. That's higher than current rates, but still relatively low. <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s most recent projection also pegs the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 4.2% by year-end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For borrowers, that means low mortgage rates aren't expected to go away anytime soon. And that's a good thing since many would-be buyers continue to have jitters about making a purchase, says Ron Chicaferro, a mortgage-industry consultant in Scottsdale, Ariz. Often, worries about job stability are preventing people who otherwise could buy a home from making a purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The desire is there," he says, "but the fear prevents the move."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those interested in refinancing, however, should be aware that rates are near their lowest points on record, and are expected to eventually start creeping up. So if it makes sense to do a refinance at the current rates, and you can qualify for the loan, it's a good idea to take action sooner rather than later.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael Howard Saul </div><div>839 words</div><div>15 June 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After funding cutbacks ended a New York City rental-assistance program earlier this year, hundreds of recipients -- most of them children -- have returned to the homeless shelter system, according to city statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program, called Advantage, came to a halt in February. At the time, upward of 18,700 people made up the 6,482 households that were receiving rent subsidies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, nearly 500 people, 300 of them children, have found their way back into shelters, officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both city officials and homeless advocates expect the number to grow significantly. The city estimates nearly 1,000 families could return to city homeless shelters by year's end, while a new study to be released Friday from the <span class="companylink">Coalition for the Homeless</span> estimates 3,000 Advantage families will return this year, with 2,000 of those returning as a direct result of the payments ending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase comes as the shelter system is already grappling with record numbers of homeless. As of April, there were 43,000 people, including 17,000 children, sleeping each night in city shelters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been a stubborn problem for Mayor Michael Bloomberg: The ranks of people sleeping in shelters has risen nearly 40% since he took office in 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advantage was intended as a bridge between homelessness and self-sufficiency, offering two years of rent subsidies to help participants get back on their feet. Recipients had to work at least 20 hours a week and cover 30% to 40% of their rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bloomberg administration canceled Advantage in the spring of 2011 when the city lost the state and federal funding it needed to keep the program afloat. Advocates sued to force the city to make the payments on its own, but in February an appeals court permitted the city to stop sending the checks. The case is still pending on appeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We did the things we were supposed to do, and I feel like the proverbial rug has been ripped out from under us, and now we're back in shelter," said Patrece Murray, 33, a former Advantage recipient who has three children with medical issues. "I'm angry with the city."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Murray's children haven't been to school since they moved into a shelter on June 5. "It's been a traumatic experience," she said. "It's one hell of a mess."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seth Diamond, commissioner of the city's Department of Homeless Services, described the number of Advantage families that have returned to the shelter system so far as "relatively modest." He said the city is "very aggressively" working to prevent evictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Diamond criticized advocates for the homeless, blaming them for the program's demise. Mr. Diamond said advocates lobbied against the program in Albany as the city was asking lawmakers to maintain the funding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The responsibility for why the program ended sooner than we would have liked does not lie with the city of New York," Mr. Diamond said. "The advocates have failed the ones who . . . lost the subsidy, and I think that was very unfortunate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Markee, a senior policy analyst for the coalition, acknowledged that he and other advocates believe the program was flawed, but "the idea that we wanted the Advantage program to end and be replaced by nothing at all is absurd."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The city had made a promise to these families that it would pay two years of rental assistance to them," Mr. Markee said. "To break that promise and pull the rug out from under them was unconscionable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an attempt to address part of the problem, the city has begun a targeted eviction-prevention program in Bronx Housing Court, screening Advantage members to determine whether they're eligible for a different subsidy and a pro bono attorney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since April, 600 families have been screened. Within 10 weeks, the city said, 30 of those cases have been favorably resolved. This summer, the pilot program will be expanded to Brooklyn and Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocates said they believe 30 successful cases out of 600 demonstrates a problem, but city officials said they believe many of the other cases will be resolved favorably.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Banks, attorney in chief at the Legal Aid Society, which sued the city over the cancellation of the program, called the end of the subsidy a "ticking time-bomb" that will cost taxpayers more than the subsidies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, tenants such as Katrice Bryson, a 31-year-old single mother with a part-time job, face eviction. Ms. Bryson said she will be tossed out of her apartment if she doesn't find $2,100 by the end of the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's scary. I don't have that kind of money," Ms. Bryson said "I'm trying to do everything in my power not to go back to the shelter. I'm hoping and praying to God, but the way things are looking, I don't know. I'm in limbo right now."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The six-year slide in U.S. home prices and the dollar's weakness against some currencies are driving a property-buying binge by Asians, Canadians, Europeans and Latin Americans eager to own a piece of America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plowing money into real estate may sound like a risky venture to many Americans. But to growing numbers of foreigners, U.S. housing has never seemed a smarter investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">International buyers accounted for $82.5 billion, or 8.9%, of the $928 billion spent on residential real estate in the 12-month period that ended in March, according a survey released Monday by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. That was up 24% from $66.4 billion in the previous-year period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey showed that about 55% of all international buyers came from five countries: Canada, China, Mexico, India and the United Kingdom. Five states, meanwhile, accounted for around 55% of all sales to international buyers: Florida, California, Texas, Arizona, and New York. The survey found that 62% of international buyers paid in cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Money is always looking for a place to go," said Elida Jacobsen Justo, who oversees sales at the Mark, a hotel on New York City's Upper East Side that is selling nine luxury residences. Last week, she fielded a call from a broker whose client is from Spain and is looking to buy a three-to-four bedroom apartment for $10 million to $20 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the euro crisis has weakened the currency-exchange advantage that prevailed in recent years for European buyers, real-estate agents say demand is still strong thanks to America's perceived safe-haven status amid the slow-boiling debt woes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan, foreign buyers, led by Russians and Ukrainians, are setting records by buying apartments at some of the city's high-end addresses. In Miami, Brazilians and Venezuelans have helped soak up a glut of condos in glass towers overlooking Biscayne Bay, while in Arizona, Canadians are snapping up foreclosed properties they hope to rent out at a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's this international view that America is on sale," said Eric Workman, vice president of sales and marketing for Mack Companies, a Chicago-based company that buys foreclosed homes and manages them as rentals for other investors. Mr. Workman said that around 20% of the 102 properties he has sold this year have gone to foreign buyers, primarily from Canada and Australia. Last year, all of his investors were domestic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ryan Doherty, a 30-year-old apartment developer from Calgary, bought two of those leased-out suburban homes south of Chicago this year. He calls Mr. Workman weekly looking to purchase his next rental. "It's a good passive income opportunity," Mr. Doherty said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the flow of global capital into the U.S. housing market reflects several forces. Some Canadians, along with Brazilians and Chinese, worry that prices in their home market have gotten frothy. They are pulling some money out of that real estate market and investing in the U.S., where prices have already crashed. Some investors also believe they can earn higher returns by buying U.S. real estate, holding it as a rental, and then reselling it in the future for a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers from Venezuela, Russia, and Mexico are looking at trophy properties as a safe place to stash money amid perceptions of political uncertainty at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' survey said international purchases were equally split between foreign nonresidents and those who have recently immigrated or are temporary visa holders. Around four in 10 buyers plan to use houses here as their primary residence, while a similar share plan to use the homes as either vacation properties, income-generating rentals, or both, according to the Realtor survey. Many opt against living here for more than six months a year because of tax consequences, according to real-estate agents who specialize in sales to international buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign buyers "are either looking for safe havens or bargains, so we're seeing it at both ends of the spectrum," said Kenneth Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate Research at the University of California at Berkeley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of the U.S. dollar plays a big role in these decisions. Yves Gougoux, a 61-year-old advertising executive who lives in Montreal, plans to close Tuesday on an oceanfront home in Vero Beach, Fla. "I look around and see more and more French Canadians down here," said Mr. Gougoux, who plans to raze the $1.5 million property and build a home with a pool and gym. With the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar near parity, the price of the house comes to around 1.46 million Canadian dollars. Ten years ago, when one U.S. dollar bought 1.53 Canadian dollars, a $1.5 million home in the U.S. would have cost 2.29 million Canadian dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current exchange rates are giving foreign buyers "even greater purchasing power, never mind that prices are back to 2002 levels," said Sally Daley, the real-estate agent whose Florida firm represented Mr. Gougoux.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few markets are benefiting from the influx of foreign money as much as hard-hit Miami. In the city's downtown district, a backlog of roughly 25,000 luxury condos three years ago has been whittled down to just a few thousand. "We'll probably come out of this cycle in two years. It would have taken us five or six years if those Latin American buyers didn't show up," said Mark Pordes, chief executive of Pordes Residential, a brokerage in Aventura, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in Miami, down by half from their 2006 peak, turned up in recent months, rising 2.5% above their year-earlier level in March, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller home-price index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When they see the prices that we're selling at and they compare it to their home marketplace, they're like, 'This is a gift,' " said Harvey Hernandez, managing director of Newgard Group, a developer. For example, the price of an oceanfront condo in Rio de Janeiro is 50% above that for an equivalent condo in Miami.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hernandez launched sales last October on BrickellHouse, a new 374-unit Miami condo project that has signed sales agreements for more than 80% of its units, with around three of every four units going to foreign buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yvan Martinez, a 39-year-old real-estate attorney from Caracas, Venezuela, bought a second Miami property as a place to park his cash. "In Venezuela, economically and politically, there is no stability right now," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York and parts of California, developers and real estate agents also are looking to tap into a growing class of Chinese and Russian millionaires who are entering property markets. Wei Min Tan, a Manhattan real estate agent with Rutenberg Realty, represented a buyer from Singapore who narrowly lost out to a different foreign buyer on a $1.6 million condo in the city's Flatiron district. "People realize Manhattan prices are not going lower," said Mr. Tan, who says demand from foreigners has spiked in the past two months. Yan Yan Zhang, a real-estate agent in Beverly Hills, Calif., estimates that around one third of her sales are to Asian buyers. She has attended marketing events in Beijing organized to showcase luxury U.S. listings to affluent buyers. "They line up with $2 million cash ready to buy the right property," she said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>902 words</div><div>11 June 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A18</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most recent jobs report was weak, the leasing market is sluggish and the European economy is in tumult. But some real-estate investors, who have recently sold Manhattan office buildings, have proven that well-timed deals can still translate into big-time profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past year, several investors have resold or "flipped" major properties for about double what they paid during the downturn. That's helped cement the reputation of Manhattan real estate as a relatively safe asset even in tough economic times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also strengthened the argument for other owners to put properties up for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the most closely watched commercial-property offering in town, the owners of Worldwide Plaza have put that sprawling 1.8 million-square-foot tower at 825 Eighth Ave. on the block. The group, which includes <span class="companylink">George Comfort &amp; Sons Inc</span>. and RCG Longview, bought the half-empty building for about $600 million in 2009. Now that they've leased most of it up, they're hoping to fetch well over $1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, there is some question whether George Comfort will hit its target price. They point out that the global economic uncertainty has cooled demand for office space. But investor demand appears to be staying strong for office property with low-vacancy rates and long-term leases with healthy tenants. Even if these properties are producing yields in the 5% range, that's a lot more attractive to investors than many competing debt and equity investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take the case of Harbor Group International, which last month sold a 22-story office building at 4 New York Plaza for more than $265 million -- more than double the $107 million it paid for the Downtown tower two and a half years ago. "It caused some butterflies in our stomach," says Jordan Slone, Harbor Group's chief executive, of the decision to buy the building when the economic outlook was grim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harbor Group turned the building around by signing leases with the New York Daily News and <span class="companylink">American Media Inc</span>. Those deals also contributed to the sense that Downtown is becoming increasingly attractive to media companies. "People were very down on Lower Manhattan. It is really amazing in two and one-half years, how the market sentiment about Lower Manhattan has changed," Mr. Slone says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another investor, <span class="companylink">Rockpoint Group</span>, a Boston-based real-estate investment firm, has seen the value of a couple of buildings in which it purchased minority interests in 2010 nearly double.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last October, Rockpoint sold its 49% stake in Park Avenue Plaza, a 1.2 million-square-foot building at 55 E. 52nd St., whose blue-chip tenants include <span class="companylink">BlackRock Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">McKinsey &amp; Co</span>. The building was valued at $695 million when Rockpoint bought it in July 2010. The deal to sell the stake in 2011 valued the building at $1.19 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. Rockpoint also bought a 49% stake in 299 Park Ave., in January 2010, in a deal that valued the building at $615 million. Last August, it sold that interest in a deal that valued the building at $1.22 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even some investors who bought buildings near the peak are making a strong return if they succeeded in improving occupancy. Waterman Interests and <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Asset Management</span> recently sold an 88,000 square-foot building at 130 Prince St. for $140.5 million. They bought in the middle of 2007 for $112 million. The partners correctly bet on a big increase in tourist traffic which helped them land major retail leases with <span class="companylink">Cole Haan</span> and Barbour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far in 2012, office building sale volume has been low. Many owners have been unwilling to put their buildings on the block, even if they think they could fetch a good price. "The number one argument I've heard recently is, 'If I sell it, what do I buy?' No one wants stocks. No one wants bonds. What do you do with the money?" says Dan Fasulo of <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in other cases, investors are deciding to sell now because they fear the market is heading downward. A CBRE Global Investors fund purchased 1540 Broadway in March 2009 for $355 million, according to people familiar with the matter. It sold the building in two parts to Edge Fund Advisers on behalf of <span class="companylink">HSBC Alternative Investments Limited</span> in 2010 and September 2011 in a deal that valued the building at $680 million in total, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When CBRE Global Investors bought the Times Square tower it was only 78% leased and had gone through several owners in several years, according to Vance Maddocks, president of CBRE Strategic Partners U.S. After buying the building, CBRE Global Investors leased the top floors of the building to Xinhua, a Chinese state news agency, and <span class="companylink">Yahoo Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By last fall, Mr. Maddocks says, it was time to cash in, partly because he feared the Manhattan investment-sales market may take a downward turn: "If you look at the macro considerations [including] Europe or our [U.S.] fiscal situation, we always have an eye toward the downside. We're focused on the potential impacts of the economy on New York."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a windswept, icy day in October, an elite group of real-estate and gambling executives gathered at the 26-acre Westchester estate of commercial-property broker Barry Gosin for a fundraiser for Gov. Andrew Cuomo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A snowstorm hurled tree limbs across the driveway, delaying the governor's departure and handing two attendees -- <span class="companylink">Genting Bhd</span>. Chairman KT Lim and Genting's in-house lobbyist, Christian Goode -- a coveted opportunity to pitch Mr. Cuomo in person about their $4 billion vision for a casino resort at Aqueduct racetrack in Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For roughly 20 minutes, the governor and other guests huddled around a laptop on a dining table to watch a slide show presentation of the Malaysian gambling giant's ambitious bid, according to guests who were present. By December, Mr. Cuomo was fully supportive of casino gambling. By January, the heart of Genting's plan was the splashiest feature of his economic agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The meeting at Mr. Gosin's house illustrates how casino interests were intent on wooing Mr. Cuomo as he formed a second-year agenda. About a month later, the industry made at least $2 million in donations to the Committee to Save New York, a group closely allied with the governor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The money helped finance campaign-style television and radio advertisements touting Mr. Cuomo and his broad agenda but didn't specifically promote gambling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Josh Vlasto, a spokesman for the governor, declined to confirm or deny anything that happened at the fundraiser. A spokesman for Genting also declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talks between the Cuomo administration and Genting -- which already operates a video gambling operation at Aqueduct -- over the proposed deal broke down abruptly last week. Mr. Cuomo has since said the process for choosing a new casino in New York City will be "open."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before the fundraiser, the governor had signaled he was receptive to the idea of legalizing casino gambling. The fundraiser at Mr. Gosin's provided perhaps the only known instances in which the casino industry gained face-to-face access with the governor on the topic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Genting executives had been invited to the fundraiser by one of the event's co-hosts, Jeffrey R. Gural, a real-estate executive who owns a pair of upstate "racinos" -- racetracks with video lottery terminals that have been lobbying for the exclusive right to develop casinos in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I thought it would be a good idea to meet the governor," said Mr. Gural, the chairman of <span class="companylink">Newmark Knight Frank</span>, a commercial real-estate firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also attending the fundraiser was one of Mr. Cuomo's closest political advisers, Jennifer Cunningham, a public-relations consultant whose firm, SKD Knickerbocker, was hired by Genting and the New York Gaming Association. She isn't a registered lobbyist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gural described Genting's slide show presentation to the governor as "spectacular."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gural said the governor seemed receptive to the plan and told the Genting executives to brief his economic development advisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While other attendees at the fundraiser donated to Mr. Cuomo's political campaign, including Mr. Gural, Genting didn't contribute directly to the governor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Genting is an important financial backer of the New York Gaming Association, which made the $2 million donation to the Committee to Save New York in early December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're not going to have any comment on any of the supposed donations," said Stefan Friedman, a spokesman for Genting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cuomo administration, initially, didn't disclose the existence of the fundraiser on the governor's official calendar. The governor's office has said that the publicly released schedules -- published online on a site called CitizenConnects -- includes all meetings with lobbyists and fundraisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regarding what matters would be disclosed, Mr. Cuomo said in a radio interview in September: "These are actual schedules. . . . You wouldn't reveal things that are counterproductive to what you're trying to do or a breach of privacy. But legislators, lobbyists, public meetings, official meetings, you know, that's what's all there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barbara Bartoletti, executive director of the League of Women Voters of New York State, said the fundraiser and Genting slide show "certainly sounds like lobbying. . . . Certainly, something like that should have been completely disclosed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, after The Wall Street Journal inquired about the event, the governor's office amended the October calendar to say that Mr. Cuomo had a private fundraiser in Westchester on Oct. 29. But the schedule still makes no mention of Genting's face-to-face pitch to Mr. Cuomo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vlasto, the governor's spokesman, said the omission was "inadvertent."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York still has substantial hurdles before casino gambling outside of Indian reservations is legalized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state Legislature passed a constitutional amendment this year allowing seven commercial casinos. The bill must be passed again by the next session of the Legislature and then approved in a public referendum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Genting proposal would have created the nation's largest convention center and a casino resort. The company wanted to secure the exclusive rights to run a casino in New York City by offering a transformative development project in the form of a convention center. The plan also would have opened the land under the <span class="companylink">Javits Center</span> to new development.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the largest failed real-estate development projects during the U.S. boom is showing signs of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors sunk about $1.9 billion to build a megaretail and entertainment complex in New Jersey known as Meadowlands Xanadu, only to see the project stall before completion in 2009 and sit idle ever since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada-based <span class="companylink">Triple Five</span> Group, which got involved with the project in late 2010, has cut a tentative deal with <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span> to provide an approximately $700 million loan to resuscitate and expand the project, according to people familiar with the matter. <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>, which intends to sell some of the loan, would provide a key piece of financing for a $1.7 billion-plus effort to finish the giant mall and indoor ski slope and build a sprawling amusement and water park, renamed the American Dream Meadowlands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Triple Five</span>, which built the Mall of America in Minnesota, also expects to take control of the site within weeks from a group of onetime lenders, the people said. The group controls the property after seizing the project in 2010. The lender group, which includes <span class="companylink">Capmark Financial Group</span> and <span class="companylink">Northstar Realty Finance Corp</span>., brought in <span class="companylink">Triple Five</span>, but the developer repeatedly has pushed off completing the deal until it made more progress with other portions of the project, the people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developer still faces numerous hurdles before work resumes on the project, a mostly complete shopping and entertainment complex with a colorful exterior five miles from Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Triple Five</span> still must secure an array of approvals from local and federal agencies for the expanded amusements it is planning and raise hundreds of millions of dollars in other forms of financing. It also needs to make progress leasing its retail space. Executives have declined to say how many tenants have been secured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the move to take control of the property and the large commitment by a lender, at a time when construction financing throughout the country is scarce, are big steps for what would be one of the largest real-estate developments in the country. "We're getting to the point where there's light at the end of tunnel," said Wayne Hasenbalg, president of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, the state agency that owns the land under the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should it be able to move forward, <span class="companylink">Triple Five</span> plans to import the template it used in Minnesota and for its entertainment-heavy, 5.4-million-square-foot West Edmonton Mall. By expanding the amusement portion of the project, the company wants to make it more of a destination, drawing throngs of tourists and locals to the area. This would augment its 1.7 million square feet of retail space, which would be one of the largest malls in the area. In all, the company has said it expects 55 million visitors a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joanna Seddon, a consultant to <span class="companylink">Triple Five</span> and president of global brand strategy at Ogilvy &amp; Mather, predicts the project will lure residents and tourists with a higher-end, more varied mix of retail than at other regional malls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are a lot of malls in New Jersey; they're all pretty much the same," she said. "There is a niche in the market that is not filled."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, others who have looked at the property said it is a challenging project given its size, and it may be difficult to lure tens of millions of visitors a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paco Underhill, chief executive of retail consulting firm <span class="companylink">Envirosell Inc</span>. who advised Tampa-based DeBartolo Development in its failed bid to revive the project, said there already are plentiful alternatives in New York City and northern New Jersey for entertainment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I ask how many IMAX [movie] screens are within a 10-mile radius of Xanadu," Mr. Underhill said. "There is an astonishing cross section of them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The closely held <span class="companylink">Triple Five</span>, owned by the Ghermezian family, marks the third developer on the project. It was begun by the Mills Corp. a decade ago and subsequently by a group of equity investors including <span class="companylink">Colony Capital LLC</span>. Collectively, with a group of lenders, they put about $1.9 billion into the project. They hit cost overruns and delays, and the project ultimately was brought to a halt when one lender stopped funding construction. The group of lenders would participate in any profits with <span class="companylink">Triple Five</span>, people familiar with the agreement said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Triple Five</span>'s next step for financing the project is to find equity investors, a step for which it has enlisted <span class="companylink">Macquarie Group Ltd</span>. as adviser. And it is seeking as much as $500 million in bond financing backed by future sales tax and property tax revenue.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO -- Land prices in sections of Tokyo and other major Japanese cities continued to rise in the first three months of the year as large commercial developments supported the market, a trend that has drawn fresh interest in the country's property market from global investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices were seen in bellwether parts of central Tokyo, such as the upmarket Ginza shopping district and the Toyosu waterfront residential area, as well parts of Nagoya and Osaka, a government survey showed Wednesday. But other areas remain caught in the long-term decline dating back to the early 1990s collapse of the country's bubble economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quarterly survey of residential and commercial land prices by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism showed that among 150 urban areas, prices rose in 22, up from 16 in the previous survey. Prices were flat in 80 areas, up from 70 in the previous survey, and fell in 48 areas, down from 64.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result marked the second consecutive quarter that prices were steady or showed gains in more than half of surveyed areas, the longest since the three quarters through June 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Land prices rose in Ginza as foreign tourists returned after last year's earthquake and nuclear crisis, and as large fashion stores opened, the report showed. Tokyo's Shibuya, a shopping and entertainment district popular with Japanese youth, saw prices rise because of several large-scale redevelopment projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some residential areas of the western city of Osaka, prices were buoyed by strong demand from developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Although the broad trend of gradually declining land prices is continuing. . .there are signs that it is turning around," the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. plans to launch a private real-estate investment trust in Japan this summer amid signs of an improvement in the Tokyo property market. That would be the first time the U.S. financial giant has invested in Tokyo properties through its asset-management arm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Takashi Ishizawa, chief real-estate analyst at Mizuho Securities, said urban land prices are likely to improve in coming months, but only slowly, as fresh supply of office space in central Tokyo puts pressure on rents and because the residential condominium market has lost some momentum after a recovery from the March 2011 disasters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ishizawa said gains in urban land prices won't necessarily lead higher prices across the rest of Japan, as the gap in demand between metropolitan areas and rural areas is widening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japanese land prices rose in 2007 and 2008 after having fallen for a decade and a half. Prices started falling again in 2009 as the world economy was hit by the global financial crisis.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel   </div><div>598 words</div><div>30 May 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A18</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is an address along Central Park worth? A new report finds that the price of the typical apartment sold in buildings that border New York's most famous swatch of green was more than double that for apartments in surrounding neighborhoods last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price difference is even greater for co-ops on the park, according to the study by real-estate data firm PropertyShark.com, with those prices three times higher along the park than in co-ops in surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report said the gaps were the largest reported since 2008, when the real estate boom came crashing down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Central Park is both a great tourist attraction and a huge real estate engine," the report said. "Living close to the park is something that almost every homebuyer would wish for."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a number of brokers pointed to the resurgence of the waterfront and nearby neighborhoods that may eventually reduce the premium paid for shelter on park-lined blocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report compared sales of all apartments in buildings along the park with all sales in the same ZIP Codes. It didn't take into account differences in size of co-ops, since many listings didn't provide square footage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It found that the median apartment sale price on the park border was $1.85 million last year, compared with $850,000 for the park's surrounding ZIP Codes as a whole, which include most of the Upper East and West Sides. That works out to a 118% premium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median co-op price was $2.4 million compared with $795,000 for the surrounding ZIP Codes, a 202% premium for Central Park properties. In 2008, when sales of more expensive properties surged, the differential was 233%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo prices, which can vary widely as sales in new buildings begin closings, saw a premium of only 3% overall and 4% on a square-foot basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc., said that in many other cities, there is "a heavier premium" for views looking out over water, at a harbor or a river than for apartments in the middle of the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For being such an outgoing and outspoken culture here, we are very inward looking," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beth Fisher, a senior managing director at the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, said buildings on the park are centrally located and internationally known, giving them huge advantages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Fisher, who oversees sales at two large developments, the Aldyn and the Rushmore on Riverside Boulevard on the West Side, said public and private investments have reclaimed riverfronts across New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are definitely people -- New Yorkers as well as people from across the globe -- who prefer river views where the air is fresh and pure," she said. "Some people don't want to be in the heart of New York."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calin Onet, a marketing manager and analyst at PropertyShark, said that buildings facing Central Park and the open skies above have one enduring advantage: no new buildings would ever be built in front of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said that New York real estate is the most local of markets, with prices and status varying from building to building. So it isn't surprising that some of New York's priciest sales aren't on the park. But such chart-topping sales, including a recent contract for more than $90 million at One57 on West 57th Street, often include a Central Park view as well, she said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan   </div><div>540 words</div><div>30 May 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have stopped falling or are falling at a slower pace in many cities across the country. One notable exception is Atlanta, where home-price declines accelerated in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, sale prices of single-family homes fell an average of 1.9% in the first quarter, compared with a year earlier, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price index out Tuesday. The decline in the index, which tracks prices in 20 metropolitan areas, was smaller than in previous periods and seemed to indicate that home-price declines are hitting bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the Atlanta metropolitan area, home prices plunged 17.7% in March. That marked the 21st consecutive month of year-over-year declines in Atlanta home values and the largest drop of any city in the index. The second-largest average price decline was in Las Vegas, where prices fell 7.5%. Among the 20 cities in the Case-Shiller index, 13 saw declines in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Atlanta Realtors say they have seen signs recently that sales are picking up. They also point out that the Case-Shiller data lags behind actual market trends by several months. "Their numbers are more in line with what we were seeing a few months ago," said Mitch Kaminer, president of the Atlanta Board of Realtors and a broker with Re/Max Paramount Properties in Atlanta. "It's been the best spring season in five years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Atlanta market-watchers and real-estate agents say the price declines are driven by several factors, including many foreclosures, a glut of housing inventory left over from the real-estate boom and unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You'd think we'd be getting through this by now. But you're not going to start moving this property until people have jobs," said Michael Bell, a professor of public policy at Georgia State University and the former chief financial officer of DeKalb County, which includes a portion of Atlanta and the city's northeastern suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta's unemployment rate has hovered above 11% for much of the past year, even as the national jobless rate has fallen to 8.1%, according to the Georgia Department of Labor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state leads the nation in bank failures, with 78 lending institutions closed since mid-2008, many because of profligate lending to home builders during the real-estate boom. The result has been hundreds of thousands of vacant or half-finished lots and tens of thousands of homes lost to foreclosure in the suburbs. RealtyTrac, an Irvine, Calif., provider of foreclosure data, reported this month that Atlanta's rate of foreclosure sales -- typically when buyers lose their homes to their lender or at a courthouse auction -- has remained steady at about 8,000 a month for the past two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Atlanta's going to take longer [to recover]. It was just horribly overbuilt," said Richard Smith, chief executive of Realogy Corp., which owns the Coldwell Banker and Century 21 brands.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices across the U.S. fell in March, but not as much as in earlier months, according to a report Tuesday that offered fresh evidence of a real-estate market on the mend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with February, prices fell just 0.03% in March, and after adjusting for seasonal factors, they rose 0.09%, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller 20-city home-price index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is the first flat report we've had in quite some time," said David M. Blitzer, chairman of the Index Committee at S&amp;P Indices. Still, "while there has been improvement in some regions, housing prices have not turned" everywhere, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a measure of the housing slump's severity that a flat index in March is seen as good news; prices are down roughly 35% from their peak in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five cities -- Atlanta, Chicago, Las Vegas, New York and Portland, Ore. -- still saw average prices hit new lows since the financial crisis. Home prices in Atlanta fell the most over the year at 17.7%. Phoenix, by contrast, posted a gain of 6.1%, the largest in the index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average sale prices of single-family homes declined 1.9% in the first quarter from a year ago, according to the Case-Shiller national composite index. Prices dropped 2% in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The March data raised hopes that the current quarter -- the important spring selling season -- is luring buyers confident that prices have reached bottom. Last week, the National Association of Realtors reported sales of previously owned homes increased 3.4% in April from a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The worst is over," said Christopher Mayer, a real-estate professor at Columbia Business School.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research and forecasting firm Capital Economics echoed that sentiment, saying, "U.S. house prices have now found a floor."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, sellers willing to list their homes at prices down sharply from their peak six years ago are finding more offers than they did last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last fall, "nothing moved," said Jeff Pintar, a Dana Point, Calif., real-estate investor, who resells foreclosed properties he buys from banks in five Southern California counties. That has changed, he said, with most homes now selling within a week. "The market is stabilizing," he said. "Prices have continued to fall and fall and fall, but right around December buying activity and renting activity really picked up at a pace we haven't seen in several years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say that is because of improved economic conditions, including a better job market and looser credit. Seven cities -- Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Miami, Minneapolis, Phoenix and Charlotte, N.C. -- posted sales growth compared with last year. Still, the Case-Shiller index of 10 major metropolitan areas was down 2.8% in March from a year earlier. The 20-city index was off 2.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yale University economist Robert Shiller was cautious, pointing to the European crisis and uncertainty about government's continued role in guaranteeing mortgages. "There is a good chance we'll be down for a year," he said. "There is too much uncertainty."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers seem to share his pessimism. A consumer-confidence survey released Tuesday by the Conference Board, a business-research firm, fell to 64.9 in May, a four-month low. It was down from 68.7 in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a conference call to discuss the housing report, economist Karl Case was markedly brighter than Mr. Shiller, with whom he founded the index measuring home prices in a three-month moving average. "This period of postboom malaise has lasted a long time now," Mr. Case said. "There is nothing but good news since April."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As home buyers come into the market, some are discovering that the sustained declines of the past five years are giving them an opportunity to buy in places that were once out of reach. "We never really thought we could afford a house in the Bay Area on one income," said Katie Kirsch, who with her husband, Sean, a member of the Air Force, bought a four-bedroom home in Livermore, Calif., this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, they put in unsuccessful offers on four other properties in the San Jose area, including one that sold for nearly 18% above its $489,000 asking price. "There aren't very many homes for sale, and so a lot of them are selling way above the listing price," Ms. Kirsch said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes continued to pick up momentum, another sign that the long-beleaguered housing market is in recovery mode.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales for April rose 3.3% from March and were up 9.9% from a year earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 343,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While new homes account for about 10% of the housing stock sold each year, sales of previously owned homes have also shown strong gains recently, suggesting the industry's improvements are widespread. The National Association of Realtors said Tuesday that sales of previously owned homes, which make up the bulk of the housing market, rose 3.4% in April from the previous month. The Commerce Department figures reflect sales of only single-family homes, while the Realtor data include sales within multifamily dwellings, such as condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are also improving. The median price for a new home in April was $235,700, up slightly from March and nearly 5% higher compared with a year earlier, according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The string of upbeat news has prompted some economists to become more optimistic about the sector. In a note to clients on Wednesday, Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote that "a slow recovery is getting underway." Still, some analysts and economists had expected even stronger new-home sales, given the double-digit increases in orders by the large publicly traded home builders in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luxury builder <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. said Wednesday that its contracts for the quarter ended April 30 were up 47% from a year earlier. The National Association of Home Builders this month reported that confidence among home builders hit a five-year high in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the pace of April's new-home sales remains far below historical levels: Since 1963, 671,000 new single-family homes were sold per year in the U.S., on average. Plus, the nascent recovery could be derailed should the economy stumble, interest rates increase or inventory swell -- for instance, as banks seek to unload more foreclosed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report showed that 146,000 new homes were listed for sale at the end of April, a supply that would take 5.1 months to deplete at the current sales pace. Only 46,000 new homes were completed in April, the lowest number on record, though dwindling inventories could boost future building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> said Wednesday its monthly home-price index showed that home prices rose 1.8% on a seasonally adjusted basis in March from a month earlier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe's Workers Need More Mobility</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe's debt crisis has a mounting human cost: Euro-zone unemployment stands at a 15-year high, and the OECD forecasts it will rise to 11.1% by the end of next year, from just over 10% now, as gross domestic product in the currency bloc shrinks by an expected 0.1% this year. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi says the solution is overhauls to address labor-market flexibility, mobility and equity. Long-overdue overhauls are addressing flexibility. But low European labor mobility is a tougher challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe's unemployment problem should be manageable: Joblessness today across the euro zone isn't far above the quarterly average since 1993 of 9.4%. Given the scale of the crisis, it might have been expected to be higher. But unemployment has diverged between countries. In Germany, joblessness at 5.6% is the lowest in 20 years, and employers report difficulties in hiring skilled workers. But in Greece, it is 21.7%; in Ireland, 14.5%, and in Spain, 24.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ideally, workers could take advantage of the single market to move to countries where labor is in demand. But the average annual cross-border mobility rate in the European Union is 0.2%, compared with interstate mobility of 2%-2.5% in the U.S., a 2008 European Commission study found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Language and cultural barriers are a major problem: Knowledge of English is widespread, with 38% of European Union citizens having sufficient skills to conduct a conversation, according to a 2005 Eurobarometer survey. But only 14% speak French and German as a second language, and 6% Spanish. English is valuable for skilled or white-collar jobs, but mastery of local languages could be more important for lower-skilled jobs. Meanwhile, 44% of Europeans said they could speak only their mother tongue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even within countries, mobility may be limited. Countries that saw construction booms, like Spain and Ireland, or relied on government spending, like Greece, need to overhaul their growth models. It will take time to retrain workers to move into export-sector jobs, and the housing crash, debt overhang and banking woes make moving their homes difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Young people face particular challenges. In Spain and Greece, youth unemployment is now more than 50%. Those who experience unemployment early in life are more likely to be unemployed again in later years, and the earnings gap versus those who find jobs can be as high as 20% and last for 20 years, the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labor mobility should be an important force for economic adjustment, particularly in a currency union where exchange-rate adjustment is impossible. But it is hard to see how policy makers can address Europe's language challenge, beyond investing in education. This will take time to bear fruit, while the human cost continues to rise.</p>

<span class="companylink">Vodafone</span>'s Not Down and Out in Europe</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Vodafone</span> is having its own European crisis. The mobile giant announced a GBP 4 billion ($6.3 billion) write-down of Southern European operations, more than the proceeds it made from long-awaited asset sales last year. <span class="companylink">Vodafone</span> says some people in Greece and Spain are even giving up mobile phones to save money. Its cash flows are vulnerable to the euro weakening against the pound. Still, <span class="companylink">Vodafone</span> is in good shape to manage its European woes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Vodafone</span> has taken a battering after cutting prices in recession-hit countries. Sales in Spain fell 7%, and in Greece, 6%, in the 52 weeks to the end of March. This year, <span class="companylink">Vodafone</span> admits it could miss previous targets for 1%-4% group revenue growth. It expects free cash flows of just GBP 5.3 billion-GBP 5.8 billion, well below last year's GBP 6.1 billion. Even these may prove optimistic, as they assume the pound -- in which <span class="companylink">Vodafone</span> pays its dividend -- will remain broadly flat against the dollar and euro, in which it earns most of its revenue. And while <span class="companylink">Vodafone</span> transfers cash made across the group back to the U.K. in sterling, it can do little to insulate itself from a possible euro breakup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, <span class="companylink">Vodafone</span> looks well-placed to absorb the current pain in Europe. Its operations in Greece, Spain and Portugal make up less than 6% of group enterprise value, estimates <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>. Normal currency swings look manageable. And if cash flows fall faster than expected, <span class="companylink">Vodafone</span> can pull other levers to maintain this year's 6 billion euro ($7.69 billion) capital expenditure and targeted 7% dividend growth: Net debt is historically low at just 1.7 times Ebitda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides, weakness in Europe is being offset by strength in Turkey, India, and, most notably, the U.S., via <span class="companylink">Vodafone</span>'s 45% stake in joint venture <span class="companylink">Verizon Wireless</span>. Here, revenue grew a healthy 7.3% last year. The U.S. contributes almost as much to <span class="companylink">Vodafone</span>'s profits as Europe does. Yet at 10.4 times forward earnings, <span class="companylink">Vodafone</span> trades at a huge discount to its U.S. partner, <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications</span>, at 16.5 times, according to FactSet data. That could prove too much of a European markdown.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. Recovery</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hits Home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Season</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evidence of a recovery in the U.S. housing market has been piling up since last fall, but there has been a good reason to be skeptical of it: Data from the cold months, when housing activity slows, are a less-than-certain gauge of the market's health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now the U.S. is entering the thick of the home-building and -selling season. And the data continue to flash recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjusted for seasonal swings, an annualized 4.62 million previously owned homes were sold in April, the National Association of Realtors reported Tuesday. That was the best month since January and 10.5% better than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because April is when sales start to heat up, the figures were adjusted downward. Unadjusted, 400,000 homes were sold last month -- 4.8 million at an annual pace. With the exception of 2010, when federal home-buyer tax credits inflated sales, it was the strongest April since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other housing data are also having a good spring. Last week, the Commerce Department reported that ground was broken on 45,800 new single-family homes in April, not seasonally adjusted, up 21% from a year earlier and the most since April 2010. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>' measure of foot traffic from people shopping for new homes this month hit its highest level in over five years. Average prices for framing lumber are 33% higher than a year ago, according to lumber-industry newsletter Random Lengths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of which is good news for the shares of home builders, which in recent years have been in the habit of rolling over in the summer. It is good news for the broader market, too: A housing market in recovery could be just the cure for the summertime blues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Justin Lahart</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overheard</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, George Osborne took a political hit for friend Christine Lagarde by agreeing to boost the U.K.'s contribution to the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> by GBP 10 billion ($15.83 billion). On Tuesday, the IMF chief repaid the compliment by not only praising the U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer's handling of the economy but by urging that the Bank of England do more to provide cheap long-term funding to the U.K. banking system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In doing so, Ms. Lagarde intervened in a major row. The Treasury is concerned the BOE's dogmatic approach to bank funding has choked off the U.K. recovery. Only the day before, the BOE agreed to an external review of its liquidity operations, partly in response to Treasury pressure. If Ms. Lagarde's support helps soften BOE resistance, Mr. Osborne may consider his GBP 10 billion as money well spent.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes rose at a robust clip in April -- and prices jumped -- the latest indications that the housing market is recovering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales were up 3.4% from March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.62 million, the National Association of Realtors trade group said Tuesday. If the pace holds, 2012 could be the strongest year for home sales since 2007, just after the housing boom. The median home price, meanwhile, increased 10.1% from a year earlier to $177,400, the strongest year-to-year gain since January 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the higher median price reflects rising values and a shift toward fewer sales of foreclosed homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The higher sales are further confirmation that the industry is experiencing the best spring since 2010, when home-buyer tax credits boosted demand. Sales improved partly thanks to strong demand from investors. But they were also helped by traditional buyers who are feeling more confident about the economy and are ready to take advantage of low interest rates and bargain prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While prices are starting to rise, they remain significantly lower than a few years ago. Last week, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said average rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages dropped to 3.79% for the week ending May 16. In 2005, at the height of the housing boom, some 30-year rates topped 6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Money is really cheap," said Mark Jacobson, director of strategy for <span class="companylink">Microsoft Corp</span>., who says he is ready to buy a home in Seattle's Mercer Island after looking for two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's report held signs that conditions are inching closer to normal: Foreclosures and other distressed properties, which have dragged down prices in recent years, accounted for 28% of April's sales -- down slightly from March and a steep drop from 37% a year earlier. First-time buyers, who have struggled with tightened lending standards in recent months, made up 35% of April's purchasers, up from 33% in March and down slightly from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Erica Rose Siegel, an agent with Exit Kingdom Realty in Queens, N.Y., said she is seeing increased interest from buyers ready to trade up. "People just feel like they've been in their space for a while," she said. "They're saying, 'If I don't do this now, I might not be able to afford it' " down the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, real-estate agents say the housing recovery could easily stall if inventory swells -- for instance as banks seek to unload more foreclosed properties -- if interest rates rise, or if the economy stumbles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further data will come Wednesday when the Census Bureau reports sales of newly built homes.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi </div><div>763 words</div><div>23 May 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office investors are beginning to trickle back into downtown Los Angeles as a rising number of residents, restaurants and glitzy entertainment options bring new zest to the city's once-overlooked core.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the rebound in the office market downtown remains weak compared with the growth of the area's night life and residential population. The rise in office property values continues to lag behind the region's prime office markets in places like West Los Angeles, Santa Monica and Beverly Hills that still are favored by tenants and big investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider the deal that is in the works for 400 South Hope St., a 1980s-vintage tower a few blocks from the Frank Gehry-designed <span class="companylink">Walt Disney</span> Concert Hall. CBRE Global Investors has agreed to pay about $236 million to buy the 26-story tower from a venture of Tishman Speyer Properties and asset manager <span class="companylink">BlackRock Inc</span>., according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That price, which equates to about $337 a square foot, is still shy of the roughly $351 a square foot that Tishman Speyer and BlackRock paid in 2005. Downtown Los Angeles office buildings sold for as much as $450 a square foot at the peak in 2007, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a real-estate research firm. By comparison, prices for the best buildings in the strongest markets in the Los Angeles region as well as the rest of the country are approaching record highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If any central business district is lagging, it's Los Angeles," says Dan Fasulo, a Real Capital managing director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downtown Los Angeles market has long suffered higher vacancy rates than other office markets in the region. Its office towers were home to a vibrant international banking center in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but downtown was hurt by overbuilding, the recession of the early 1990s and consolidation in the financial-services industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downtown market strengthened during the boom years leading up to the latest recession, but it got blasted again with the financial crisis, according to Steve Marcussen, executive director with Cushman &amp; Wakefield in Los Angeles. Downtown Los Angeles's first-quarter office vacancy rate stood at 15.5%, above the 13.2% rate in West Los Angeles, 10.3% in Santa Monica and 8.7% in Beverly Hills, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 700,000-square-foot building at 400 South Hope, which formerly was named the Mellon Bank Center, is 80% leased, according to people familiar with the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news downtown continues to be the rebirth of entertainment and other uses dating back to the Staples Center's opening in 1999. Developers since then have converted older office buildings into residential properties, and downtown's residential population more than doubled to nearly 50,000, according to Carol Schatz, president of the Central City Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, arts and entertainment oriented buildings have opened downtown such as the <span class="companylink">Walt Disney</span> Concert Hall and the sprawling LA Live entertainment complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, a push is under way to build a National Football League stadium downtown. "Now . . . downtown's dominated by entertainment and tourism," says Mr. Marcussen. "We have a purpose again."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While office investors haven't flocked back to the city, they certainly are taking notice. During the depths of the downturn, downtown office deal activity ground to a halt with no large office building transactions in 2009 and only $211 million in 2010, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, this year is off to a decent start with $254 million in deals in the first quarter, although it still is well off the pace of the $3.4 billion in sales rung up in 2007 overall at the peak of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other parts of the city are enjoying more demand from technology, entertainment and other office tenants. But the declining availability of space and increasing rents in these markets work to downtown Los Angeles's benefit. Last year, the Gensler architectural firm relocated into about 53,000 square feet of downtown space from Santa Monica.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CBRE Global Investors is the investment-management unit of <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>. CBRE's brokerage arm represented the seller in the sale of 400 South Hope. The company keeps the two operations separate to prevent conflicts of interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other sales downtown this year include the purchase of the PacMutual building by a venture of veteran developer Nelson Rising for $60 million.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Blackstone Lodges More Hotel Deals --- Private-Equity Firm Adds Properties, Revamps Others, as Industry Recovers</span>
</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson and Craig Karmin </div><div>718 words</div><div>23 May 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C11</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span>, one of the world's largest hotel investors, is playing both offense and defense these days as the lodging industry slowly recovers from the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On offense, the private-equity giant continues to load up on new properties. Blackstone on Tuesday agreed to buy the Motel 6 discount lodging chain from the French hotel company <span class="companylink">Accor SA</span> in a deal valued at $1.9 billion. The transaction mirrored an acquisition by Blackstone earlier this month of a $606 million mortgage coming due on the 13-hotel Eagle Hospitality portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, Blackstone has been shoring up the balance sheets of major hotel purchases it made before the bust. In the latest example of such a defensive move, the firm restructured and pared down the debt on the <span class="companylink">La Quinta Corp</span>. chain that it purchased in 2006 for $3.4 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blackstone's deal engine is getting stoked by its success at fundraising. The firm has raised more than $10 billion for a real-estate fund that could reach $12 billion by year-end. Blackstone has been using that cash to buy and restructure a wide range of property types including office, retail and industrial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it has a sweet spot for hotels these days, believing that at this point in the cycle lodgings are benefiting from rising room rates and little new supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blackstone also owns Hilton Worldwide Inc. and a large stake in Extended Stay Inc. Once the Motel 6 deal closes, scheduled for October, the firm's properties will range in price from the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan, where single rooms currently start at $419, to the Motel 6 in Avoca, Iowa, near exit 40 of Interstate-80, which was charging $49.99.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Motel 6 chain counts more than 1,000 hotels, including 604 of its own properties and 483 franchise assets. Blackstone plans to upgrade the Motel 6 properties it is acquiring and expand the franchise base, according to a Blackstone executive. The acquisition price breaks down to about $25,000 per room, which analysts say is below replacement cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides buying hotels directly, Blackstone has been adding to its portfolio by taking advantage of the distress of others. In the Eagle deal, Blackstone this month agreed to pay roughly $465 million for a $606 million mortgage coming due in September on the 13-hotel portfolio, according to people familiar with the matter. The seller was the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>-controlled Maiden Lane fund, which inherited several loans from Bear Stearns Co. when the Fed brokered the failed investment bank's sale to <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Eagle portfolio was bought by real-estate fund manager <span class="companylink">AREA Property Partners</span> in 2007. The mortgage comes due in September, and Blackstone's purchase amounts to a bet that AREA will fail to refinance, pay or extend the loan, allowing Blackstone to foreclose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As a fiduciary, we are ensuring that the company explores all options to protect the interests of all stakeholders, including a restructuring of the debt before the maturity this fall," said an AREA representative. "The company is currently meeting its debt service obligations and expects to do so through maturity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blackstone's cash also has come in handy when restructuring its post-downturn deals. To restructure the debt on the 822-hotel La Quinta chain, the firm paid down $150 million in debt and went into the market and bought $265 million in junior debt and retired it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, Blackstone extended the $2.65 billion in debt outstanding to July 2014 by agreeing to pay an interest rate 3.5 percentage points higher than under the previous terms. That debt, which was mostly carved up into commercial mortgage-backed securities and sold to investors, had been due to expire in July 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The La Quinta restructuring is similar to what Blackstone did with its only larger hotel holding, <span class="companylink">Hilton Worldwide</span>, in 2010. Blackstone spent roughly $800 million to buy $2 billion of Hilton's debt at a discount and retire it. It then converted other debt to preferred equity.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The percentage of American homeowners behind on their mortgage payments fell during the first quarter to the lowest level since the end of 2008. But the share of loans in foreclosure remains stubbornly high, according to a survey Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of March, 11.8% of all loans were at least 30 days past due or in foreclosure, the report from the Mortgage Bankers Association said. While that is still high by historical standards, it has improved steadily over the past two years, falling from 12.8% a year ago and 14.7% two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in the share of homeowners late on payments was due almost entirely to fewer new cases of delinquency, a sign that households' finances are improving. The percentage of borrowers behind on their mortgage but not in foreclosure fell to 7.4% at the end of March from 8.3% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The drops we continue to see there are the best news out of this. It indicates the speed with which we're working through the backlog" of bad loans, said Jay Brinkmann, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association. The survey covers about 88% of all U.S. mortgages, or about 43 million loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department said construction starts on new housing jumped 2.6% in April to a higher-than-expected annual rate of 717,000, suggesting that home-building continues to improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures, however, remain a concern. Although banks initiated fewer foreclosures in the first quarter than at any time since 2007, the share of loans in the process remains high. Some 4.4% of mortgages were in some stage of foreclosure at the end of March, unchanged from the previous quarter and down only slightly from 4.5% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers mask big variations by state. The national foreclosure rate remains elevated largely because of states that require banks to process foreclosures through the courts. In these so-called judicial states, banks have moved to take back homes very slowly since judges uncovered record-keeping abuses 18 months ago. Banks have encountered fewer hurdles in nonjudicial states.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[An $85 million L.A. mansion with a 500-worker renovation team. A $70 million London home. Two heiresses are swiftly amassing a global property portfolio -- and they're part of a new generation of young, ultra-wealthy buyers.]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some kids cost a fortune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a real estate shopping spree of epic proportions, the daughters of Formula 1 Racing boss Bernie Ecclestone have snapped up hundreds of millions of dollars worth of high-profile properties in the past 18 months. Tamara, 27, bought a 16,000-square-foot historic brick home across the road from Kensington Palace, where Prince William and Duchess Catherine will soon take up residence, for about $70 million early last year. Her 23-year-old sister Petra paid $85 million for a 57,000-square-foot Los Angeles mansion a few months later. Known as "the Manor," the 14-bedroom, 27-bathroom home was built by Candy Spelling and her late TV producer husband Aaron Spelling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sisters are among a small number of ultra-wealthy, young people who are making waves at the very top of the real estate market. A trust linked to Ekaterina Rybolovlev, the 22-year-old daughter of Russian fertilizer billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, bought a four-bedroom penthouse in New York for $88 million earlier this year. Another young Russian, Anna Anissimova, the 27-year-old actress daughter of Vasily Anissimov, who made his billions in iron ore and aluminum, recently put her New York apartment on the market for $50 million. (She paid $9.9 million for the apartment in 2004, when she was 19.) Megan Ellison, the 26-year-old daughter of software mogul and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, bought three homes in the Hollywood Hills over the last few years, one of which she put on the market recently for $15.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it was Petra's purchase of the Spelling mansion that "changed the perception of who a buyer could be," said Rick Hilton, who represented both Ms. Stunt and Ms. Spelling in the sale, noting that he now looks at younger buyers much more seriously. He added that Petra's desire to buy such a statement home surprised him, considering her age. "At first, I showed her several properties but they weren't grand enough," he remembered, including a 36,000-square-foot French-style mansion on Sunset Boulevard now listed for $49.5 million. "When those earlier homes didn't excite her, I saw very quickly that . . . she wanted the finest estate available, and that's what she got."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ecclestone sisters exemplify the way many of the ultra-wealthy, and ultra-young, buy real estate. They often make up their minds quickly. They like to customize their homes to their highly specific tastes, on a quick turnaround with few expenses spared. Petra Stunt, who married entrepreneur James Stunt last August, negotiated the deal to buy her Los Angeles home the week after she saw it. And she recently moved in following an extensive 12-week renovation, an unusually short turnaround for a job of that magnitude. Ms. Ecclestone's Kensington home is also being finished on an accelerated timetable, according to the builder, about half the typical time frame for a project of that scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the sisters are sometimes portrayed in the British press as rivals, Ms. Ecclestone said they are best friends who speak on the phone or text message several times a day; the letter "P" in script is tattooed on her wrist for Petra. Ms. Stunt surprised her sister when she called from Los Angeles, where she was vacationing with her then-fiance last spring for Easter, to say she was planning to buy a house there. "When she has something in mind that she wants, she just goes for it," said Ms. Ecclestone. "I'm the same way."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ecclestone is also planning to convert a London pub her father purchased for her into a private home, which she estimates she'll market for roughly $16 million. Ms. Stunt is separately in the midst of renovating a four-story home in London's posh Chelsea neighborhood, which she purchased around the end 2010 for about $90 million. Real estate veterans said it's somewhat unusual for that number of purchases to happen in the same family in such a compressed time frame. "Most high-profile, uber wealthy people prefer to remain under the radar and would shy away from such purchases in bulk," said I. Dolly Lenz, a luxury real-estate agent in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ecclestone now lives about a block from where she and her sister grew up in Chelsea. Her current home, which she plans to sell when her new place is ready, is decorated with photos of the family on ski vacations and at formal events, artwork by Damien Hirst and Anish Kapoor and a sculpture of a Hermes Birkin bag. A bedroom she's converted into a closet is filled with her collection of Ugg boots and Louboutin heels. Wearing Lululemon yoga pants and a fitted hoodie, Ms. Ecclestone sat in her living room, overlooking an outdoor lap pool, and explained that she sees their real estate holdings as smart purchases. "I think London [property] is a really good investment," she said. "There's no bank in the world that can give you that return."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In shopping for real estate, Ms. Eccelstone said she keeps resale value in mind and that a premium location and security are paramount considerations. Her guiding philosophy is to buy "the best property I could find."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After looking at many houses, Ms. Ecclestone said she immediately knew she wanted the home in Kensington Palace Gardens. The estate agent who brokered the deal, Louise Hewlett, said her client understood that the purchase price was "a large sum of money" but that by refurbishing the home, "the value would go up tremendously." She added that her client has already gotten two offers of well-above what she paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim Wright, an estate agent with <span class="companylink">Knight Frank</span> who was not involved in the deal, describes the location as "the most exclusive street in London, bar none." Mr. Wright said with only 30 homes on the block, many of them embassies or ambassadorial residences, renovated properties there tend to sell quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sayed Bukhari, owner of the building, construction and design company that Ms. Stunt retained to work on her Chelsea home, said she's already received several offers in excess of $125 million on it. "When she first bought the house, people were really skeptical about whether it was a good investment," he said. "She has proven everyone completely wrong." Real estate brokers in L.A., however, are less sure Ms. Stunt's purchase there, which included a pricey renovation, will turn out to be such a sound investment. "She would probably need to get a $100 million offer on the home just to break even," said Stephen Shapiro, a top luxury broker. "And there aren't too many buyers looking in that range in L.A. . . . so far, she's the only one." When it comes to selling a property in the $100 million range in L.A., he added, "You are kind of stuck waiting for the next Petra Ecclestone."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing the sisters' newest homes share is Gavin Brodin, a Los Angeles-based designer-builder whose past projects have included homes for Kate Beckinsale and Sylvester Stallone. He met Ms. Ecclestone about a year and a half ago poolside at the resort where they were both vacationing in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, introduced by a mutual friend. Since then, he's been working 15- to 18-hour days to complete both sisters' homes on an accelerated timetable. For her second home in London, however, Ms. Stunt hired design firm Candy &amp; Candy, which caters to Russian oligarchs and celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built in 1991, Ms. Stunt's Los Angeles home sits on five acres in Holmby Hills and has parking for 100 cars. Ms. Stunt's renovation was completed in less than three months with 500 workers. The closet of the master suite -- which at 7,000 square feet has its own kitchen and living room -- is two levels, connected by a pair of staircases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ecclestone, who lives with her private investor boyfriend Omar Khyami and their six dogs, said she plans to move into her house in Kensington in October. Her renovation and expansion of the historic mansion requires about a dozen managers and 80 construction workers on site five days a week. The exclusivity of the gated block means only large construction truck is allowed on the property each day, creating a further challenge for workers, who are also required to be off-site by 5 p.m. every day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designer Mr. Brodin relocated to London to oversee the project last year. "It's nonstop," he said, sitting in a temporary office strewn with planning documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 45-foot-deep hole in the ground will become a 4,000-square-foot, two-story underground addition with a pool with a bar, spa and entertainment center with a nightclub and bowling alley. A multi-room master suite will have separate cocktail and Champagne bars. Mr. Brodin had a staffer travel to Brazil to purchase a giant slab of smoke quartz crystal for the master suite's bathtub. When done, the home will be 20,000 square feet. Everything in it -- from the cutlery to the seats in the 3D movie theater -- will be custom-designed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm definitely, 'Go big or go home,'" Ms. Ecclestone said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The son of a fishing trawler captain who quit school to race motorcycles, Bernie Ecclestone built his fortune from auto sales, property and the transformation of Formula 1 into one of the world's most popular sports. He married Slavica Radic, a Croatian fashion model, in 1985 and said he tried to instill in his daughters a sense of what money was worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ecclestone and his wife divorced in 2009, and he recently became engaged to a 35-year-old Brazilian named Fabiana Flosi. Mr. Ecclestone said he has a close relationship with his daughters but did not advise them on their most recent real estate purchases. With their mother, the sisters are beneficiaries of an off-shore family trust known as Bambino Holdings, of which Mr. Ecclestone said he has no oversight. "I can't control them at all," he said. Along with the trustees, their mother "has been looking after them. And it's right for a mother to do that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ecclestone, whose daughters are often photographed wearing stiletto heels, towering over his 5-foot-3-inch frame, said that by giving them money now, "they will want to be independent and make their own money as they spend it." "I think it's better they make their own mistakes in the world and they'll learn quicker," he said, adding that he's proud of his daughters' real estate investments, made independently from him. He said he did not pay for Ms. Stunt's London home. Public records show that Ms. Stunt borrowed the bulk of the money from her mother -- $82.4 million -- to pay for her $85 million mansion in LA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither sister graduated from university. After attending briefly, Ms. Ecclestone got a job at an Armani retail store, which she quit after six months. "I found it shocking how rude people were," she said. She later worked as a TV host and model and is launching her own line of luxury hair products and lingerie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 19, Ms. Stunt launched a menswear label but folded it quickly thereafter. Earlier this year, she launched a line of high-end clutch purses with names like High Maintenance, Clutch Me and Morning After. Friends describe Ms. Stunt, the younger sister, as the shyer of the two, but more free-spirited. "She's quite airy-fairy and likes to make her mind up last-minute," said Ms. Ecclestone. Ms. Stunt initially agreed to an interview but canceled; her publicist said one of her dogs got sick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sisters attract their share of criticism. In London, construction to renovate Ms. Stunt's Chelsea home, including installing a 25-foot wide aquarium and digging down dozens of feet to create a 10,000-square-foot basement with an indoor pool, squash court, gym, beauty salon and spa, has sparked ire. Terence Bendixson, honorary secretary of planning for the Chelsea Society, a community organization, said Ms. Stunt's London home was turning into "a neo-Georgian pastiche of the kind spec builders put on Bishop's Avenue for people with lots of money and no taste."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Isla Baring, a philanthropist who lives nearby, said the construction is so disruptive that she and several neighbors sent Mr. Ecclestone a letter last month asking for compensation. "We suggested that he give us some money rather than throwing it all away on his spoiled daughter so she can live in this enormous monster of a house," she said. Mr. Ecclestone said he replied to the letter saying that the home was not under his ownership. "They were passionate to get some money any way they could," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year Ms. Ecclestone starred in a reality program about her life called "Billion $$ Girl." One episode depicted her taking her dogs to Harrod's for facials and pedicures. Another shows her debating cancelling a meeting because she woke up with a pimple on her face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her participation in the show, in the midst of a recession, drew criticism from many, including her father. Mr. Ecclestone said he could barely make it through one episode. "I spoke to her before and said . . . 'They're never going to show you in a good light,'" he said. "She was stupid to do it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ecclestone took the criticisms in stride. "It's like water off a duck's back," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said her true passions don't lie in property but in creating a luxury brand and modeling. On a recent afternoon after a pilates class, she climbed into a chauffeured Land Rover and headed to a sushi restaurant. At lunch, she ran into a friend who was dining with the actor Tom Hardy, who plays the villain in the upcoming Batman movie, "Dark Knight Rises."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ecclestone said the attention and speculation doesn't bother her. "I kind of feel like people [in the U.K.] want you to apologize for what you have," she said. "Petra and I are like, 'Why should we have to apologize that our father's this amazing businessman who gave us this great life?'"</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Movie Producer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Megan Ellison, the 26-year-old daughter of Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, spent more than $30 million to buy three homes in the Hollywood Hills over the last few years, one of which she put on the market this spring for $15.5 million.

</div><div class="author">By Eric Morath and Jeffrey Sparshott   </div><div>609 words</div><div>16 May 2012</div><div>11:33</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — U.S. home building was stronger than expected the past two months and industrial output rebounded in April, positive signs that two key sectors of the economy are stabilizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction increased 2.6% in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 717,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That gain came on top of a significant upward revision to March's level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production jumped 1.1% last month, the biggest gain since December 2010, a separate <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> report said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in industrial production alongside housing starts beating expectation shows "that the U.S. economy is, for now at least, shrugging off the euro-zone crisis and the slowdown in China," said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year-over-year, housing starts were up nearly 30%, the Commerce Department data showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast April's housing starts would grow to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 685,000. That would have represented a 4.7% jump from the prior month's previously reported figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">March starts, however, were revised upward to a rate of 699,000 starts from a previously reported rate of 654,000 starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revision brought housing starts in the first quarter of the year to the highest level since the third quarter of 2008, noted Michelle Meyer, senior economist with <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> Merrill Lynch Global Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market continues its slow healing process," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of single-family homes, which made up 69% of housing starts last month, grew 2.3% in April. Multifamily homes with at least two units increased by 3.2% in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improvement came along with other positive signs for the housing market, including stabilization in home prices and a decline in newly delinquent borrowers. But the pace of housing starts is still well below the historical average. Since 1959, builders have started construction on about 1.5 million new homes per year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed report pointed to a strengthening factory sector. In addition to the production gain, capacity utilization rose to 79.2% in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, output fell 0.6% and capacity utilization was 78.4%, according to revised figures. Operating rates are still shy of their long-run average, which is just above 80%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The April report beat expectations. Economists had forecast a 0.6% rise in output and capacity utilization of 79.0%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This report offers a very encouraging glimpse on overall industrial sector activity (and the economic recovery more generally), suggesting that the sector is regaining positive momentum after the temporary weakness of the latter half of Q1," Millian Mulraine, an economist with <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span>, said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing activity increased 0.6% in April. The sector has played a key role in the economic recovery, though it had shown signs of slowing earlier in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent indicators have been positive. On Tuesday, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</span>'s Empire State Manufacturing Survey showed business conditions rebounding in May. Earlier this month, the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index for April rose to its highest level since June 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's Fed report showed broad-based gains across the sector. Production of motor vehicles and parts was up 3.9% on the month and up 27.1% on the year. Production of computers, aerospace equipment, furniture, textiles, apparel and paper all increased.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicoletta Mantovani, the second wife of the late Italian operatic tenor Luciano Pavarotti, has been getting a crash course in New York City real estate of late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mantovani sold two apartments she purchased in New York as investments for less than she paid for them. And she also has hit bumps in attempting to sell one of the units that the famed tenor used to own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September Ms. Mantovani put up for sale one of the three cooperative apartments that the storied opera singer used to own on the 23rd floor of the Hampshire House, at 150 Central Park South. But it's been slow going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mantovani originally put the one-bedroom unit on the block for $1.75 million. That apartment is still for sale, though its price has been reduced to $1.15 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mantovani also has put a second one-bedroom unit on the same floor on the block for the same price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She's keeping a third unit -- also on the 23rd floor -- this one a two-bedroom apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building is known among some opera-buffs because the two surviving members of the so-called Three Tenors -- Placido Domingo and Jose Carrera -- also have lived there over the years, according to Sotheby's agent Robin Rothman, who is handling the sales for Ms. Mantovani.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The offerings of the units come at a time that the city's residential market is continuing to show signs of stability despite economic uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average sales price for co-ops rose to $930 a square foot in the first quarter of this year, up from $896 a square foot in the first quarter of 2011, according to a report by Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Rothman says the apartments Ms. Mantovani is selling need some renovation and don't have Central Park views, which are available in some other units in the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pavarotti had lived in the two=bedroom unit in Hampshire House when he was in the city. He used the other two apartments in the building for staff and guests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Rothman says that one of the late tenor's neighbors told her that "one of the great joys of living there" was opening her door to hear him sing through the hallway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mantovani also hasn't done that well on two apartments she bought by herself as investments in the summer of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that time, she bought a one-bedroom unit at 220 West End Ave. for $993,000 and a studio apartment at 88 Greenwich St. for $606,000, according to public records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, she accepted $925,000 for the one-bedroom unit and $461,500, for the studio, according to records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mantovani was advised to "proceed with the sale to avoid a further decline of the value," her spokesman said. Steven Kopstein, with SKNY Real Estate, was the broker on both sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mantovani inherited assets from Mr. Pavarotti in Europe and New York after he died in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, Ms. Mantovani is working to launch a new American branch of the Luciano Pavarotti Foundation, in memory of the singer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The foundation is making a fundraising push to establish a Pavarotti Garden in Central Park as well as scholarships for opera students, according to Mrs. Mantovani's spokesman.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anne Miller   </div><div>622 words</div><div>10 May 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A20</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A planned four-story apartment building threatens to cast a long shadow -- literally -- over a prominent Park Slope community garden, upsetting area residents who say the new condos would adversely affect the garden's plantings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gardeners using the space hope to block the project but they acknowledge the developer of the new building appears to have the law on his side. City regulations take into account land use and air rights, but not rights to the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It just comes down to the value of the space and the value of the community resources," said Chad Murray, co-president of 6/15 Green, the official name of the community garden at the corner of Sixth Avenue and 15th Street in Brooklyn. "What is more valuable to the community? Another condo building or a green space?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The garden features tulips and peonies, a composting area, a pond and a small solar array that among other things provides power for holiday lights. Parts of the garden, which measures about 12,500 square feet, Mr. Murray said, are planted by committees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 150 families are members, said co-president Traci Strickland. and there is a three-year waiting list for individual plots, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A two-story home on Sixth Avenue abutted the garden until recently, when the property sold. Developer Vlad Maron with the Brooklyn-based IDS Management now plans to construct a four-unit apartment building on the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two upper stories of the planned building next door would block much of the garden's southern exposure, according to Mr. Murray and Ms. Strickland, and the solar array, funded in part by a <span class="companylink">Con Edison</span> grant, would lie in shade. Flowers, some trees and berries also would suffer, they said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home next to the garden has already been torn down, and Mr. Maron said he hopes to start construction in May and finish within a year, although building permits are still needed after initial denials for reasons not related to the garden. The apartments will be two- to three-bedroom units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Maron wouldn't comment on the dispute with the gardeners but said he and his family plan to occupy part of the new building, in part because of the garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My wife wanted to live close to that garden," he said. "That's why we jumped on the possibility. It's a benefit to the community, to the people who live close to it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a spokeswoman with the city Department of Buildings said that permits for the project have been denied due to zoning issues such as lot lines, although she said the developer is expected to resubmit plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Murray said possible lighting solutions have been floated, such as trying to purchase air rights next door, or offering to trade garden land for shifting the building's location. But Mr. Murray said the developer has declined to speak with representatives from 6/15 Green.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gardeners reached out to City Council member Brad Lander's office, but the councilman's communications director, Alex Moore, said there isn't much legal recourse for the community garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Murray admits he is frustrated by the threat to the garden. More than 20 years ago, neighbors turned an abandoned construction site where drug dealers and prostitutes squatted into lush greenery. He said he understands the developer is within his legal rights to build a taller building on the site. But that doesn't make it easier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These things are very necessary, the gardens and the parks," he said. "Now it just seems like . . . growth is more important than what's there."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan is starting to shake off its construction doldrums and could see the first flurry of building activity since the recession, according to the city's Department of Buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan experienced a 169% spike in new building permits issued so far this year, according to the buildings department, which issued 35 permits for construction including hotels, apartment buildings, an "affordable housing" development and an art gallery in the first four months of 2012. That is up from 13 in the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are bullish that big building is coming back to New York City," the buildings commissioner, Robert LiMandri, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan new-building permits issued so far this year are still below 2008 levels, when 42 permits were issued in the first four months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the latest spike in permits reflects developers' growing confidence in certain sectors, especially demand for rental housing and hotels, even while demand for office space lags.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some developers receiving permits this year have been able to get loans already and, in some cases, have already broken ground. They include the Brodsky Organization on a new condo on 79th Street and Barone Management on two Gene Kaufman-designed hotels in Hudson Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It certainly seems like there's more cranes in the air today. I actually know the answer and there are," Mr. LiMandri said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the latest activity is concentrated in the Hudson Yards area and Harlem -- two areas that were poised for change during the previous boom but were also hit hard when the economy collapsed in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In four or five months, you're going to see [neighborhoods] taking shape," Mr. LiMandri said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six building permits were issued on the far West Side in the 20s and 30s, as developers look to take advantage of the opening of the second phase of High Line elevated park, the extension of the No. 7 subway line and the planned office development by Related Cos. on the former rail yards west of 10th Avenue between 30th and 33rd streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related has committed to start the first building on the Hudson Yards with <span class="companylink">Coach Inc</span>. as its anchor tenant later this year. But the developer has already received a permit this year for its roughly 378,000-square-foot residential project nearby at 500 W. 30th St.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flurry of new development permits comes at a time of economic uncertainty, caused by turmoil in Europe, the coming U.S. elections and layoffs in the financial-services industry. But developers say they're moving forward anyway because a lack of new construction has created significant pent-up demand for housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We feel that the market is very good right now and ripe for new condominium projects," said Michael Namer, chief executive of Alfa Development. "We do know that there's a spike [in development], but it's a spike from zero."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alfa has broken ground on a 51-unit condo project on 21st Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues, where it plans to launch sales May 17.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales have been strong at a handful of new condos in the area, including the Brodsky Organization's project at 422 W. 20th St. and a new condo building by Anbau Enterprises on 23rd Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both real-estate and construction industry associations say their members are busier these days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a dramatic increase from what has occurred over the last year or two," said Louis Coletti, president of the Building Trades Employers' Association. But, in a reversal, he said, "The private sector is beginning to get out of the doldrums, at a time when city and state agencies don't have enough money."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Slattery, a senior vice president at the Real Estate Board of New York, a real-estate industry association and lobbying group, said its data also show that permits for new residential units doubled in the first three months of 2012 compared with the year-earlier period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is pickup in the market on the housing side. There's been so little production that demand is starting to press people to build again," Mr. Slattery said, while also cautioning it remains well below 2006 and 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, experts say there is little chance of nearing boom-time construction levels because banks are unwilling to give large loans on new projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, Mr. LiMandri said he is confident construction activity is on the upswing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan, demolition permits issued by his department -- an earlier indicator of precursor of new development than building permits -- are also up significantly in the first four months this year: to 74 from a five-year low of 35 in 2010.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan   </div><div>776 words</div><div>3 May 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of vacation homes are picking up as low prices pull buyers off the fence. But with travel costs rising and consumers still uncertain about the economy, many buyers are snapping up properties closer to home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a change from the past decade when people often headed out of state to buy vacation homes near resorts and areas that were tourist destinations, including Orlando near Florida's <span class="companylink">Walt Disney</span> World and the gambling Mecca of Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these days, many vacation-home buyers are turning back the clock and looking for properties in the more traditional -- and less glitzy -- vacation-home communities near where they live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jed Kolko, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia Inc</span>., a real-estate information website, said that increasingly "people choose second homes that are a shorter drive rather than a plane flight away."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> found that the median distance between a buyer's primary residence and his vacation home declined 19% to 305 miles in 2011 from 2010. It was the first decline since the group began keeping data in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, vacation-home sales also are picking up in parts of Florida, Nevada and other states that have long catered to vacationers, although real-estate agents say more of those buyers tend to be from nearby states and fewer are from far away. And plenty of retirees still want to vacation in climates that are warm year-round.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift in buying habits partly reflects the changing portrait of the typical vacation-home buyer. In the recent past, the vacation-home market was led by families looking for places with attractions for children as well as adults. But a growing number of buyers are older and seeking vacation homes that transition into retirement homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People want to stay within driving distance because they're more able to maintain the homes, they have better networks in place and friends and family nearby to use and sustain the homes," said Jon Gray, vice president of HomeAway.com, a website that lists vacation rentals. A survey in March by site operator <span class="companylink">HomeAway Inc</span>. found that the most popular markets among vacationers this year are those that can be reached in a drive of four hours or less from home. That makes those markets good investment opportunities for the 91% of vacation-home buyers who plan to rent their properties when they aren't using them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's vacation-home buyers also are less affluent than in past years and more cost-sensitive. According to the NAR study, the average annual income of vacation-home buyers declined to $88,600 in 2011 from $99,500 in 2010. "If you have more typical vacation buyers coming into the marketplace, they're looking at the whole package, including the expense of getting there, as well," says Stan Humphries, chief economist with real-estate information company <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the values of vacation homes continue to fall, with the median sales price declining 19%, to $121,300 between 2010 and 2011, according toNAR. The trend is benefiting vacation communities near cities, including beach towns in the Northeast, from Massachusetts to the Carolinas, as well as lakefront enclaves in the Midwest and desert locales in California such as the Coachella Valley, according to real-estate agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vickie Leese, a 53-year-old financial adviser in Westminster, Md., closed in April on a two-bedroom home in an Ocean City, Md., condominium complex that has a swimming pool and is three blocks from the beach. Over the past year and a half, Ms. Leese visited and considered buying homes in a number of places, including Fort Myers, Fla., and Myrtle Beach, S.C. But in the end, she decided to stay in Maryland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Florida would require a flight or a 24-hour drive for me, and the Carolinas are eight hours away," Ms. Leese said. "Even though the real estate in Ocean City is more expensive, in a way it's more affordable. Even with gas prices skyrocketing, it made more economic sense to buy there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rising cost of gas and airfares is a huge factor for many buyers. The average cost of a gallon of gasoline was $3.83 this week. Gas prices have been rising steadily since mid-December. Airfares, meanwhile, jumped 14% between March 2010 and March 2011, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly six years after home prices started falling, more U.S. markets appear to be nearing a new phase: a prolonged bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hitting a bottom, of course, isn't the same as a full-fledged recovery, which is still years off for many housing markets -- as well as for millions of people who purchased homes or took cash out during the bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is that housing construction and home sales appear to have hit a floor. Home builders cut back heavily in the past four years and began construction on just 434,000 single-family homes last year, the lowest level on record. Research firm Zelman &amp; Associates estimates builders will start construction on 540,000 homes this year, a 24% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales during the first quarter posted double-digit gains from the previous-year period. A rebound here is likely simply because "we've starved the market for new-home construction," said Ivy Zelman, the firm's chief executive. Sales of previously owned homes, meanwhile, are up 32% from their low point of mid-2010, when sales plunged following the expiration of home-buyer tax credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That leaves prices as the last measure that hasn't yet stopped falling. But there are signs of progress on that front, too, as the pace of declines is slowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, home prices fell by 2% from their level of a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span>., a real-estate-data firm. But after excluding foreclosures and other distressed sales, prices were down by just 0.8%, the smallest year-over-year decline since May 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you remove the distress, you're looking at housing prices not falling much further," said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel Inc., a New York-based appraisal firm. The problem is that foreclosures are still a very high share of sales in many of the hardest-hit markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest headwinds today is the "shadow inventory" of potential foreclosures. Banks owned about 450,000 properties at the end of March, but there were an additional two million loans in some stage of foreclosure and about 1.7 million more where mortgage payments hadn't been made in more than 90 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing economists are debating whether that shadow inventory will spoil any housing recovery. "That'll be like a ball and chain," said Mark Fleming, chief economist at <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>. "It won't prevent a recovery, but it could drag it out over several years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is getting a lift from reduced supply and stronger demand. Mortgage-interest rates at near-record lows and prices at their 2002 levels have made homes more affordable than at any point in the past decade. The number of homes for sale has fallen over the past year. A top complaint of some real-estate agents today is that there aren't enough homes to show potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Zelman, who was among the first to warn that the air had begun seeping out of the housing bubble six years ago, said the shadow inventory is "not going to result in the double dip that people always talk about." She points to a burgeoning appetite for housing from investors, who are scooping up homes that can be converted to rentals, and six years of pent-up demand from traditional buyers who feel better about their financial prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the foreclosure overhang is serious, some economists say there is a less-noticed tailwind that could balance things out: the sharp decline in new construction over the past four years. "A lot of the people who talk about 'shadow inventory' don't talk about how slow the overall housing stock has been growing," said Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's more that will keep home prices from rising, once they do hit bottom. First, many Americans don't have the required down payment or can't qualify for a mortgage. Banks are making borrowers jump through more hoops in order to produce loans that can't be subjected to a costly "buyback" demand from <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> or other investors if the loan defaults. That is keeping credit very tight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than one-third of all homeowners have less than 25% equity, including 15% that are underwater, meaning their homes are worth less than what they owe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, inventory declines may be less of a sign of health than they would suggest and instead reflect one of the structural problems holding back housing: Sellers are frozen, either unwilling or unable to sell at current values. Markets above the entry level, where demand from investors and first-time buyers isn't as strong, face a particularly steep climb because of that equity hole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nobody's voluntarily putting their home up for sale," said John Burns, a home-builder consultant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For-sale inventories may also be lean because banks decelerated the foreclosure process over the past 18 months after courts found that they were routinely passing off forged paperwork to take back homes. If prices are stabilizing because of that temporary drop in foreclosures, some recent gains will prove artificial. Ultimately, because that shadow inventory is concentrated in certain markets, price drops also will be concentrated there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets that are more quickly absorbing the stock of foreclosures amid an improving economy, such as Phoenix, and in those where the overhang wasn't as severe, such as Denver and Washington, D.C., have probably hit bottom. Others face a longer haul, especially in overbuilt cities such as Atlanta and Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many cities in Florida and the Northeast, where banks have been unable to satisfy court-administered foreclosure processes, have a glut of foreclosures that has yet to be digested. There is plenty that can still go wrong, like a sudden rise in mortgage rates or slowdown in job growth, and a lot that needs to go right for housing to recover. But there are more signs than a year ago that housing isn't worsening and may be improving.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S construction spending up by 0.1% in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $808.07 billion</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending by state and local governments down to lowest level since November 2006</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private sector spending up by 0.7% in March</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sharp drop in construction outlays by state and local governments caused overall spending for the sector to stay nearly flat in March even as home building rebounded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall construction spending increased by 0.1% in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $808.07 billion, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a 0.5% gain for March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report shows "a widening split between housing...and public construction," said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist for <span class="companylink">High Frequency Economics Ltd</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State and local governments decreased construction outlays by 1.6% to $247.31 billion. That is the lowest since November 2006 and the fourth straight monthly drop for the category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Municipalities, under pressure to reduce spending as tax receipts remain depressed and aid from Washington slows, spent less on highways, education and health care during the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shepherdson cautioned that municipal spending tends to come in waves, so the slow start to the year may not necessarily continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total public construction fell by 1.1% as Federal spending rose 3.8% to $28.85 billion in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in local government spending helped offset gains in the private sector, which showed a solid level of growth after a decline the prior month. Total spending in February was revised down to a 1.4% loss from an originally reported 1.1% decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And overall residential construction increased by 0.7% to $251.21 billion in March. Private residential spending grew at the same rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private nonresidential construction--including office, commercial and infrastructure building--grew by 0.7% to $287.80 billion in March after posting a decline in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Construction spending appears to be slowly climbing, emphasis on slowly, out of a very deep hole," said Steven A. Wood, chief economist at Insight Economics LLC. Still the level remains 33.4% below its March 2006 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relatively weak spending on nonresidential structures was a key factor holding back overall economic growth during the first three months of the year, the government said last week in its initial measure of gross domestic product.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown </div><div>738 words</div><div>30 April 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A20</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pressure is rising in a standoff on Central Park South between two of the city's most powerful developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span> is getting ready to start demolition on a 1950s-era apartment building at 220 Central Park South to get the site prepared most likely for a luxury condominium tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's only one problem: One of the commercial tenants in 220 Central Park South hasn't left. That tenant, a parking garage, is controlled by rival developer Gary Barnett.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barnett's Extell Development Co., which is developing the soaring 1,004-foot One57 condominium tower one block to the east, bought into the lease of the underground parking garage in Vornado's building a few years ago, according to people familiar with the matter. It runs about five more years, the people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus far Mr. Barnett has resisted Vornado's attempts to rid him from the building through a buyout or settlement. But now Vornado is stepping up the pressure as it moves forward with demolition preparations, which call for tearing down the building above the garage, stopping at the second floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talks between the two sides also are continuing. "We're trying to take down the building and then we'll come up with a first-class building," Vornado's chief executive, Michael Fascitelli, said in a brief interview last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As to Mr. Barnett, he said, "We have a little issue there, but we're trying to resolve it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extell, however, believes tearing down the building atop the garage could be dangerous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think it would show very poor judgment to attempt to demolish an occupied building, especially when there is no possibility of construction for a number of years. God forbid something bad happens for no purpose," a spokeswoman said in a statement. "We have the greatest respect for the leadership of Vornado and would be surprised if they actually moved to demolish."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vornado, one of the city's largest office and retail landlords, filed with the city for demolition permits last month. Scaffolding is going up on the edges of the white-brick building, which was cleared of residential tenants in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should the two sides fail to strike a deal, Vornado could still proceed with demolition. But demolition would likely be more complex and expensive if the garage isn't vacated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's unclear exactly what Mr. Barnett wants. Extell owns a neighboring site on 58th Street that was purchased 2006, where it has filed plans for an 18-story tower. Depending what Vornado builds on its site, many Central Park views in Mr. Barnett's planned tower could be blocked. Vornado also owns the site directly to the west of Mr. Barnett's property on 58th Street, which could factor into discussions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fascitelli said last week he believes Mr. Barnett, who he described as "tough" and "smart," wants to be paid some money, and for Vornado "to do something different that enhances his building."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vornado bought 220 Central Park South in 2005 for $132 million, initially planning to put in its place a 41-story condominium tower. The company hasn't released updated plans but chairman Steven Roth made it clear in his annual letter to shareholders earlier this month that Vornado has been watching what Mr. Barnett is doing at One57.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We hear that the 1,000 foot tall, direct park-view apartment tower under construction on 57th Street is pricing at $6,500 per square foot," Mr. Roth wrote. "Our 220 Central Park South site, just down the block, is better."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vornado has a record of patience in the New York City development world, as the bulk of its activity is in owning existing buildings. The company sat for years on the vacant site of the former Alexander's department store on Lexington Avenue and 59th Street before building <span class="companylink">Bloomberg LP</span>'s new headquarters, which was crowned with floors of high-priced condominiums with Central Park views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, Mr. Barnett, a former diamond trader-turned developer, is building constantly. Skilled at assembling prime development sites through buying up neighboring lots, he launched projects both in the boom years of the last cycle, as well in the uncertain early days of the recovery, when he bet on a rebound and started work on two large Manhattan towers.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>1406 words</div><div>27 April 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new development is catching home buyers off guard as the spring sales season gets under way: Bidding wars are back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From California to Florida, many buyers are increasingly competing for the same house. Unlike the bidding wars that typified the go-go years and largely reflected surging sales, today's are a result of supply shortages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a little surprising because we thought bidding wars were done with," said Andy Aley, who is looking to buy his first home in Seattle's Beacon Hill neighborhood. The 31-year-old attorney was outbid this year when he offered up to $23,000 above the $357,000 listing price and agreed to waive inspections and other closing conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competitive bidding in the current environment isn't producing huge price increases or leaving sellers with hefty profits, as occurred during the housing boom. Still, the bidding wars caused by tight inventory provide the latest evidence that housing demand is starting to pick up after a six-year-long slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index that measures the number of contracts signed to purchase previously owned homes rose in March to its highest level in nearly two years, up 12.8% from a year ago and 4.1% from February, the National Association of Realtors reported on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We very much believe we've hit bottom," said Ivy Zelman, chief executive of a research firm, who was among the first to warn of a downturn seven years ago. Earlier this week, she raised her home-price forecast for the year, calling for a 1% annual gain, up from a 1% decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal's quarterly survey found that the inventory of homes listed for sale declined sharply in all 28 markets tracked. Real-estate agents consider a market balanced when there is a six-month supply of homes for sale. At the height of the housing crisis, in 2008, there was an 11.1-months' supply. In March, there was a 6.3-months' supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory levels in many markets were at the lowest level in years. At the current pace of sales, it would take just 1.5 months to sell all the homes listed in Sacramento, Calif., and 2.4 months to sell all the homes listed in Phoenix. San Francisco and Washington, D.C., each have 3.4 months of supply, while Miami has 4.1 months of supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other markets have plenty of homes. Chicago, for example, has 9.4 months of supply, while New York's Long Island has 16.1 months of supply. Even in those markets, the number of houses for sale is edging down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increased competition is frustrating buyers and their agents. "We're writing a record number of offers, but we're not seeing a record number of closings and that's because it's so competitive," said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of real-estate brokerage <span class="companylink">Redfin Corp</span>. in Seattle with offices in 14 states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 83% of offers that Redfin agents have made on behalf of clients in the San Francisco Bay area this year and 71% in Southern California have had competing bids. Redfin represented a buyer that made the winning bid on a Gaithersburg, Md., home earlier this month after agreeing to adopt the dog of the seller, who was relocating and looking to find a new home for "Buddy," a white toy poodle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories are declining for a number of reasons. Some sellers, unwilling to accept prices that are still down from their peak by one-third, are taking their homes off the market in anticipation of higher prices down the road. Meanwhile, investors have been outmaneuvering consumers for the best properties, often making cash offers that are quickly accepted by sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, some economists say that inventory levels are being held artificially low because <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and the nation's biggest banks have been slow to list for sale hundreds of thousands of foreclosed homes they currently own. The lenders slowed down foreclosure sales and repossessions after record-keeping abuses surfaced 18 months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks and other mortgage investors owned nearly 450,000 foreclosed properties at the end of March, and another two million mortgages were in some stage of foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories could rise, putting more pressure on prices, if the banks and other lenders step up their efforts to sell their properties. Real-estate agents say they aren't concerned. "There's an enormous appetite for foreclosures. Release the inventory. It will sell," said Richard Smith, chief executive of Realogy Corp., which owns the Coldwell Banker and Century 21 real-estate brands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The declining inventory of older homes is spurring sales of new homes. New home sales are up 16% so far this year, compared with a year ago, while inventories of new homes fell in March to their lowest level since record keeping began in 1963.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>., a builder based in Scottsdale, Ariz., reported Thursday a 36% increase in orders for the quarter ending in March versus the previous-year period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though bidding wars are pushing prices higher, many homes are still selling for prices far lower than a few years ago. Increased demand is "entirely affordability driven, which tells me there will be strong resistance to price increases" by buyers, says Jeffrey Otteau, president of Otteau Valuation Group, an East Brunswick, N.J., appraisal firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents are rising at a time when mortgage rates have fallen to very low levels. The result is that the monthly mortgage payment on a median-priced home is lower than any time since the 1990s. <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> reported on Thursday that mortgage rates fell to 3.88% for the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage, near its lowest recorded level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates are "so low that we can afford a house that was out of our price range before," said Aarthi Srinivasan, who is looking with her husband for a home around Palo Alto, Calif., one of the country's hottest real-estate markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Srinivasan says she fears that prices are being bid up too quickly. She says she had her "aha moment" earlier this year while touring a 50-year-old house that needed extensive remodeling. The home, listed at $1.1 million, received nearly 10 offers and eventually went under contract for more than $1.3 million to a buyer who hadn't even viewed the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are only so many buyers who are going to be in such a hurry, so we're hoping it'll top off soon," she says. On Monday, they offered to pay more than the $1.2 million list price for a four-bedroom, bank-owned foreclosure. They haven't found out if they made the top bid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other side of those transactions are sellers like Debbie and Bill Wetherell, who had 17 offers in four days for their four-bedroom home in Danville, Calif. "I was floored. It was so fast, it was surreal," says Ms. Wetherell. The home sold on Wednesday for $796,000, more than $50,000 above the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the sale is for nearly $180,000 less than what they paid for the house in 2005. Ms. Wetherell's husband has commuted to Reno, Nev., for five years and they have decided to relocate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing markets face other headwinds. More than 11 million homeowners owe more than their home is worth. It is a big reason that the "trade-up" market has been stalled. These homeowners can't sell their current homes, let alone come up with the down payment for their next home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage-lending standards remain tough. Real-estate agents say an unusually high share of deals are falling apart because homes won't appraise at the price that buyers have agreed to pay sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, borrowers with stable jobs are looking to make deals. Kelly Pajela-Fu and her husband offered to pay the asking price of $600,000 for a four-bedroom home in Marblehead, Mass., within a day of the property hitting the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We just knew this house would go quickly," says Ms. Pajela-Fu, a 31-year-old doctor who had lost out on an earlier offer. Their strategy to avoid a bidding war paid off: The sellers accepted their offer before having an open house.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Key stock benchmarks rose as strong results from a trio of blue-chip companies helped counter mixed readings from the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 98 points, or 0.8%, to 13026 in midday Tuesday trading, undoing almost all of Monday's 102-point decline. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index advanced six points, or 0.5%, to 1373, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell less than one point, or 0.1%, to 2969, pulled down by Apple ahead of its closely watched quarterly results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Telecommunications stocks led the market higher. <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span> rose 4% after the telecom giant said first-quarter earnings rose 5.2% as fewer people canceled services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">3M</span> rallied 1.8% after the blue-chip conglomerate reported first-quarter earnings that topped forecasts, as higher profit from automotive supplies and other industrial products made up for weakness in consumer electronics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">United Technologies</span> gained 0.4% after the conglomerate said first-quarter results were helped by an unexpected upturn in North American residential air-conditioning sales last month, a sign of life in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think as long as nothing surprising unfolds in Europe . . . the focus will be Apple's earnings after the close," said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz &amp; Associates." Apple fell 2.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes in the U.S. slipped in March, but not as much as expected. February sales were revised up to show the best reading since November 2009. Meanwhile, home prices continued to fall, pushing <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller home-price indexes to new post-crisis lows in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other corporate news, <span class="companylink">International Business Machines</span> rose 1.15% after its board approved a 13% increase in the stock's quarterly dividend and authorized an additional $7 billion to buy back shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European Stocks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European stock markets rebounded Tuesday, boosted by gains in bank and auto shares, as relatively well-received government-debt auctions helped improve sentiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benchmark Stoxx 600 index closed up 1% at 254.37, London's FTSE 100 gained 0.8% to 5709.49, Frankfurt's DAX rose 1% to 6590.41, and Paris's CAC-40 jumped 2.3% to 3169.32.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gains came after markets had fallen sharply Monday on weak manufacturing data in the region and political concerns in France and the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stock sectors that weakened substantially Monday were the best performers. Autos and bank stocks jumped, with the Stoxx 600 index for each ending up 2.1% and 2.0% respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Paris, <span class="companylink">Societe Generale</span> gained 3.3%, <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> rose 3%, and <span class="companylink">Credit Agricole</span> advanced 2.3%. In Frankfurt, <span class="companylink">Volkswagen</span> gained 2.6% and Daimler added 2%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- A sale of two-year notes by the U.S. Treasury went off with little fanfare Tuesday, as has been the case in recent months for the maturity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for the $35 billion auction was fair, so there was little reaction in the bond market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bid-to-cover ratio was 3.76, the highest since November, but the indirect bid, a proxy of foreign demand, was 32.1%, compared with a 34.4% average of the past six sales. The direct bid skidded to 7.8%, versus the 12.2% average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The notes were sold at 0.27%, the lowest yield since January. The auction kicked off this week's $99 billion wave of supply, which tends to be a drag on prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury prices were lower throughout the morning after a flurry of data showed slow-but-steady progress in the country's economic recovery. The 10-year note was down 7/32 to yield 1.966% in midday trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dutch government attracted decent demand at it two- and 25-year bond auctions, despite its weekend collapse over budget-cut disagreements. Bond offerings out of Spain and Italy hit the market without a hitch, each selling at or near the maximum planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports in the U.S. showed that while improvements in the U.S. housing market remain choppy, they are reflective of an industry that is on the mend. Sales of new homes fell more than 7% in March from the month before, but a separate report from the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> showed home prices posting their first year-on-year gain since 2007. There was also a jump in manufacturing activity in the Richmond, Va., region this month and consumer confidence edged down.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A host of housing indicators offered mixed signals about the weak U.S. real-estate market Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales in March fell from their February level, the Commerce Department said. Home prices hit a new low in February and were 3.5% below their year-earlier level, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index, which tracks home prices in 20 cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But beneath those lackluster numbers there were signs that housing could be improving slowly. The 3.5% annual decline in the Case-Shiller index was an improvement from a corresponding 3.9% year-over-year drop recorded in January or the 4.1% drop in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After adjusting for seasonal factors -- to take into account the slower winter selling season -- home prices in February actually were up from January by 0.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, sales of newly built homes in March were above last year's level by 7.5% at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 328,000. The number would have been up from February's level had officials not revised up that month's tally by 13%, to 353,000 from 313,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sales are improving at a snail's pace from near-record lows," wrote economist Patrick Newport at IHS Global Insight. Median sales prices were up by 6.3% from one year ago and the number of new homes listed for sale fell to 144,000, the lowest level on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, an index from the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> showed that home prices in February turned positive from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 0.4% gain in home prices represents the first increase the index has measured since July 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The divergence between the two indices stems from how they measure home prices. It shows how the prices of foreclosed properties and other distressed sales are falling, even as prices for nondistressed homes stabilize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The dichotomy between distressed and nondistressed is becoming sharper," said Stephen East, a home-building analyst at ISI Group LLC, in a research note. "Distressed pricing will continue declining, while nondistressed remains flattish to up in some areas."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the FHFA index looks only at mortgages backed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, it contains fewer foreclosed properties, which were more often financed by riskier subprime mortgages those companies didn't buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FHFA's index also has a larger sample size. It collects data from every state, while Case-Shiller looks at just 20 cities. And because Case-Shiller is value-weighted, it may more heavily reflect home-price movements in expensive cities.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many parts of the U.S., prices of raw land, which typically has no roads or sewers, intended for housing have barely recovered from the depths of the downturn. Some of the land in remote areas even is being returned to agricultural use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the Houston area, which is enjoying strong job growth thanks to the energy sector, <span class="companylink">Weyerhaeuser Co</span>. just made a profit on the sale of 3,200 acres of mostly raw land to a venture led by <span class="companylink">Tricon Capital Group Inc</span>. for $125 million. A Weyerhaeuser spokesman confirmed the profit but declined to say how much it was. Weyerhaeuser paid about $56 million for the land in 2005, according to people familiar with the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the Cross Creek Ranch master-planned community, which the land is part of, has seen continued signs of progress throughout the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 250 homes sold last year, up from 189 in 2011 and 161 in 2010. Homes have sold at an average price of about $330,000 since 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a market-rate sale," said David Jarvis, Houston director of Metrostudy, a housing-research firm. "That's what you're seeing in Houston."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Houston recorded 18,366 housing starts, the most of any U.S. market followed by Metrostudy but still way below its peak of 48,000 starts in 2006. Demand for new homes in the Houston area is strengthening, and more than 20,000 new-home starts are expected this year, according to Metrostudy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for Texas land owes some of its strength to the population that has jumped 26%, to 5.9 million, in 2010 since 2000. In Houston, housing demand also has been fueled by the growth in the energy sector, where more than 16,000 energy and energy-related jobs were added in the 12 months ending in March, according to the Greater Houston Partnership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cross Creek Ranch is located in Fulshear, about 30 miles west of downtown Houston, and near to such employers as <span class="companylink">BP PLC</span> and <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span>. Much of a main roadway from Houston to Fulshear recently was widened, shortening travel time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Folks [from Houston] used to make a day out of coming out and getting barbecue," said C.J. Snipes, Fulshear's administrator. On a good day, it now takes about 35 minutes to get to downtown Houston, Mr. Snipes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since its 2005 purchase, Weyerhaeuser has invested millions more to improve parts of it, adding roads, a sewer system, thousands of trees and amenities like a water park and gym.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since it opened in 2008, about 600 homes have been sold by Weyerhaeuser and others that purchased lots from the company. Tricon Capital, a Canadian real-estate-investment firm, plans to sell an additional 300 lots this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other parts of the country, results haven't been quite so rosy for Weyerhaeuser, a forest-products company as well as a large home builder. The number of single-family homes it sold dropped to 1,902 last year from a peak of 4,152 in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, Weyerhaeuser's shares closed at $20.52, up 50 cents, or 2.5%, in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading. That is up from the 52-week low of $14.82, but still below the $80 range they were trading at in 2007. The company has warned Wall Street that it would have a loss from its single-family home-building operations in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weyerhaeuser's sale of the Cross Creek land comes as home builders generally have been backing away from the practice of banking land for future projects. Instead, they have been opting to buy land when needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will Holder, president of Weyerhaeuser's Trendmaker Homes subsidiary, which developed Cross Creek, said selling the land to Tricon gives the company more flexibility to invest in other areas of Houston. Weyerhaeuser's deal with Tricon allows it to keep buying lots at Cross Creek, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weyerhaeuser's strategy makes particular sense in a state like Texas, where it is relatively easy to get entitlements to build on land. It makes less sense to hold such large tracts, said Paul C. Quinn, an analyst with <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span>.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fresh economic benchmarks painted a mixed picture of the nation's housing market, reflecting a sector that is inching forward amid fits and starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most closely watched indicator Tuesday was the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index, which tracks home prices in 20 cities. The index hit a new low in February, falling 3.5% below its year-earlier mark to a level not seen since late 2002. But the decline represented an improvement from a corresponding 3.9% year-over-year drop recorded in January or the 4.1% drop in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After adjusting for seasonal factors—to take into account the slower winter selling season—the Case-Shiller index showed that home prices in February were actually up from January by 0.2%. And prices are rising in a larger number of metropolitan areas. The Case-Shiller index showed that five cities—Phoenix, Miami, Minneapolis, Denver and Detroit—saw home prices above year-earlier levels in February. In nine others, including Atlanta, Chicago, Las Vegas and Seattle, prices fell to new lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly new-home sales report also was better than it appeared on the surface. Overall, sales fell in March from February, but ran ahead of last year's pace by 7.5%, according to the Commerce Department. The decline in March was less disappointing than it initially appeared because of a sharp upward revision to February's sales tally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's all a matter of perspective. The first quarter was materially better than last year, but it remains very weak by historical standards," said Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist in Leesburg, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales figures for January and December also were revised up, pushing new-home sales during the first quarter to 17% above the same period last year. The median price of a new home jumped 6.3% in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, an index from the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> showed that home prices in February turned positive from one year ago. The 0.4% gain in home prices represents the first increase the index has measured since July 2007. The FHFA index, which looks only at mortgages backed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, contains fewer foreclosed properties than the Case-Shiller index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you're looking at year-over-year numbers, it shows a clearer trend that we're doing much better than we were last year," said Stan Humphries, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>. The real-estate firm is set to release its own index Wednesday showing that home prices in March posted their largest monthly increase since 2006, before the housing market peaked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rest of the year is shaping up to be "a good year for sales, even though prices for a lot of these markets are going to float a little bit lower," said Mr. Humphries. He expects prices to rise by 6.5% in Phoenix over the next year, and by 5.6% in Miami, which have both seen a surge of investor-driven purchases after values fell by more than half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in Atlanta, where prices are down by 8.7% over the past year, Mr. Humphries estimates prices will fall by another 4.1% over the next year. Chicago, which has seen a 9.7% decline over the past year, is looking at another 3.8% drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists aren't predicting that home prices will rise much, if at all, on a national basis this year because a large "shadow" supply of potential foreclosures has yet to work through the market. Even if prices do rise, it will be years before many borrowers who owe more than their homes are worth will have equity in their homes again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign that the still-slow economic recovery is wearing on consumer psyches, the Conference Board said Tuesday that its Consumer Confidence Index fell slightly in April, the second consecutive month of decline, and remains at recessionary levels. Consumers were feeling more upbeat about the job market, but continue tofeel uneasy about the state of the finances and the economy's overall direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're still in a slow period.... We're still in a funk," said Robert Shiller, the Yale University economist who co-founded the index that bears his name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tough credit standards and negative sentiment about homeownership also stand in the way of a full-fledged housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But housing demand has risen modestly from a year ago, lifted by low mortgage rates and an improving jobs market. "It certainly is a reasonable thing, if you want to own a home, to buy right now," Mr. Shiller said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong quarterly results from a handful of blue chips pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average higher, but weakness in Apple's shares helped send the Nasdaq lower for the fifth day in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow industrials gained 74.39 points, or 0.6%, to 13001.56 Tuesday, and the Standard Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.03 points, or 0.4%, to 1371.97.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Telecommunications-sector stocks led the S&amp;P 500 higher. <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span> rose $1.11, or 3.6%, to $31.72, after the company said first-quarter earnings increased 5.2% as fewer people canceled services, though revenue grew more slowly than expected. <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications</span> tacked on 93 cents, or 2.4%, to 39.50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of 3M rose $1.36, or 1.6%, to $88.49, after the blue-chip conglomerate reported first-quarter earnings that topped forecasts on higher profit from automotive supplies and other industrial products made up for continuing weakness in consumer electronics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">United Technologies</span> inched up 10 cents, or 0.1%, to 79.85, after the conglomerate said first-quarter results were helped by an unexpected upturn in North American residential air-conditioning sales last month, a sign of life in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It just seems as though we're going back and forth between concerns in Europe--and maybe at the margin some softer economic data--and earnings that have clearly been better than consensus estimates," said Hank Smith, chief investment officer at IG Markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technology stocks were firmly in the red on Tuesday. The Nasdaq fell 8.85 points, or 0.3%, to 2961.60, reversing early gains to finish lower for the fifth consecutive session, its longest losing streak since November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apple fell 11.42, or 2%, to 560.28, the stock's 10th drop in 11 sessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But shares jumped 7% in after-hours trading after the electronics giant reported that its fiscal second-quarter profit nearly doubled, boosted by robust sales of iPhones and iPads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Netflix slumped 14.16, or 14%, to 87.68, after the online movie-rental company projected disappointing subscriber growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes in the U.S. slipped in March, but not as much as expected, and February sales were raised to show the best reading since November 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, home prices continued to fall in February, pushing Standard Poor's Case-Shiller home-price indexes to new postcrisis lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, consumers turned slightly more pessimistic in April, as rising gas prices and weaker job growth appeared to take a toll on confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European markets were mostly higher after decent government-debt auctions in the Netherlands, Spain and Italy, recently focal points of investor worries. The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Asia, Japan's Nikkei Stock Average lost 0.8%, losing ground for the fourth session in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude-oil futures edged up 0.4% to $103.55 a barrel, while gold futures tacked on 0.7% to $1643.00 a troy ounce. The U.S. dollar slipped against the euro but rose slightly against the yen. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds rose to 1.963%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other corporate news, <span class="companylink">International Business Machines</span> rose 1.38, or 0.7%, 200.00 after the company's board approved a 13% increase in the stock's quarterly dividend and authorized an additional $7 billion to buy back shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Big Lots</span> plunged 11.00, or 24%, to 34.71, after the closeout retailer said it expects fiscal first-quarter same-store sales to be down slightly from year-earlier levels, compared with a previous forecast for a rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">RadioShack</span> slid 63 cents, or 11%, to 5.34, after the consumer-electronics retailer reported a surprise first-quarter loss and revenue that also fell short of expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Kansas City Southern</span> rose 4.23, or 6%, to 75.09, after the regional railroad operator's first-quarter earnings climbed 17% as revenue improved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Baker Hughes</span> rose 1.97, or 4.8%, to 43.04 after revenue exceeded expectations, though challenges in its North American pressure pumping business tamped down margins.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ben Casselman and Nick Timiraos   </div><div>1043 words</div><div>20 April 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising layoffs, falling home sales and slowing manufacturing activity are sparking fears that the economic recovery is headed for a springtime stall for the third year in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New data Thursday provided fresh evidence that the job market is losing the momentum it built earlier this year, which could pressure fragile housing markets that have been showing signs of life. Separate reports this week suggested that the factory sector, a source of strength in the recovery, now is being hurt by weak growth overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, recent signals have been mixed, with worrisome indicators following positive ones -- such as consumer confidence and auto sales -- that suggest the recovery remains on track. Economists generally believe total economic output in the first three months of the year grew at a rate a bit above 2%-- slower than at the end of 2011 but significantly stronger than the same period a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's been the weakest recovery in the post-World War II period, and that hasn't changed," said David Rosenberg, chief economist for investment firm Gluskin Sheff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New claims for unemployment benefits ticked down last week to 386,000 from 388,000 the week before, the Labor Department said Thursday. But those figures have been repeatedly raised in recent weeks, suggesting that the final number could be higher -- and well above the 361,000 notched in mid-February. The less-volatile four-week average rose for the fifth time in seven weeks, a sign that layoffs are increasing again after approaching a four-year low earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists cautioned that a range of factors, from a historically warm winter to an early Easter, have muddied the weekly figures and made it difficult to identify clear trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, the recent figures, combined with an unexpectedly weak March jobs report, suggest the job market is cooling. "It adds to concern about backsliding in job creation after faster employment gains earlier in the year," <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> economist Jonathan Basile wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Hardin Optical</span> is among the companies that are cutting back. The Bandon, Ore., maker of face plates for night-vision goggles, among other equipment, has laid off about a third of its workforce, which once approached 100, amid military budget cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our main customer is just seeing less work through the government, and that trickles down to us," said Michael Hardin, general manager, adding that the company's efforts to diversify its business have yet to pay off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market continues to bump along the bottom. Sales of previously owned homes fell 2.6% in March from February, according to the National Association of Realtors, meaning that the rise in buyer traffic during the mild winter hasn't yet translated into strong sales gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sales were still 5.2% above last year's levels, fueling the strongest first quarter for home sales since 2007, when the housing bubble was deflating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, home-sales gains have been driven largely by investors paying cash. The Realtors' survey indicated that investor activity had pulled back in March, which could explain the unexpected easing in sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of traditional buyers making purchases "hasn't really changed for the last six months," said economist Patrick Newport of IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales remain sluggish in part because many buyers don't have enough cash for a down payment or can't qualify for a loan, despite the fact that mortgage rates have fallen to near-record lows, making housing cheap in many markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, sellers are holding their homes off the market, which is leaving many housing markets with a shortage of properties for sale at a time when there are more buyers looking. "Buyers have come out early, but sellers haven't," said Mark Vitner, senior economist at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing isn't likely to recover until the job market does, said Doug Duncan, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>. "We have a lot of households that are holding back, and until we get job growth, they're not going to unfold," Mr. Duncan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing sector also is showing signs of cooling. Factory output slipped in March after rising a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surveys from <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> Banks in Philadelphia and New York this week showed manufacturing in those regions slowed in April. Economists said a likely recession in Europe and slowing growth in China could be hurting demand for U.S. products overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weak reports in manufacturing, housing and jobs have revived fears that the economy could repeat the pattern of the past two years, when growth picked up early in the year only to slow sharply in the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But economists also noted important differences between this year and last. Oil prices, which were among the factors behind last year's stall, have moderated in recent weeks. The European debt crisis, though still a risk, hasn't surged to critical levels. And the world hasn't seen a repeat of the natural disasters that disrupted global supply chains last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, some aspects of the economy still seem to be improving. Retail and auto sales have posted two months of strong gains, and consumer confidence hasn't been hit by high gasoline prices. Households are continuing to work out from under the debt burden accrued before the recession, and companies have trillions of dollars in cash to help them weather any slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The whole economy's on better footing," said Paul Dales, an economist for research firm Capital Analytics. "I just don't think we're going to see a full-on collapse in growth."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Lawson, who runs a staffing firm in the Dallas area, said business has been up in recent months as employers have finally gained the confidence to start hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent signs of weakness in the jobs market haven't damped clients' enthusiasm, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a slow, gradual process, where we might have some steps forward and some steps back," Mr. Lawson said. "But the vibe and the pulse that I get is that companies are hiring."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Alan Zibel and Eric Morath   </div><div>438 words</div><div>19 April 2012</div><div>10:07</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. fell in March for the second-straight month, a sign that the housing market's long-awaited recovery may be flagging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales decreased 2.6% in March from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.48 million, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. The results were worse than expected. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected home sales to rise by 0.4% on a monthly basis from the previously reported February figure to an annual rate of 4.61 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the monthly decline, however, the first three months of 2012 were the strongest start to the year for existing home sales since 2007. March's sales were 5.2% above the same month last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of previously owned homes listed for sale, meanwhile, increased to 2.37 million at the end of February. That represented a 6.3-month supply at the current sales pace, a pace considered healthy by economists. "We are hearing more and more from Realtors about the shortage of inventory," said Lawrence Yun, the Realtors' top economist. "They have clients that want to buy but cannot find a property."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price in March was $163,800, up 2.5% from $159,800 a year earlier. One reason for the price increase, the Realtors group said, is a declining share of foreclosures and other distressed properties. Those made up 29% of March's sales, down from 40% a year earlier, according to a monthly survey taken by the Realtors' group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has displayed mixed signals of late as it copes with the aftermath after a collapse in prices that started in summer 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowing of job growth in March, after a strong start to the year, may only make potential home buyers more reluctant. In some markets where the economy is strong and the glut of foreclosures has dwindled, sales have been healthy and there has been competition for properties. Other markets, however, are coping with a large glut of foreclosures and weak economies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' report said home sales fell compared with a month earlier in three out of four U.S. regions. Sales in the West sank 7.4%. They were down 1.7% in the Northeast and 1.1% in the South but were unchanged in the Midwest.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two expected sales of U.K. student housing totaling GBP 1.4 billion ($2.23 billion) have highlighted the attraction of investors to alternative property classes in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Barclays Capital PLC</span> is close to selling its majority stake in the University Partnerships Programme, which has 22,000 student rooms, to Dutch pension fund PGGM for GBP 1 billion. Meantime, U.S. private-equity giant <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group L.P</span>. is expected to sell its Nido student-accommodation blocks, in London's Spitalfields, King's Cross and Notting Hill districts, to Round Hill Capital for more than GBP 400 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both deals are expected to close next month, according to one real-estate agent. <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> and <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">International real-estate investors increasingly are looking to buy student accommodation, health-care facilities and hotels in Europe, industry observers say. While some investors are driven by the prospect of higher returns and more-stable income streams, others simply can't find good deals in traditional sectors such as commercial and office space amid a shortage of stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Pension funds and annuity funds are increasingly targeting alternative investments because of the shortage of long-term, securely let, traditional real estate on the market in Europe," said James Hanson, lead director, health care, at property-services company <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts say sectors such as student housing, which is valued at GBP 20 billion in the U.K. alone, and health care offer stable, noncyclical income to investors and long leases, of around 15 to 25 years, while providing high occupancy levels and low rental default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, health-care real-estate investment is expected to rise to GBP 500 million this year from GBP 300 million in 2011, Mr. Hanson said. Companies are likely to undertake significant sale and leasebacks in 2012 and 2013, driving investment volumes, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition already is growing in the U.K. Investment inflows into the student market are expected to exceed GBP 2 billion in 2012, compared with GBP 950.6 million in 2011, according to Jones Lang. So far this year, 11 deals already have taken place, totaling GBP 337.4 million, the company said. The deals include Student Castle's purchase of the 617-room Goodman's Fields development in London for GBP 80 million and <span class="companylink">Carlyle Group</span>'s GBP 46 million purchase of three London sites, on which it plans to build student housing with 1,400 beds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such niche assets can come with their own complications. Finding suitable sites for doctors' surgeries, student housing or hotels, especially the much-in-demand budget variety, isn't easy, industry participants say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.K., "a restrictive planning regime makes it difficult for developers to adapt existing buildings to student homes, and major new developments are usually opposed by planners," said Philip Hillman, a director at Jones Lang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while private involvement in student housing is still limited in many parts of Europe, Mr. Hillman said, "there are a small number of developers who are beginning to build up new portfolios of purpose[-built] accommodation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With long, secure income driven by robust occupational demand and benefiting from a significant yield premium to traditional real-estate sectors, alternative investments such as health care or student housing in Europe are expected to outperform," said Dan Bowden, a fund manager at European asset-management company AXA Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bowden, who heads the AXA Real Estate-Managed European Alternative Property Income Venture, with some 600 million euros ($788 million) of assets under management, said he hasn't had a year of negative total real-estate returns since the fund opened in 2007. "AXA Real Estate will increase investment into defensive alternative real estate such as health care, and we are currently considering the launch of a second alternative fund, as there is clear investor demand," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Hanson of <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> warns, "while there is demand for hospitals, elderly care facilities and primary-care facilities, capital for development is extremely difficult to procure."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. private-equity company <span class="companylink">Carlyle Group</span> earlier this month launched a student-accommodation business and is aiming to double its investment in London, forming a portfolio worth GBP 700 million in the next couple of years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home building declined in March but new permits reached their highest level since September 2008, showing the sector is struggling even as builders anticipate demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, U.S. industrial output remained flat for the second consecutive month in March, as a key engine of the economy shows signs of stalling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction decreased 5.8% from February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 654,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. It was the second straight monthly decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reading was far below expectations. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast housing starts would rise by 0.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 703,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of single-family homes, which made up 71% of housing starts last month, fell by 0.2%. Meanwhile, multifamily homes with at least two units, a volatile part of the market, posted a 16.9% loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">February's figures were revised to a rate of 694,000 starts from a previously reported 698,000. The newly stated data reflect a 2.8% decline from January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year's numbers, while up from a low of 478,000 in April 2009, are well below the historical average. Builders have started construction on about 1.5 million new homes per year since 1959.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of new housing permits, an indication of future construction, rose by 4.5% in March to annualized level of 747,000. Economists had forecast permits to drop by 0.3% to an annual rate of 713,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The uneven recovery of the housing market, including new home construction, has weighed on the overall economic rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This unusually weak recovery can be at least partly explained by the large drop in house prices and severe slump in housing activity," Federal Reserve governor Sarah Bloom Raskin said in a speech last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Showing how difficult it is for the sector to climb out its five-year-long slump, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>' confidence reading, released Monday, slipped for the first time in seven months in April, indicating that potential home buyers have been hesitant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowing job growth in March, after a strong start to the year, may make buyers more reluctant. Shoppers also have a choice of existing homes, including a glut of foreclosures, which tend to be more affordable than new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce data showed that housing starts were mixed across four U.S. regions. New building declined 15.9% in the South and was unchanged in the West, from the prior month. The Northeast posted a 32.8% improvement in March and the Midwest recorded a 1.0% gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actual housing starts, calculated without seasonal adjustments, increased to 54,500 in March from a downwardly revised 47,900 in February. Lumber and commodities markets watch those numbers closely to gauge demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production was unchanged last month, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> said Tuesday. February's output figures were also unrevised, with no change from the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another indication of an industrial slowdown, capacity utilization slipped to 78.6% from an upwardly revised 78.7% the previous month. Operating rates remain below the 1972-2011 average just above 80%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing activity eased 0.2% following a 0.8% rise in February. Manufacturing has played a key role in the economic recovery, but production is expected to continue to moderate along with the overall economy during the first half of the year. Year over year, industrial production is up 3.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest Institute for Supply Management report showed that manufacturing activity remains in expansion mode. The ISM's manufacturing index climbed to 53.4 last month from 52.4 in February. Any readings above 50 signal an expansion in activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were some areas of strength in the Fed's report Tuesday. Utilities production jumped 1.5% in March after a 0.1% gain the previous month. Output in the mining industry recovered 0.2% following a 4.0% drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Production of motor vehicles and parts remained solid, climbing 0.6% in March after a 0.8% gain the month before. But motor vehicle assemblies fell to a seasonally adjusted 9.99 million units in March from 10.12 million in February, the first decline since November.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the heat of the real-estate boom, <span class="companylink">MGM Resorts International</span> and <span class="companylink">Dubai World</span> made an ill-fated bet that the Las Vegas real-estate and gambling market would stay strong for years to come, launching an $8.5 billion casino resort called City Center soon before the market turned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, after years of struggles, they are betting that the Las Vegas condo market is approaching a bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an effort to jump-start sales, the owners of City Center are lowering prices of 602 unsold condominium units in two properties. The reduction, set to be announced Wednesday, includes a 10% drop in face price and incentives like monthly condo association fees and a premium concierge service. All combined, it amounts to a 25% discount off the current prices, the company says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This marks the second price cut for the two properties -- a high-end Mandarin Oriental and the twin-angled, 37-story Veer Towers. The lowest-priced units at Veer Towers are down to $315,000 from $500,000 initially sought, not including the added incentives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City Center's developers say they are making the new discounts now because they believe the property is changing course. Since 2010, sales have been stagnant, but MGM says it believes the condo market in Las Vegas is nearing an end to its five-year fall. "We're on the cusp of a recovery," says Tony Dennis, executive vice president with City Center. "You have to spur the market along -- the demand isn't there freely and naturally."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas has experienced some of the worst of the housing bust, exacerbated by overbuilding. Home prices in January in the Las Vegas area were down more than 60% since spring 2006, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, including a 9% drop during 2011. Luxury high-rise condo towers that were constructed on or around the Las Vegas Strip at the height of the development frenzy were particularly affected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some hard-hit markets in the U.S. have begun to show signs of recovery. The high-rise condo market in Miami, for instance, has been buoyed by surprisingly strong demand from foreign buyers, and the Phoenix housing market has recently seen a large jump in demand from investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Las Vegas economy isn't as diverse as better-performing cities, there are some glimmers of improvement. Housing inventory levels are less than half a year ago, according to Applied Analysis, an economic consulting firm in Las Vegas. And gambling revenue on the Las Vegas Strip is up for the past six months through February, while visitation and room rates also have continued to edge up, according to the Las Vegas Visitors and Convention Authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The attempt to restart condominium sales at City Center comes about six years after the developers broke ground on the 67-acre project, which, even in a city of extravagance, stood out as grandiose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers said that the project would be a lively mixed-use new urban center on the Las Vegas Strip -- complete with condos, gambling, shopping and hotels. But the number of condos was scaled back as the economy cooled and because one of the towers was halted by a construction defect. Between the two components that now have condos -- the Veer Towers and Mandarin Oriental -- there are nearly 900 condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City Center has sold only around 292 units in those projects for $294 million. It hopes that it will take in nearly $600 million by 2017 from the sale of the remaining condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MGM has written down around $2.3 billion due to a severe drop in value in its 50% ownership interest in City Center. On top of that, the City Center joint venture has written down more than $700 million from the residential sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If sales pick up, Mr. Dennis, of City Center, expects the first buyers will largely be investors who plan to rent out the units while holding them for at least a few years.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years after a deflating U.S. housing bubble sparked a global financial crisis, housing worries in the U.S. and other countries are weighing on the world economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Spain, the latest euro-zone nation to trigger tremors in global markets, households and banks are struggling with the fallout from the bursting of their own property bubble. Chinese policy makers are trying to cool their country's housing boom so it doesn't damage the world's second-largest economy. And in the U.S., the hobbled housing market continues to hold back the economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The International Monetary Fund this week will urge the world's top finance ministers meeting in Washington to take more aggressive action to help households burdened by mortgage debt. Doing so, fund officials argue, would help boost consumer spending and global growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the U.S., the IMF ranks housing alongside the federal budget deficit as the top areas needing urgent attention from policy makers. U.S. home prices have dropped 34% since a 2006 peak, and more than two million properties are in foreclosure. Almost one in four homeowners is "underwater," meaning they owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Specifically, the IMF waded into a politically charged debate by backing the Obama administration's proposal to use taxpayer money to reduce mortgage-loan balances for some underwater homeowners. A key housing regulator has expressed skepticism about the plan, and many Republicans oppose it, worried it could encourage borrowers to default on their mortgages in hopes of having their debt reduced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde last week publicly endorsed the idea of reducing U.S. mortgage balances. "American households have to be able to unload a bit," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The IMF's new analysis of 99 housing busts across 25 advanced economies over the past three decades found that housing crises preceded by large surges in household debt tend to be more severe, with an economic slump persisting at least five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pattern has played out around the world. At the end of a housing boom, indebted households cut spending, pushing down overall economic demand, employment and incomes. "That sets off a negative chain reaction with more defaults, banks being more worried about lending, and there can be long-term damage to the economy," said IMF economist Daniel Leigh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spain, which is well into that cycle, faces severe economic turmoil. In 2007, the end of a decadelong boom in home construction pushed Spanish employment and spending down. The resulting budget woes are fanning fears the country will need a financial bailout, worsening the European debt crisis. Home prices in Spain have dropped more than 20% since 2007, but many analysts believe they need to drop at least 20% more. Spanish banks are still sitting on a pile of troubled loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China, on the other hand, didn't fuel its housing boom with household debt. But a large run-up in home prices hangs over its economy. Prices have dropped a bit, and Chinese officials worry that a steeper fall could hurt an already slowing economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By one measure, China had a bigger housing boom than many others. China's investment in residential housing reached about 9% of its economy last year, a threshold matched only by Spain in 2007, according to Nicholas Lardy, a China expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The peak for the U.S. was 6% in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's real-estate boom started in 2004 as inflation-adjusted interest rates for bank deposits turned negative, a government policy that pushed savers to shun banks. "People have piled into property because you can't put your money abroad and the stock market is rigged," Mr. Lardy said. China's government has tried to let air out of the bubble. But incentives remain for households to pour money into real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because China's bubble was so big, experts say its housing problems could hang over the country for years, slowing growth. As home prices decline, sales in the broader economy -- such as steel used in home construction and the household goods that go inside -- also will fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government actions can help ease the pain of a burst housing bubble, the IMF concluded in its analysis, which is part of its semiannual economic outlook being released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The IMF points to the U.S. during the Great Depression, when the government-created Home Owners' Loan Corp. bought distressed mortgages from lenders and restructured them, freeing up cash for households to spend. "By making mortgage payments more affordable, it effectively transferred funds to households with distressed mortgages that had a higher marginal propensity to consume," the IMF said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That intervention started in 1933, four years after a stock-market crash and eight years after home prices peaked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One lesson, according to the IMF: Delaying action prolongs the pain.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climbing rents for apartments are combining with a continued decline in home prices to push once-reluctant home buyers into finally taking the plunge, say economists and real-estate agents, helping what appears to be a good start to the housing industry's all-important spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although increased buying activity from investors and second-home purchasers are also factors behind the recent pickup in home sales, real-estate agents say they are fielding more calls from anxious tenants complaining about rising rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The rental market has been incredibly hot," said Ronald Peltier, chief executive of HomeServices of America Inc., which owns real-estate brokerages in 21 states. He says rising rents, coupled with slumping home prices and interest rates near record lows, are boosting demand for homes at entry-level prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average apartment rents rose by 2.7% last year while the national vacancy rate dropped below 5% for the first time since 2001, according to a quarterly survey to be released Wednesday by <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broad and sustained growth of the apartment market contrasts sharply with an uneven and tentative housing recovery. During the first quarter, average apartment rents rose and vacancy rates fell in all 82 metropolitan areas tracked by Reis, when compared with a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest rent increases came in San Francisco and San Jose, Calif., which saw increases of 5.9% and 4.9%, respectively. Even boom-to-bust Las Vegas, which has struggled with falling rents in previous quarters, saw average rent rise 1.8% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such increases are one reason why analysts at Zelman &amp; Associates believe 2012 will be the first year since 2005 when the share of apartment renters that moves out to buy a house increases from the previous year. "The equation of renting versus owning is becoming much more favorable for owning," said Ivy Zelman, the firm's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless the economy worsens, there is little sign that rent growth will slow until hundreds of thousands of new apartment units currently under construction hit the market over the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nishu Sood, a housing analyst with <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> who tracks housing costs, says that, historically, the cost to rent an apartment has been about 10% lower than the after-tax cost of owning a home. That rental discount began to fall in 2010 and disappeared entirely last year. By the end of 2011, Mr. Sood's research found that the cost to rent an apartment was about 15% higher than the cost to own a home. Conditions are "overwhelming in the favor of buying now. It is unequivocal," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Jose and the Silicon Valley, where home prices have tumbled 36% from the mid-2007 peak, home affordability has more than doubled in the last five years, Mr. Sood said. Affordability has also improved in Long Island and northern New Jersey, where during the boom, renting was half as expensive as buying. Now, it is almost equal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, not all markets have seen the same development. In Orange County, Calif., and New York City, where home prices are extremely high, renting is still cheaper. But even in New York, real-estate agents say sales of small studio and one-bedroom apartments are brisk because renters don't want to pay such high amounts to rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jennifer Regan and her husband went under contract to buy a three-bedroom home in Martinez, Calif., last month. With a 4.25% rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage, their monthly payments, including taxes and insurance, will be around $600 less than what it costs to rent a comparable house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I couldn't believe it had gotten so expensive" to rent, said Ms. Regan, 36 years old, who is moving before her oldest son starts school this fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't always easy for individual home buyers to make it to the closing table, however. Lending and appraisal standards remain tight, keeping many would-be buyers out of the market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Address: 1435 Woodland Ave., Menlo Park</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vital Statistics: A 1,736-square-foot ranch-style home with three bedrooms and two full bathrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asking Price: $1.295 million. The house was previously listed in 2011 for $1.429 million. (The house has received multiple offers and is now under contract for more than the asking price, but the sellers are accepting backup offers, their real-estate agent says.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previous Sale Price: Owners Annie and Matt Stanley paid $985,000 for the house in December 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notable: The home is located in The Willows area of Menlo Park, where a new neighbor has moved in down the road: <span class="companylink">Facebook Inc</span>. While the median home sales price in The Willows is rising -- it was $1.275 million as of March 29, up from around $1.14 million a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> agent Gwen Wang -- being located just minutes from <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s headquarters hasn't so far had a huge effect on prices, say real-estate agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of people think [the <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> effect] is going to be a tsunami and I think it's going to be a ripple," says Derk Brill of Alain Pinel Realtors. Keller Williams's Ms. Wang notes while the market in The Willows is strong and inventory is low, the <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> demographic is younger and not necessarily ready to start shopping for a family home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is exactly the kind of house the Stanleys now have for sale. The couple says they spent five months and more than $250,000 remodeling the 1950s-era home, opening up the living room to create a larger entertaining space and adding oak floors and French doors that lead out to the patio. When they replaced the roof, they put in vaulted ceilings. In the kitchen, they chose granite counters and a farm sink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house was just right for the couple and their first child, but the unexpected arrival of twins (who are now 2 months old) meant the family outgrew the space sooner than planned. "We'll miss it as it's where we started our family," says Mr. Stanley, who, along with his wife, is a financial adviser.</p>
