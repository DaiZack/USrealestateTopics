</div><div class="author">By Carrick Mollenkamp and Lingling Wei </div><div>1461 words</div><div>16 September 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>21</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year after <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>' collapse, the firm overseeing its bankruptcy is moving to restructure loans for 900 properties to help salvage a battered $16 billion real-estate portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moves -- involving commercial real-estate properties ranging from huge apartment holdings to office buildings to a Miami condominium complex -- portend the strategies big U.S. banks are likely to undertake as they deal with their own troubled loans and buildings over the next 18 months, specialists say. In some cases, Lehman is generating new loans or even agreeing to buy condominium mortgages to keep projects afloat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The massive restructuring of a portfolio that contributed to Lehman's bankruptcy also has turned up fresh details of the mess Lehman has on its hands. The Lehman holdings now in U.S. bankruptcy court dropped in value by an estimated $5.4 billion between the weekend it filed for bankruptcy and Dec. 31, stemming from a deteriorating market and overly lofty "marks," or valuations, by Lehman before the bankruptcy, according to court proceedings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, Lehman may be forced to wait until the property market improves. "It's not a great time to sell today," says Bryan Marsal, chief restructuring officer and chief executive at Lehman and head of Alvarez &amp;Marsal, the advisory firm overseeing Lehman's bankruptcy proceedings. But he adds: "We aren't passively waiting for a better market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman's restructuring efforts could provide a template for other banks. U.S. banks and thrifts hold more than $1.2 trillion in commercial mortgages backed by offices, hotels, shopping malls and apartments, according to <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span>. Now, with property values down and credit still scarce, losses for the commercial-property lenders could total $115 billion to $150 billion, according to a Deutsche report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman's restructuring team faces a tough road. As the big securities firm bulked up its real-estate holdings, it ended up holding, for example, at least $2 billion in Florida real-estate projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 66 people overseeing the Lehman portfolio, in addition to 250 outside contractors, represent the "biggest real-estate workout department in the U.S.," Mr. Marsal says. Inside his office, a whiteboard details the projects his firm has been working on as it deals with creditors and federal bankruptcy court to wind down Lehman. Mr. Marsal said it could take three to five years to work through the loans and equity stakes in properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The workout process is creating haves and have-nots. Among the Lehman borrowers that haven't been successful in restructuring loans are developers of a Tennessee golf-and-residential development, according to documents filed in the Lehman bankruptcy proceedings. The loan for the project ended up with a Lehman unit in Bermuda and is being overseen in separate court proceedings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers have stopped the project with nine of 18 holes completed. Philip Jones, president of Tentara Partners Inc., which is overseeing the project, said, "This project will be successful once all this is behind us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New details also are emerging about the borrowers that did business with Lehman. Among them is Las Vegas developer Kenneth Jowdy. Mr. Jowdy and other investors used Lehman loans to fund sprawling golf-course and residential developments in Mexico, Texas and Tennessee. Investors in one project allege in a suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in June that Mr. Jowdy falsified financial statements as part of his loan application to Lehman for the Mexican project and that Mr. Jowdy arranged for porn stars and strippers to attend company-funded functions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group suing Mr. Jowdy allege Mr. Jowdy mismanaged the project and wasted millions of dollars. A spokesman for Mr. Jowdy said the Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, project is on track and a golf course will be open next month. The spokesman also said the suit offers no proof porn stars and strippers were hired. The spokesman says the lawsuit's allegations "are preposterous, absurd and not based in fact."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, distressed-debt buyers such as hedge fund <span class="companylink">Paulson &amp;Co</span>. have acquired Lehman debt and formed an ad-hoc creditors group monitoring Mr. Marsal's moves, calling for more disclosure to ensure creditors are kept up to date on decisions that could affect their return. A Lehman spokeswoman said the restructuring team has been communicating with all creditors and providing information in public filings as required by bankruptcy law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An advantage for Mr. Marsal is that the bankrupt Lehman doesn't have to worry about big write-downs. Other banks are less willing to take write-downs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. banks have been unwilling to restructure real-estate loans because that would force them to mark down the value of their holdings and lead to increased capital costs, according to many specialists. Mr. Marsal says the loan restructurings that Lehman is undertaking today are a window into the types of loan workouts other banks will pursue this year and next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of banks don't want to take write-downs and take over properties. Now we're out of the business, so we don't have that [concern]," Mr. Marsal says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman's efforts to deal with a Miami condominium project provide one look into how Mr. Marsal's firm is operating. In 2006 and 2007, Lehman and a subsidiary provided more than $522 million in construction and mezzanine loans to Miami developer WSG Development Co., which planned to use the money to build a 580-condominium project called Canyon Ranch Living Miami Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea behind the project was that condo buyers would be able to use spa facilities managed by Canyon Ranch, a well-known health and fitness facility operator. But by 2008 the project was stalled. Just 209 units had been sold, so there wasn't enough money for WSG to repay debts owed to Lehman and its subsidiary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman had its own problems in 2008 as it tried to raise cash and stay afloat. In the spring of last year, for example, the Lehman subsidiary used the construction loans on the Miami project as collateral for a $238.9 million loan from <span class="companylink">Fortress Investment Group LLC</span>, the private-equity and hedge-fund group that specializes in distressed debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To close that loan, the Lehman subsidiary agreed to pay outsize interest of London interbank offered rate plus 6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To prevent Fortress from foreclosing on the condo complex and to end the high interest payments due to Fortress, Lehman's restructuring team got court approval in June to pay off the Fortress loan. Fortress didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Marsal and his team faced another difficult choice. The Lehman unit had the option to foreclose on the project, but Lehman's restructuring team would have faced the same challenges in trying to sell the condos, according to court papers. So Lehman and Mr. Marsal launched a "mortgage financing program" that effectively puts Lehman back in the condo-lending business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under a plan that received court approval, a lender is providing loans to condo borrowers and Lehman has agreed to purchase as much as $200 million worth of the condo loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Marsal says sales have perked up and that 32 units have been sold since May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some restructuring moves also are helping other banks that had teamed with Lehman. One stems from the October 2007 purchase of Archstone-Smith, a real-estate investment trust that owns 70,000 residential units, by a partnership between Lehman and Tishman Speyer Properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To complete the deal, Lehman, <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Barclays PLC</span> arranged $15 billion in financing, $9 billion of which was sold to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. When the mortgage market seized up, Lehman retained about $3 billion of the loans, while <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> kept $1.7 billion and <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> held about $1.5 billion, according to Lehman's bankruptcy documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon after the deal closed, stock prices of apartment REITs fell sharply. Last year Archstone was generating cash, but not enough from apartment rent or selling assets to pay interest on the debt. If the Archstone project fell into default, the lenders would have to put the debt on nonaccrual status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a move supported by <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>, Lehman sought bankruptcy-court approval to provide Archstone $485 million in additional funding. Representatives for <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That new funding, including $227 million from Lehman and the rest from <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, now is covering the interest costs to the banks in what is effectively a circular movement of cash that keeps the loan current.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AFTER a year of extraordinary interventions in the economy, the U.S. government is starting to pare its support for the private sector. It doesn't look that way to Peter Lansing, president of mortgage firm Universal Lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Denver home lender sees every day how dependent the housing market has become on the government. At the height of the boom, just 20% of Universal's mortgages were backed by the Federal Housing Administration, an arm of the government that guarantees loans to borrowers who can't afford big down payments. Today, the FHA accounts for more than 80% of his business. For Mr. Lansing, this represents a new way of life -- more government, more paperwork, but also a lot of sales that wouldn't have happened otherwise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Over 29 years in business, we've always thought of ourselves as being in the free-enterprise system. Today I think of myself as a government contractor," Mr. Lansing says. "My business strategy is to get more of my employees to embrace that idea. Plan B would be to sell pencils on the corner."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech on Wall Street a year after <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> collapsed, President Barack Obama said Monday the need for the government to keep stabilizing the financial system "is waning." His administration released a 51-page report detailing rescue programs that are slowly being scaled back. But the Treasury Department, author of the report, noted that housing is one area where it is too early to exit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year, the government has intervened heavily at essentially every stage of the home-buying process. In fact, more than 80% of the new residential mortgage loans made this year benefited from some form of government support, according to the trade publication Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To keep funds flowing to the housing market, the government bailed out <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> last year and now effectively owns the mortgage-finance giants and their combined $5.4 trillion in loans and guarantees. To keep mortgage rates low, the Federal Reserve is on track to purchase nearly $1.5 trillion in debt issued or guaranteed by the government's various mortgage arms and an additional $300 billion in Treasurys, which set the benchmark for home lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And to boost sales, the government also is offering $8,000 tax credits to first-time home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those efforts appear to have had the intended effect of braking the housing market's plunge. They prompted Jonathan Swinton and his wife, Annie, to plunge into the market ahead of schedule. The couple plans to close on a $226,000 home in a suburb of Salt Lake City in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had always wanted to buy a home, but we had been planning to wait a couple of years," says Mr. Swinton, who recently completed course work for a Ph.D. in family therapy and is now working at a mental-health facility in Salt Lake City. "The low interest rates and the tax credit were the two primary factors that motivated us to buy this year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of a housing-market bottom have emerged. Sales of new homes are up more than 30% from lows reached early this year, and sales of existing homes are up nearly 17%. Shares of companies that build homes have turned higher, inventories of unsold new homes are down and home prices have ticked up after steep declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's efforts are the primary reason the housing market is functioning at all, economists and housing experts say. Despite the signs of improvement, the housing market is still a shell of what it was during headier times. U.S. home prices are back around 2003 levels, having fallen by about one-third since their peak in the second quarter of 2006, according to <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>. Sales of distressed homes still account for about one-third of existing home sales, and prices continue to fall in some markets such as the Sun Belt states. In addition, relatively few "jumbo" loans are being made -- those above the limits of what Fannie and Freddie will buy or guarantee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At least for the next two years, and possibly longer, it is not possible that the government would say: 'The U.S. mortgage market no longer needs our support,'" says Dwight Jaffee, an economics professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. "Were they to say that, the mortgage market and the housing market would almost surely crash."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Promoting homeownership has been a stated goal of Republican and Democratic presidencies for decades. The Obama administration recognizes it will need -- at some point -- to rethink broadly the government's role in housing and mortgages. Administration officials also acknowledge that moment won't come soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every government in the world takes a role in its country's housing market," says Lawrence Summers, Mr. Obama's top economic-policy adviser. "What that role should be when normal conditions return is a crucial question we'll all be considering in coming months and coming years." He added: "It's clearly going to take time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's role in housing has a long pedigree. The 1930s gave birth to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and the FHA, which traditionally insured loans aimed at low-income borrowers. <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> was created in 1970. Since the housing crash, these players are in some spots the only game in town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their backing means private lenders are assured of repayment -- by the government, if not the borrower. The size of loan that can be guaranteed is capped in most parts of the U.S. at $417,000, but can reach as high as $729,750 in high-cost areas such as parts of California, New York and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loans above those levels are hard to obtain. Steve Walsh, a mortgage broker in Arizona, said he recently tried to arrange a mortgage for a married couple who wanted to buy a $1.5 million home in Mesa. The couple offered a down payment of $400,000, but the lender wanted $600,000, or 40%, in part because the couple had opened a law firm and didn't have two years of tax returns. That is double what was considered standard before the boom. The pair walked away, Mr. Walsh said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government temporarily raised the size of the loans Fannie and Freddie can guarantee in February 2008 and is unlikely to ever return to previous levels. The higher levels have been extended once, and the mortgage industry is lobbying to keep them high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Fed, the question of whether to start dismantling the scaffolding is a dominant one. Since the beginning of the year, the Fed has purchased $836 billion of mortgage-backed securities issued by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and Ginnie Mae, the federal body that securitizes FHA loans. The purchases have helped push down interest rates on mortgages guaranteed by the firms from more than 6.5% last October to 5.15% today, according to HSH Associates, which tracks the mortgage market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That seems to have helped to put a floor under housing sooner than many officials expected. At the same time, it has created distortions in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Fed buys as much as $30 billion in mortgage securities every week, regardless of price, "it makes it very difficult for the market to find its own equilibrium," says Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of U.S. fixed-income research at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>. He said investors are trading instead in Treasury securities, where activity is less skewed by central-bank purchases, and pushing rates lower in that market, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed is likely to decide to carry on buying until it reaches the $1.25 trillion target it set in March and taper off the buying gradually. Some Fed officials will likely argue for stopping sooner, even as soon as next week's regular policy meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Fed stops sooner than expected, it could jolt the mortgage market and short-circuit a housing recovery. <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>'s Mr. Rajadhyaksha estimates that even if the Fed carries on as planned, mortgage rates will rise by half to three-quarters of a percentage point, simply because the Fed will cease to be as a big a presence in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed will face a challenge managing its portfolio of mortgage-backed securities even after it stops buying the securities. When it bought the securities, it effectively flooded the financial system with cash. Officials at some point will need to find ways to drain that cash from the financial system. If they move too slowly, it could lead to inflation. If they move too aggressively, it could damage the fragile mortgage market. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has laid out plans that he says will allow him to do it and to raise interest rates as needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit for first-time home buyers, which provides as much as $8,000 for individuals earning up to $75,000 and couples earning up to $150,000, is set to expire in November. It was originally included in the U.S.'s $787 billion stimulus bill passed in February. Congress, increasingly preoccupied with mounting deficits, will have to decide whether to extend it. <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> estimates the credit has helped generate 350,000 sales, about half the increase in single-family-home sales in the past six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit's effectiveness depends largely on its longevity. That is because many of the home sales analysts think it has spurred have been stolen from the future, luring buyers into the market who might not otherwise have bought until next year or beyond. When the credit expires, that demand will disappear, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All it does is move demand forward in time," says Kenneth Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at UC Berkeley. "The last six months, we've seen signs of a housing bottom. We could easily see that disappear."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom McCormick, president of Astoria Homes, a private home builder in Las Vegas, says the government's efforts to prop up the housing market are making a difference, but he says his own business remains very fragile. "The tax credit is what we think got people off the fence," he says. "Once that money came in back in February, the market literally jumped 10% to 20%."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he says, most home buyers are buying existing or foreclosed homes, meaning the new-home market has barely budged. At his peak in 2005, he built more than 1,000 homes. This year, he expects to do fewer than 100. "It is just real dark right now," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet more uncertain is the future of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, an already difficult policy question exacerbated by the passions the pair evoke. When they were placed under government control last year, officials described the move as a "timeout" while they find a permanent solution. Mr. Bernanke has floated the idea of turning them into a public utility or privatizing them and offering government insurance on their bonds for a fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration has put off wrestling with that question. It expects to issue a proposal by March 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't feel like the world is anywhere close to us being able pull back our support," one administration official says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FHA brings its own tough issues. The agency, which insures private lenders against defaults on certain home mortgages, has seen its balance sheet take a hit as risky borrowers default on those loans and is already in danger of falling below a level of reserves mandated by Congress. Yet it remains a key facilitator of loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teri Gifford, who runs a mortgage brokerage serving Kentucky and Ohio, says 95% of her business involves getting clients loans backed by the FHA. "It's all government loans," says Ms. Gifford, whose firm, EZ Mortgage Loans Inc., Hillsboro, Ohio, brokers between $30 million and $35 million in loans each year. "That's all that can be done anymore."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gifford fears that the U.S. will pull back if the loans it is backing start going bad. "I'm worried what the future could hold if we put all the eggs in one basket," she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government temporarily raised the size of the loans Fannie and Freddie can guarantee in February 2008 and is unlikely to ever return to previous levels. The higher levels have been extended once, and the mortgage industry is lobbying to keep them high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Fed, the question of whether to start dismantling the scaffolding is a dominant one. Since the beginning of the year, the Fed has purchased $836 billion of mortgage-backed securities issued by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and Ginnie Mae, the federal body that securitizes FHA loans. The purchases have helped push down interest rates on mortgages guaranteed by the firms from more than 6.5% last October to 5.15% today, according to HSH Associates, which tracks the mortgage market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That seems to have helped to put a floor under housing sooner than many officials expected. At the same time, it has created distortions in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Fed buys up to $30 billion in mortgage securities every week, regardless of price, "it makes it very difficult for the market to find its own equilibrium," says Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of U.S. fixed-income research at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>. He said investors are trading instead in Treasury securities, where activity is less skewed by central bank purchases, and pushing rates lower in that market, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed is likely to decide to carry on buying until it reaches the $1.25 trillion target it set in March and taper off the buying gradually. Some Fed officials will likely argue for stopping sooner, even as soon as next week's regular policy meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Fed stops sooner than expected, it could jolt the mortgage market and short-circuit a housing recovery. <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>'s Mr. Rajadhyaksha estimates that even if the Fed carries on as planned, mortgage rates will rise by half to three-quarters of a percentage point, simply because the Fed will cease to be as a big a presence in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed will face a challenge managing its portfolio of mortgage-backed securities even after it stops buying the securities. When it bought the securities, it effectively flooded the financial system with cash. Officials at some point will need to find ways to drain that cash from the financial system. If they move too slowly, it could lead to inflation. If they move to aggressively, it could damage the fragile mortgage market. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has laid out plans that he says will allow him to do it and to raise interest rates as needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit for first-time home buyers, which provides up to $8,000 for individuals earning up to $75,000 and couples earning up to $150,000, is set to expire in November. It was originally included in the $787 billion stimulus bill passed in February. Congress, increasingly preoccupied with mounting deficits, will have to decide whether to extend it. <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> estimates the credit has helped generate 350,000 sales, about half the increase in single-family home sales in the past six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit's effectiveness depends largely on its longevity. That's because many of the home sales analysts think it has spurred have been stolen from the future, luring buyers into the market who might not otherwise have bought until next year or beyond. When the credit expires, that demand will disappear, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All it does is move demand forward in time," says Kenneth Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California, Berkeley. "The last six months, we've seen signs of a housing bottom. We could easily see that disappear."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom McCormick, president of Astoria Homes, a private home builder in Las Vegas, says the government's efforts to prop up the housing market are making a difference, but says his own business remains very fragile. "The tax credit is what we think got people off the fence," he says. "Once that money came in back in February, the market literally jumped 10% to 20%."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he says, most home buyers are buying existing or foreclosed homes, meaning the new home market has barely budged. At his peak in 2005, he built more than 1,000 homes. This year, he expects to do fewer than 100. "It is just real dark right now," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet more uncertain is the future of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, an already difficult policy question exacerbated by the passions the pair evoke. When they were placed under government control last year, officials described the move as a "timeout" while they find a permanent solution. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has floated the idea of turning them into a public utility or privatizing them and offering government insurance on their bonds for a fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration has put off wrestling with that question until next year. It expects to issue a proposal by March 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't feel like the world is anywhere close to us being able pull back our support," one administration official says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FHA brings its own tough issues. The agency, which has insures private lenders against defaults on certain home mortgages, has seen its balance sheet take a hit as risky borrowers default on those loans and is already in danger of falling below a level of reserves mandated by Congress. Yet it remains a key facilitator of loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teri Gifford, who runs a mortgage brokerage serving Kentucky and Ohio, says 95% of her business involves getting clients loans backed by the FHA. "It's all government loans," says Ms. Gifford, whose firm, EZ Mortgage Loans Inc., Hillsboro, Ohio, brokers between $30 million and $35 million in loans each year. "That's all that can be done anymore."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gifford fears that the U.S. will pull back if the loans it's backing start going bad. "I'm worried what the future could hold if we put all the eggs in one basket," she said.</p>

</div><div>1675 words</div><div>12 September 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rules of personal finance are timeless: save, diversify, control costs and borrow prudently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the boom and subsequent bust, which reached its climax with the fall of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> and the near-meltdown of the global economy, those rules were forgotten. In the lows of the crisis the old rules emerged again, but with new twists brought on by the government's financial bailout and economic stimulus. They were spurred on by a new taste for thrift and a new understanding of risk among consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the changes will stick is unclear. Many Americans say they'll return to spending once things improve, and already some investors appear to have regained their taste for risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's a look at how the rules of personal finance have changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For conservative investors burned by supposedly "safe" investments, the credit crisis and slow-motion market crash hammered home one point: Everything carries some measure of risk, and even the stodgiest-seeming products require scrutiny.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the first cracks appeared among ultrashort bond funds, which many investors regarded as almost as safe as cash. Starting in late 2007, many of these funds hit the skids, thanks to mortgage-related securities and other complex holdings that dropped during the credit crunch. <span class="companylink">Schwab YieldPlus Fund</span>, for example, lost a a startling 35% in 2008, while Fidelity Ultra-Short Bond lost 8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for auction-rate securities froze up early last year, stranding investors who thought they were holding a cash-like vehicle. A big money-market fund "broke the buck" last September, sparking panic among investors who generally expect these funds to maintain a $1 share price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And target-date funds -- even those designed for investors on the brink of retirement -- dealt investors a blow as all their supposedly diversified holdings seemed to go down at once.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of these products have caught the attention of regulators, who have proposed tighter rules for money-market funds and examined target-date funds' strategies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such moves may make products marginally safer, but the burden remains on investors to know what they own, and to understand the risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a challenge for small investors, given that straight talk isn't a hallmark of fund prospectuses. Though target-date funds are aimed at investors seeking a simple, one-stop solution, for example, "disclosure is just terrible," says Laura Lutton, an editorial director at investment-research firm <span class="companylink">Morningstar Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's getting easier for investors to do their homework as financial advisers and analysts take a harder look at "safe" investments. Morningstar recently rolled out new ratings for target-date funds, analyzing the funds' holdings, fees, managers and other factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And with some people now asking about such issues as diversifying cash among multiple institutions, advisers say, investors are rethinking even their lowest-risk holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Eleanor Laise</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the recession and bailout have pushed this year's federal budget deficit to an unheard-of $1.6 trillion, an unpleasant reality has dawned: Taxes are going up. The only questions are when, how much, and for whom?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answers depend on the shifting sands of wealth politics and the scope of health-care revision. "But everybody thinks that by 2011 tax rates will be higher, at least for those with higher incomes," says Thomas Ochsenschlager, a tax official at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This certainty turns traditional tax-planning logic upside-down. Taxpayers have long been advised to defer taxes as long as possible, especially by making contributions to tax-sheltered IRAs and 401(k)s or holding assets for years in order to postpone realizing gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now taxpayers should reconsider this rule. The current top capital-gains rate of 15% on most assets is the lowest in living memory and the Obama administration has proposed raising it to 20%. Another proposal might tack on a 4.5% surtax for the wealthiest taxpayers. So it may make sense to realize long-term gains now, says Robert Gordon, who advises clients on sophisticated tax matters at <span class="companylink">Twenty-First Securities</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This strategy makes even more sense for those with unused capital losses from the past year's market maelstrom, because such losses can be used dollar-for-dollar to offset long-term gains. Otherwise capital losses can offset only $3,000 of ordinary income per year, although they may be carried forward indefinitely on federal returns and in some states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news here is that there are no rules that prohibit you from repurchasing an asset sold at a gain. So if you like a stock, you are free to buy it back right away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxpayers should also be rethinking deferrals of ordinary income, now taxed at nominal top rates of 35%. While it still makes sense to contribute to a retirement plan and reap an employer match, think twice about stuffing a plan without a match unless you have a long time horizon or your tax rates on withdrawal will be lower than they are now. (Mr. Gordon says some are also considering exercising appreciated stock options.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So great is the need for revenue that we've even seen a resurgence of talk about value-added tax, known as a VAT, though the resistance is fierce. It's unclear whether a VAT will gain traction, there's only one strategy for avoiding it: Buy now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Laura Saunders</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit Cards</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers have embraced the virtue of living within their means, but not always by choice. Banks have tightened credit, raised interest rates and fees on credit cards and increased bank fees to record levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes have angered millions of consumers, who have responded by paring back their use of credit. In the past week, for example, the Federal Reserve said revolving credit declined at an 8% annual rate, a move that shows Americans are ditching their plastic both by choice and by force as issuers continue to tighten up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Kevin Kapanowski of Detroit, the changes both spurred him to scale back his use of credit and made him read the firms' fine print more carefully. After Chase raised his monthly minimum payments earlier this year, the 37-year-old call-center project manager transferred his balance to another bank. "It's prompted me to examine more specifically what I'm getting from the company."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More people are also turning to cash or debit cards to curb their spending. Earlier this year, <span class="companylink">Visa Inc</span>. reported that the total dollar volume of purchases made using its branded debit cards surpassed credit-card purchases for the first time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, consumers are turning to credit unions and their local banks for help. Through March, loan growth at credit unions-including mortgages, small business and car loans and credit cards-rose 5.8%, compared with a decline of 2.9% for commercial banks, according to Bill Hampel, chief economist for the Credit Union National Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks, for their part, say they've limited lending in response to higher funding costs and consumer defaults. The new Credit Card Act, which limits banks' ability to reprice customers if they become riskier bets, is forcing banks to tighten up before the bulk of the law takes effect in February. Still, some banks are pulling through the financial crisis, thanks in part to the higher fees they're charging customers across credit cards and bank accounts, and are paying back funds borrowed under the Troubled Asset Relief Program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It used to be that banks' most profitable customers were those who carried balances every month, paid interest charges and occasional fees. Now, as banks back away from that potentially higher-risk group, they're looking at ways to encourage customers to charge more and purchase additional products and services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Jane J. Kim</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real Estate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's time to face facts, if you haven't already: sometimes your house is just a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most of the last decade, Americans treated their homes as sources of ready cash and as brick-and-mortar retirement plans. Overleveraged at purchase with no down payment, no documentation and negative-amortization mortgages, homeowners also mined equity with home-equity loans and lines of credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of the second quarter, about 23% of single-family homes with mortgages were "underwater," with owners owing more on their homes than they are worth, according to Zillow.com. And analysts for at least one major bank expect that share to rise as the housing market bottoms out in some areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures and short sales, where homes are sold for less than the debt outstanding on them, comprised 31% of total sales in July, according to the National Association of Realtors, helping depress prices for all. Buyers and sellers are at loggerheads in many markets, as home sellers refuse to accept the reality of lower prices. Depressed values and tighter credit in turn have reduced everyone's ability to borrow against their houses for remodeling, refurbishing, college tuition or other purposes. The lockup has caused people to feel poorer, even if they're employed and don't need to move. This feeling has, in a reversal of the boom's wealth effect, curbed consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the bust is giving plenty of first-time buyers, including the police officers, nurses and teachers who were priced out of some metro areas their first chance in years to own a home, helped by an $8,000 tax credit -- provided they can obtain a loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many other Americans have been forced to accept that they'll be living in their current place for a long while, even if they'd planned to flip or trade up. While sales of low-cost housing are picking up, for many, a house is back to what it traditionally was: a long-term financial commitment, a sturdy shelter and a place to hang your hat.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time home buyers are scrambling to qualify for a federal tax credit that expires Nov. 30 and has been driving up sales activity after the worst downturn in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the coming expiration will help show if the improvement will last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit, worth as much as $8,000, is available to first-time home buyers who close deals by Nov. 30. That means they have only a few more weeks to sign contracts because the closing process can be lengthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you're not in contract within the next 30 days, your chances are pretty slim," said Dan Rider, a broker with Dickson Realty in Reno, Nev. Some buyers are "getting twitchy" because of the approaching deadline and are putting in multiple offers to be sure one sticks, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several congressional proposals to expand and extend the credit have been introduced. But lawmakers are under pressure to show fiscal restraint after spending hundreds of billions of dollars to combat the recession and prop up the financial and automobile sectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists and housing analysts maintain that the credit sparked unneeded supply and drove sales higher partly by borrowing from future demand. Its absence could push the market back into the doldrums, with weakness stretching into next year, they warn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others say that without the Nov. 30 deadline, the current surge in sales activity will likely abate. "You have to have a deadline," said Christopher Thornberg, a principal with Beacon Economics, a Los Angeles-based research firm. "The fact that this program is ending is exactly what's necessary for the program to work."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government engineered the credit to salvage a market nearly paralyzed after home values plunged. For deals done between Jan. 1 and Nov. 30, first-time buyers -- defined as those who haven't owned a principal residence in the past three years -- can claim 10% of the home's purchase price, to as much as $8,000.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those interested in a Madoff lair, courtesy of the government, now have three to choose from.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bernard Madoff's two remaining federally seized properties, in New York and Palm Beach, Fla., were listed Thursday for $9.9 million and $8.5 million, respectively. His oceanfront home in Montauk, on New York's Long Island, was listed Sept. 1 for $8.75 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 4,000-square foot New York penthouse is a duplex on the 11th and 12th floors at 133 East 64th Street, a cooperative building less than three blocks from Central Park. It has three bedrooms, one of which was being used as a library, and open views of the city. The bedrooms are on the lower floor, and the living room, kitchen and a wraparound terrace are above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're just marketing it as an extraordinary New York penthouse property," said Anne Corey of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, who along with colleague Serena Boardman was chosen by the U.S. Marshals Service to list the property. "At the end of the day, that is what will be of interest to the next owner."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Corey said she has seen the penthouse twice and that her priority was to sell it quickly and to maximize the proceeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Money from the sale of the penthouse, along with the other residences, goes into a fund that will be used to reimburse the victims of Mr. Madoff's $65 billion Ponzi scheme. The listing agents are scheduled to begin showing the duplex Friday and already have taken appointments on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A competing broker who submitted a proposal and toured the penthouse recalled seeing personal items of the Madoffs around the home, including an electric shaver in a bathroom and identical white polo shirts lined up in a drawer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the Madoffs' personal items have been boxed up, Ms. Corey said Thursday, but the apartment will be shown furnished, and items such as artwork remain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Palm Beach, listing agents Jim McCann and Burt Minkoff, of <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>, are describing Mr. Madoff's mansion there as a "classic island home." The mansion, at 410 North Lake Way, is nearly 8,800 square feet and has five bedrooms and seven baths. The property has a pool, water views and deep-water dockage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McCann said he planned to begin showing the property Thursday night and that more than a dozen qualified buyers have expressed interest. The home, built in the early 1970s and renovated in the early '90s, has high, vaulted ceilings in the great-room area, and a covered loggia. "It's a blank slate ready for someone to decorate and enjoy," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the Montauk property, also Corcoran's, listing agent Joan Hegner said, through a spokesman, that four offers have been made on the 3,000-square-foot home. Also on Thursday, the Marshals Service said Mr. Madoff's three boats would be auctioned off in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on Nov. 17.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 71-year-old Mr. Madoff, mastermind of the biggest financial swindle in history, is serving a 150-year sentence in North Carolina. Prosecutors say he ran the scheme for at least 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, at a Senate Banking Committee hearing Thursday to discuss the SEC inspector general's report on the agency's bungling of the Madoff probe, SEC officials said they "deeply regret" having missed the fraud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is clear that no one can or should defend, excuse, or deflect responsibility for the SEC's handling of the Madoff matter," Robert Khuzami, the SEC's director of enforcement, and John Walsh, the acting director of the agency's examinations group, said in joint written testimony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SEC inspector general, David Kotz, whose 477-page report was made public Friday, said mistakes were made by junior and mid-level SEC managers. He said the SEC commission was "never informed" of the tips from Harry Markopolos, a Madoff rival who outlined numerous problems with Mr. Madoff's purported advisory business several times since 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.) called the report findings "ugly" and said his congressional committee will explore ways to compensate victims of the fraud.</p>

"The fact that this program is ending is exactly what's necessary for the program to work."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government engineered the credit to salvage a market nearly paralyzed after home values plunged. For deals done between Jan. 1 and Nov. 30, first-time buyers -- defined as those who haven't owned a principal residence in the past three years -- can claim 10% of the home's purchase price, to as much as $8,000. Single taxpayers making as much as $75,000 and married couples earning as much as $150,000 qualify for the full tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The credit clearly caught the attention of buyers. <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com chief economist Mark Zandi estimates the tax break will ultimately spur almost 400,000 additional new and existing sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales have surged for six straight months -- whittling down what had become a bloated inventory, particularly for cheaper homes. The number of units priced below $100,000 has dipped to a two-month supply in the West. A six-month supply is considered a healthy balance between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the deadline looming, builders and real-estate agents are trying to squeeze in as many deals as possible. They are urging buyers to schedule closings early, to ensure that last-minute problems don't push the closing into December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the permitting process and construction typically takes several months, many home builders are no longer guaranteeing new construction will be done in time to qualify. Buyers are being steered to homes already built or those near completion, known as specs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the sector curbed construction during the downturn, so supply is limited in some markets. "We haven't been able to keep up building as many spec homes as we intended because buyers are buying them more quickly than we can put them up," said Brent Anderson, vice president of investor relations for builder <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Veritas Homes Inc.'s Waterstone Crossing town-home development near Atlanta, 21 of 29 buyers this year tapped the credit for units starting at about $100,000, said Randall Moore, director of sales for the private Georgia-based builder.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. economy continued to stabilize in July and August, but soft consumer spending amid a weak job market suggested that recovery will remain subdued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Federal Reserve report Wednesday said retail sales in most regions in July and August were flat, despite a boost to auto sales from the government's "cash-for-clunkers" program, which granted consumers a government rebate when they traded in certain older vehicles for more fuel-efficient models. Still, each of the Fed's districts reported at least some signs of firming economic activity, with most indicating strengthening in residential real-estate markets as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's "beige book" report is a summary of economic activity prepared for use at the central bank's next Federal Open Market Committee meeting Sept. 22-23. The most recent report was prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and reflects information gathered between mid-July and late August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its previous beige book report, published July 29, the Fed said most regions across the country were seeing signs the recession was easing. Most indicated the pace of decline had moderated in late spring and early summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest beige book said, "Reports from the 12 Federal Reserve Districts indicate that economic activity continued to stabilize in July and August." It said consumer spending remained soft in most districts. But a majority of the 12 districts said the "cash for clunkers" program elevated traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending drives much of the economy. People are afraid to spend much because they have lost or are afraid of losing their jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Labor-market conditions remained weak across all districts, but several also noted an uptick in temporary hiring and a decline in the pace of layoffs," the beige book report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential real-estate markets remained weak, but there were signs of improvement. Downward pressure on home prices continued in most areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for commercial real estate, demand for space remained weak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On banking, the beige book said many districts reported credit standards were tight. Loan demand was described as weak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most districts reported improvements in manufacturing production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The long recession has tempered inflation. Wage pressures remained minimal across all districts. Consumer prices were described as steady in most areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports on agriculture were mixed. Weather conditions were described as favorable in the districts of St. Louis, Kansas City, and Atlanta. But cold weather, crop diseases and drought were limiting production of corn, cotton and soybeans in the Chicago, Minneapolis and Dallas districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlanta, Dallas, Kansas City and San Francisco regions noted increased oil and gas inventories as a result of reduced consumption. Cleveland indicated weak demand for electricity prompted coal producers to scale back production and capital investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are summaries from each of the Fed districts:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boston: Activity remains below its level a year ago. However business confidence about economic recovery is rising. Staffing firms are reporting a rise in activity while fewer companies are planning layoffs. The Fed's contacts report that "consumers still seem to be cautious in their spending and focused on getting the best value for their dollar." Some contacts indicated to the Fed their belief that this will be the "new norm" among consumers as a long, drawn-out economic recovery takes hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York: The economy here appears stable, and the labor market -- while soft -- is showing signs of "gradual improvement." Retail sales are sluggish, and tourism activity is steady despite a significant falloff in business travel. Meanwhile, bankers are reporting rising delinquency rates across all categories of loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philadelphia: This area is showing a "few scattered signs of improvement." Manufacturers are reporting a slight increase in new orders, and existing home sales are holding steady, albeit at lower levels than a year ago. Still, the economic outlook appears to be improving. "Although most contacts do not expect strong improvement in the immediate future, some now believe economic conditions are beginning to stabilize and that a slow pickup in activity might get under way in the near term," the report notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cleveland: Economic activity here, while improving slightly, remains sluggish. New home construction is weak and credit remains tight for residential and commercial contractors. Sales are down along with freight transport volumes, commercial and industrial loan activity and coal production. In a somewhat positive note, job openings were flat to up slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richmond: The economy here remains weak, but signs of improvement are apparent in some sectors. Falling home prices are driving up sales of low- and midpriced houses, manufacturing employment has stabilized and revenue is slowly climbing at some services firms. Still, demand for commercial loans is subdued, commercial real estate conditions are softening and vacancy rates are rising. Employment and wages are contracting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta: The "cash for clunkers" program drove up auto sales here as it did in many other districts. The pace of the decline in home sales continued moderating even as inventory of unsold homes remains high. The pace of layoffs has slowed, but few companies are planning hiring binges in the near future. Businesses report no plans to "hike prices or raise wages in the current environment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chicago: Economic activity here "leveled off" in July and August, with most Fed contacts agreeing that activity had stabilized at a low level. The Fed's contacts report cautious optimism for recovery through the remainder of 2009. Consumer spending is up while the decline in business spending has slowed. The pace of job losses has slowed, but "firms remained cost-conscious, limiting spending and hiring." Still, some Fed contacts clearly have recovery on the mind, reporting "reservations about how quickly they could increase production when conditions warranted given the degree to which they had cut back on workforces."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">St. Louis: While economic activity here is weak, the pace of economic declines appears to be moderating. Manufacturing and services activity contracted at a slow place. Still, real estate markets are weak, lending activity was down and retail and auto sales remain well below year-ago levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minneapolis: Things are looking up in manufacturing, energy, mining and residential real estate, but labor markets remain mixed and consumer spending and commercial real estate and construction activity is down. Architects continue reporting low activity levels and said customers continue bargaining for lower fees. Professional services companies supporting health care and the government reported an up tick in business activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kansas City: The economic picture here looks bleak even as conditions held steady. Commercial real estate is described as "fragile," banking conditions as "tepid," and few firms are planning to hire new workers. Falling grain prices and weak livestock exports are depressing agricultural profits, and despite increases in costs for materials, few producers believe they'll be able to pass those increases along in the form of higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dallas: The economy here appears "less gloomy" than it once did, but the Fed's contacts aren't hailing a strong economic turnaround quite yet. "Several contacts expressed disappointment that conditions had not improved more," the Fed noted. Still, employment levels appear steady, staffing firms are reporting growth in demand for their services and crude oil prices are stronger. Government stimulus programs also aren't yet having the desired effect here. "There has been a sluggish start to the 'shovel-ready' projects covered under the stimulus plan, and funding has been slow to materialize," the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco: Economic activity here is showing only "scattered signs of firming." Retail sales are described as "anemic" while demand for services continues to drop. Manufacturing activity appears "stuck" at very low levels, and credit quality continued to deteriorate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's $300 billion sovereign-wealth fund is eyeing big investments in distressed U.S. real estate, according to people familiar with the matter. To finance some of the deals, China may rely on an old trading partner: the U.S. government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, officials from <span class="companylink">China Investment Corp</span>. have held talks with U.S. private-equity fund managers, including <span class="companylink">BlackRock Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Invesco Ltd</span>. and <span class="companylink">Lone Star Funds</span>, about potential investments in beaten-down property assets, namely mortgage securities backed by office buildings, hotels, strip malls and other commercial property. CIC also is considering buying ownership interests in buildings, according to the people with knowledge of the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, CIC is weighing investing through one of the U.S. government's bailout programs, the Treasury's Public-Private Investment Program, known as PPIP. The program is designed to rid banks of toxic mortgage securities by enticing investors to buy these assets with financing from the U.S. government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representatives for CIC, BlackRock, Invesco and Lone Star declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discussions come at a time when CIC, which had nearly $300 billion in assets at the end of last year, is moving to deploy its capital after a relatively idle 2008. Property markets world-wide have plunged since the credit-market crisis that started in mid-2007, creating opportunities for cash-rich buyers. In the U.S., commercial property values already have dropped 35% from the peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, CIC deployed just $4.8 billion in global financial markets. This year it invested that much in a single month, CIC Chairman Lou Jiwei said last month. He said that if CIC's future returns are good enough, it might ask the government to let it invest more of China's foreign-exchange reserves, which now total $2.132 trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unclear how much CIC intends to allocate to U.S. real estate. But in order to achieve any meaningful diversification in its portfolio, the fund would need to set aside between $4 billion and $10 billion to global property investments in the next year and a half, estimates Michael McCormack, an executive director at Z-Ben Advisors, a consulting firm in Shanghai. By 2014, he projects that CIC's U.S. property investments alone could amount to more than $20 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. property market is appealing to the Chinese partly because of the financing being offered through the PPIP program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the program, the Treasury will co-invest with funds that buy toxic mortgages that have been clogging banks' balance sheets. The U.S. government, through the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, also will make financing available to the ventures. In other words, CIC and the Treasury would be partners in borrowing money from the U.S. government to buy troubled mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury, which plans to allocate as much as $30 billion to PPIP, has designated nine fund managers, including BlackRock and Invesco, to raise at least $500 million of private capital each by the end of September. The Treasury then will provide equity capital up to 100% of the private capital raised by the fund managers. The fund-raising efforts are off to a relatively slow start, as many investors remain wary of the red tape associated with investing in a government-sponsored program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The possibility of a sovereign-wealth fund investing through PPIP was envisioned in the program's design. It limits investments by any single investor to no more than 9.9% of each PPIP fund. The cap was intended to assuage any concerns that any one investor, like China, could control too much, according to government officials. A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, CIC and other sovereign-wealth funds face some obstacles to investing in U.S. real estate. Economic distress has raised the ire on Capitol Hill, with some lawmakers pointing the finger at China. They claim that heavy purchases of U.S. government bonds by the Chinese helped inflate the credit bubble by keeping interest rates low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elected officials have for decades been concerned about foreign investment in U.S. real estate. In the early 1980s, Congress approved a tax on capital gains from foreign sales of U.S. property. That tax, however, didn't stop Japanese investors in the 1980s from investing about $77 billion in the U.S. property markets, buying such assets as Rockefeller Center in New York and the Pebble Beach golf course in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CIC is unlikely to replicate those investments. It has consistently taken minority stakes, often below 10%, in part to defuse political risk. CIC's "debut in the U.S. property market likely will be double arm's-length investments," meaning through U.S. fund managers, with a minority stake in the fund, as opposed to direct stakes in actual properties, Mr. McCormack said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the woes in the U.S. marketplace might work in the favor of foreign investors like CIC. U.S. real-estate executives are lobbying to amend tax law to encourage overseas capital to flow into U.S. real estate, thus helping prevent a further decline in commercial-property values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Simple reforms could be made that would help address the equity shortfall our markets need to recover," said Jeffrey Deboer, president of Real Estate Roundtable, a trade group that is spearheading the lobbying efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CIC's foray into international markets, including its stakes in Blackstone Group LP and <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, has been marked with big losses, at least on paper. But it recently has signaled a willingness to reopen the purse, selecting both firms to help oversee new investments in hedge funds. Also this year, it bought stakes in China-focused alternative asset-management firm Citic Capital Holdings Ltd. and U.S. asset manager BlackRock and has been in discussions about allocating billions more to hedge funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It recently made an investment in <span class="companylink">Goodman Group</span>, a real-estate trust in Australia, and bought a stake in <span class="companylink">Songbird Estates PLC</span>, the majority shareholder of <span class="companylink">Canary Wharf Group</span>, an owner and developer of office towers and retail stores in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, CIC has committed about $800 million to a <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> global property fund, which intends to raise more than $5 billion and invests in real estate world-wide, according to a person familiar with the matter. A <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>

By 2014, he projects that CIC's U.S. property investments alone could amount to more than $20 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. property market is appealing to the Chinese partly because of the financing being offered through the PPIP program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the program, the Treasury will co-invest with funds that buy toxic mortgages that have been clogging banks' balance sheets. The U.S. government, through the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, also will make financing available to the ventures. In other words, CIC and the Treasury would be partners in borrowing money from the U.S. government to buy troubled mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury, which plans to allocate as much as $30 billion to PPIP, has designated nine fund managers, including BlackRock and Invesco, to raise at least $500 million of private capital each by the end of September. The Treasury then will provide equity capital up to 100% of the private capital raised by the fund managers. The fund-raising efforts are off to a relatively slow start, as many investors remain wary of the red tape associated with investing in a government-sponsored program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The possibility of a sovereign-wealth fund investing through PPIP was envisioned in the program's design. It limits investments by any single investor to no more than 9.9% of each PPIP fund. The cap was intended to assuage any concerns that any one investor, like China, could control too much, according to government officials. A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, CIC and other sovereign-wealth funds face some obstacles to investing in U.S. real estate. Economic distress has raised the ire on Capitol Hill, with some lawmakers pointing the finger at China. They claim that heavy purchases of U.S. government bonds by the Chinese helped inflate the credit bubble by keeping interest rates low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elected officials have for decades been concerned about foreign investment in U.S. real estate. In the early 1980s, Congress approved a tax on capital gains from foreign sales of U.S. property. That tax, however, didn't stop Japanese investors in the 1980s from investing about $77 billion in the U.S. property markets, buying such assets as Rockefeller Center in New York and the Pebble Beach golf course in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CIC is unlikely to replicate those investments. It has consistently taken minority stakes, often below 10%, in part to defuse political risk. CIC's "debut in the U.S. property market likely will be double arm's-length investments," meaning through U.S. fund managers, with a minority stake in the fund, as opposed to direct stakes in actual properties, Mr. McCormack said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the woes in the U.S. marketplace might work in the favor of foreign investors like CIC. U.S. real-estate executives are lobbying to amend tax law to encourage overseas capital to flow into U.S. real estate, thus helping prevent a further decline in commercial-property values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Simple reforms could be made that would help address the equity shortfall our markets need to recover," said Jeffrey Deboer, president of Real Estate Roundtable, a trade group that is spearheading the lobbying efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CIC's foray into international markets, including its stakes in <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> and <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, has been marked with big losses, at least on paper. But it recently has signaled a willingness to reopen the purse, selecting both firms to help oversee new investments in hedge funds. Also this year, it bought stakes in China-focused alternative asset-management firm Citic Capital Holdings Ltd. and U.S. asset manager BlackRock and has been in discussions about allocating billions more to hedge funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It recently made an investment in <span class="companylink">Goodman Group</span>, a real-estate trust in Australia, and bought a stake in <span class="companylink">Songbird Estates PLC</span>, the majority shareholder of <span class="companylink">Canary Wharf Group</span>, an owner and developer of office towers and retail stores in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, CIC has committed about $800 million to a <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> global property fund, which intends to raise more than $5 billion and invests in real estate world-wide, according to a person familiar with the matter. A <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market was unified by the bust. After peaking in 2006, home prices across the country joined the march downward. Are investors prepared for a return to more normal times?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't long ago that a nationwide price decline was considered almost impossible by many, not having been observed since the Great Depression. Supply and demand have usually dictated prices on a local level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet, now that there are signs of stabilization, some investors appear to be hoping for prices to recover across the board. Better housing data, such as a rise in the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index have helped stocks extend a heady rally. A one-time government tax deduction for first time buyers and seasonal demand for homes have added a timely boost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a look on a regional level shows a different story. The likes of overbuilt Las Vegas and Miami have yet to see prices turn. There, distressed sales now make up around two-thirds of transactions, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such distressed sales, mainly foreclosures, are discounted on average 15% to 20%, dragging overall prices lower. Granted, that may set the stage for higher prices when foreclosures slow, but there still is little sign that inventory is near equilibrium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the face of it, other parts of the country appear to have better traction. Take the Midwest. Cleveland saw prices rise 10% in the three months through June, the fastest of any location in S&amp;P/Case Shiller's 20-city index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midwestern states will likely face some hiccups in any recovery. The NAR reckons the Midwest still has 8.0 months' supply of single-family homes on the market between $100,000 and $250,000, compared with 8.9 months a year ago. During the 1990s, the average nationwide was 6.6 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That supply could be tough to clear. The many buyers underwater on existing homes will struggle to move, even to a cheaper home. In Ohio, for instance, some 39% of mortgages have negative equity, or are attached to properties worth less than outstanding debt, according to research firm First American CoreLogic. The national average is 32%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand may stay especially weak for homes in high price categories. The NAR says just 2.5% of the 460,000 homes sold in July cost $500,000 or more. In the fourth quarter of 2004, such homes accounted for 11.2% of the total.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That presents potential for higher average sales prices if more high-end sales are completed. But, with "jumbo" mortgages harder to come by, demand is likely to remain concentrated at lower price levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, stability in some housing markets is refreshing. But after the summer house-hunting season ends, the sum of a fragmented market is unlikely to be a unified rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overheard</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's trading in Blockbuster was worthy of the video chain's name. After the company disclosed some hopeful news about its financial position, the shares rocketed 32% to the princely sum of $1.20. More impressive was the trading volume: 31.3 million of the more-plentiful "A" shares, or about 10 times the average. Indeed, trading has been unusually heavy since the start of last week. Including Wednesday, 74.9 million A shares have been traded, 61% of those outstanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blockbuster's big shareholders include, of course, Carl Icahn, although there isn't any indication he is among the sellers. He has, however, recently lightened his stake in <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span>, unloading 12.7 million or nearly 17% of his stake for a little below $15 a share. Based on previous disclosures suggesting an average cost on his <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> stake of $23.59 a share, Mr. Icahn likely lost $110 million on the trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not exactly a blockbuster outcome.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With housing prices still in the dumps, many Americans are finding themselves in the uncomfortable position of landlord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some have been forced to relocate for a job and can't sell their houses. Others have moved, but are holding on to their previous homes, hoping for prices to rebound before selling. Many are finding that rent checks don't come close to covering their mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hard data are scant on how many homeowners are renting out their homes, but anecdotal evidence suggests numbers are up. In one indication of the trend: More homeowners are converting their homeowners insurance to landlord policies that cover the additional risks of leasing out a home. <span class="companylink">Allstate Corp</span>., the second largest home insurer in the U.S., reported a 27% increase in conversions in the first quarter from the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The number of rental homes available is greater today than it was a year ago due to the foreclosure crisis," says Mike Nelson, current president of Rental Home Professionals Inc., a multiple listing service of rental homes owned by the National Association of Residential Property Managers in Chesapeake, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Frederick, Md., Realtor Jim Bass says that because of rising demand, a couple of months ago his real-estate group started offering property-management services, tending to the rented homes of absent owners. Mr. Bass says a client recently rented out his 4,700-square-foot house after failing to sell his home, which he listed for $790,000. Now a tenant pays $2,995 per month -- a shortfall of $2,000 from the $4,995 mortgage payment. The homeowner "feels that two years from now, the market will improve to the point where he can recapture that," Mr. Bass says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts generally advise against becoming a landlord in hopes of recouping lost home value. In some hard-hit parts of the country, such as Florida, Nevada, Arizona and parts of Ohio, prices may not climb back to mid-2000s levels anytime soon. Landlords have to pony up money each year for property taxes, insurance, maintenance and repairs. Meanwhile, demand for rentals in many parts of the U.S. isn't strong: Apartment vacancy rates nationally are the highest in more than two decades and rents are falling in some areas, compounding the difficulty of finding a good, steady tenant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners who owe more than a house is worth in very depressed areas may be better off selling even in a short sale, whereby the bank agrees to accept less than the full amount owed on the mortgage, says economist Edward Leamer, director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast. Your credit rating takes a serious hit, but, he says, "better to take your losses and move on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kyle Becker, 27 years old, and his wife didn't feel they had much of a choice in becoming landlords. The couple and their infant son moved from Columbia, Mo., to Winchester, Va., last year so that Mr. Becker could attend pharmacy school at Shenandoah University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before they moved, they listed their three bedroom, two-bath ranch-style home in May 2008 for $139,000. They had bought it in 2005 for $110,000 and put $30,000 into roofing and siding. By February, they hadn't received a single bid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had only seven lookers over the course of a year," Mr. Becker says. Meanwhile, the couple was paying $1,200 a month in rent for a Virginia house. Last spring, the Beckers finally leased the Missouri house for $675 a month -- $225 less than their mortgage payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the home was no longer owner-occupied, Mr. Becker was unable to refinance his 6.1% mortgage when 30-year rates dipped below 5% briefly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If he had to do it all over again, Mr. Becker says, he might have chopped the price of his Missouri house, where sales have been stagnant -- with the exception of "distressed" properties in some stage of default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The calculation isn't the same for all homeowners. Those who have paid off their home or have a small mortgage balance may be able to wait out the market. And there are pockets of the country -- Houston is one -- where home prices haven't fallen as hard. Some homeowners may want rental income to supplement retirement savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, they may be shocked by the costs. Teshika Holmes, 36, says she received no bids for her three-bedroom house in Huntsville, Ala., after a job loss forced her to relocate to Montgomery, Ala. She's renting it out for about $800 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Holmes hired a property manager who charges 10% of the rent. Typically rates run from 3% to 12%. She also pays an increased premium of $500 a year for landlord insurance. Among other things, a landlord policy covers the loss of rental income if a fire makes the house uninhabitable. It costs about 25% more than a standard homeowners policy, according to the Insurance Information Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Holmes says she has negative cash flow each month from her Huntsville house, but the rent allows her to stay current with her mortgage and preserve her good credit. "The only thing I wanted was the house note paid," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some homeowners are renting out their homes because they live in areas where a handful of distressed sales have skewed home prices downward. Economists say homeowners who have equity in such homes may be right to delay selling, as sales have started picking up. However, they should be realistic: Sales of lower and moderately priced homes are recovering faster than homes at the upper end, and prices may not rise that much in the short term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Richter, of Chicago suburb Wheaton, Ill., says he rented out his home because he was receiving low bids. "There were plenty of lowball bidders," says Mr. Richter who moved to a smaller home in Wheaton. "We have enough equity that we felt we were better off riding it out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before doing that, homeowners should consider the financial realties. Generally, utilities, maintenance and repairs run higher with tenants than when the owner occupies the house. Collecting enough rent to cover the note on a home purchased at the height of the housing boom may be impossible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rental income is taxable, but can be offset with business expenses--including mortgage interest, real-estate taxes and homeowners insurance--and depreciation. Expenses in excess of rental income also can be deducted, up to a limit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renting for an extended period can eliminate or diminish the value of capital-gains tax exclusions. Federal tax law requires you to live in the house at least two years of the previous five in order to qualify for the full capital-gains tax exclusion upon sale of $250,000 for a single person or $500,000 for a couple, with some exceptions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karen B. McIntyre, 46, a certified financial planner in Lower Gwynedd, Pa., a Philadelphia suburb, says she and her husband have been renting out their former home after they bought a newly built home nearby because of its better location and excellent price. "We may also lose some of the capital gain exclusion, but expect the increased selling price (of the older home) will make up for the decrease in capital gain exclusion."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Christina S.N. Lewis </div><div>1072 words</div><div>3 September 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>32</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Mexican real-estate family's move into the U.S. has led to problems that could ripple throughout their empire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cababie family, of Mexico's well-known Grupo Gicsa development company, is potentially on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars as a result of personal guarantees they made on loans used to finance two major U.S. real-estate investments, according to court documents and people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the family's largest U.S. project, an 850-unit condominium in downtown Miami called Everglades on the Bay, entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the same day a foreclosure action was launched. Struggling in one of the worst condo markets in decades, the project defaulted in March on a $256 million construction loan from a group led by <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. that was guaranteed by Gicsa and in part the family, according to foreclosure documents filed in Florida state court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Cababies personally guaranteed $300 million in loan payments to finance the $1.5 billion purchase in 2007 of 56 office buildings in Southern California from Arden Realty, a unit of <span class="companylink">General Electric Co</span>.'s <span class="companylink">GE Real Estate</span>. A Cababie entity surrendered that portfolio last year after it failed to make a loan payment, according to court documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for the family and Gicsa said in a statement that they are facing challenges similar to other developers in the "unprecedented downturn in the real-estate market." But they are confident that they have the experience and properties to "weather the storm," the statement said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal guarantees can cause problems for real-estate developers because they give creditors enormous power to go after all of their assets in the case of a default. During the real-estate collapse of the early 1990s, personal guarantees helped create huge financial problems for Donald Trump and took down scores of others, including William Zeckendorf Jr.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People close to the family downplayed the immediate danger the guarantees posed to the rest of the family's real-estate empire because the unsold condominiums at the Everglades project may end up being worth close to the balance of the construction loan. Meanwhile, the $300 million Arden-related guarantees are being litigated in California state court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But only 86 of the Everglades' 850 units have been sold, and the value of the others has fallen with the decline of the Miami condo market, say real-estate brokers. <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> said in court papers that the value of the project is worth "multiple millions of dollars" less than the loan's $209 million balance and that the developer has little chance of emerging from bankruptcy. The developer disputes this, pointing out that an appraisal from this spring valued the property at $205 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, creditors in the Arden case contend the guarantees that the family made when it bought the Southern California portfolio are enforceable now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenges facing the two Cababie brothers, Abraham and Elias, include poor timing, high leverage and the death of their brother, Jacobo, who led their U.S. operations and died last year of a heart attack at age 39, according to press accounts. The family said in a statement Tuesday that Jacobo Cababie's death hasn't negatively impacted the success of the companies he was overseeing. Besides the Everglades and the California office-building investments, the family also developed other projects in South Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The closely held Gicsa was founded in 1989. It grew explosively and is among the largest and most-recognized developers in Mexico's fragmented real-estate industry. Its developments include the <span class="companylink">MetLife</span> building in Lomas de Chapultepec and the La Isla Cancun, a shopping center located on an artificial Caribbean island with an internal canal, an aquarium, a movie theater and a marina.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, the three brothers' net worth was valued at about $1.2 billion, mainly in real estate, according to a person who reviewed their statement of financial condition. But since then, real-estate values throughout the world have plummeted. The company declined to comment on personal information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cababies' U.S. operations began about seven years ago. In 2003, the developer launched the Everglades condo, which has three swimming pools. Initially it was well-received and presold 93% of its units, according to the developer. But by the time it opened last year, buyers refused to pay prebust prices and canceled in droves, according to the project's bankruptcy filing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marc Kasowitz, of Kasowitz, Benson, Torres &amp;Friedman, an attorney representing the Everglades, claims the condos would have been able to sell if prices were cut as the market fell. But he said <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> refused to allow them to lower the minimum sales price. Prices in the building had been more than $400 a square foot, while area units have traded recently between $200 and $300 a square foot, according to South Florida firm Condo Vultures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> declined to comment. But in court papers, it disputed many of the developer's claims and said it plans to file a motion to dismiss the developer's Chapter 11 case, saying the filing was "unplanned and ill-conceived."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as Florida's condo market turned, the Cababie family continued to expand. In 2007, it led a group that paid $1.5 billion for the Arden portfolio in Southern California. The deal was financed by a $1.35 billion loan from <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> that was later syndicated. The deal required two $150 million loan payments, in 2008 and 2009, which the brothers and a fourth investor personally guaranteed, according to court records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the group defaulted on the first $150 million payment and relinquished control to Hines, a Houston-based private real-estate firm that had purchased a portion of the debt. The family later went to court to block creditors from enforcing the personal guarantee, according to court documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the fate of the Everglades project may rest in the hands of the courts. Part of the dispute is over the extent of the personal guarantee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> claims in court documents that half of the $209 million outstanding loan balance is guaranteed. The Cababie side is claiming it is only 25%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James B. Stewart SmartMoney </div><div>749 words</div><div>2 September 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Passing through the Fort Myers, Fla., airport a few weeks ago, I noticed people eagerly signing up for a free bus tour of foreclosed real estate -- with all properties offering water views. During the ride to my hotel, the young driver volunteered that he had just bought his first house, paying $65,000 for a foreclosed property in nearby Cape Coral that last sold for over $250,000. He said he had never expected to be able to buy anything on a driver's salary, let alone something that nice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> reported that its S&amp;P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price index of real-estate values increased this past quarter over the first quarter of 2009, the first quarter-on-quarter increase in three years. Its index of 20 major cities also rose for the three months ended June 30 over the three months ended May 31, with only hard-hit Detroit and Las Vegas experiencing declines. The week before that, the National Association of Realtors reported that sales volume of existing homes was up 7.2% in July from June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, the data suggest that real-estate prices hit a bottom some time during the second quarter, and have now begun to rise. There's no way to be certain that this marks the end of the long, painful correction that followed the real-estate bubble, but clearly prices are no longer in free-fall. That means if you've been sitting on the fence, it's time to act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ordinarily I'd never try to time the real-estate market, but I can understand why buyers have been cautious. Few want to buy in down markets, just as stock buyers avoid bear markets. And for most people, of course, buying a house is a much bigger decision than buying a stock. But with real-estate prices nationally now down about 30% from their 2006 peak and showing signs of turning up, the prices aren't likely to go much lower. Every real-estate market is local, and so there may be a few exceptions. Overall, though, I can't imagine a better time to buy than now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to bargain prices, buyers also should find plenty of homes to choose from. The inventory of unsold homes was 4.09 million units in July, up 7.3% from June, according to the National Association of Realtors. And mortgage rates this week were at a two-month low of close to 5%, according to Zillow. Even the stricter appraisal process is working to the advantage of buyers. Appraisals are coming in far lower than most sellers have been expecting, forcing them to face the new reality of sharply lower prices. And with stricter standards, lenders aren't going to let buyers borrow more than they can afford, which protects buyers and helps to keep prices down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless you're really prepared to accept the demands (and headaches) of being a landlord, I don't recommend direct ownership of real estate as an investment. The days of buyers lining up to flip Miami Beach and Las Vegas condos are mercifully gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are much easier ways to make money in real estate, such as real-estate investment trusts or buying shares in home builders and other housing-related businesses (such as <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>). Historically, the mean rate of return on real estate has been around 3%, according to research from Yale economist Robert Shiller, who co-developed the Case-Shiller index. Shares in REITs and other stocks have often done much better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's a good reason homeownership has been such a central part of the American dream. It delivers security, pride of ownership, a sense of community and decent investment returns as a bonus. I felt glad for my driver in Florida. He represents the other side of the foreclosure crisis. For every hardship story, and no doubt there are many, others are realizing their dreams of home ownership and getting what may well turn out to be the deals of their lives.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi </div><div>822 words</div><div>2 September 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Africa Israel Investments Ltd</span>., a beleaguered Israeli real-estate company, has cut the price of a Miami parcel of land by more than half so it could complete its sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A group affiliated with Africa Israel agreed in 2006 to sell the seven-acre parcel in 2006 for about $88.7 million to a partnership led by Falcone Group of Boca Raton, Fla. But the deal never closed as the recession deepened and property values tumbled. Now, to end three years of wrangling, Africa Israel has agreed to reduce the price to about $39 million. The deal is expected to close later this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal reflects, in part, the pressure that Africa Israel has been under to raise cash. Led by Lev Leviev, an Israeli diamond merchant, the company is best known for its top-of-the-market purchase of the old New York Times building and the troubled Apthorp condominium-conversion development on Manhattan's Upper West Side. The company is selling some real-estate assets to pay off debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the buyers also were under pressure to compromise. The group led by Falcone, a real-estate company owned by three brothers, had already sunk $18 million into the deal from the original deposit along with increases paid to keep extending the closing. In 2007, the Falcone-affiliated group, known as 150 NE 7th Street LLC, filed a lawsuit in a Florida circuit court and sought to recover its deposit money. But Africa Israel battled back. In an amended complaint filed earlier this year, the buyers alleged that the seller didn't meet certain conditions of sale, including failing to remove defects in the property's title in a "timely basis."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Art Falcone, Falcone Group's chief executive, described the price cut as a "settlement."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the transaction closes as expected, it will be one of only a handful of larger commercial land sales this year. From January through July, the total value of sales of vacant land entitled for commercial development in the U.S. fell to about $636 million, from $5.5 billion in the year-earlier period, according to data from <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span> based on a survey of transactions valued at $5 million or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline comes as some lenders, already skittish about financing any real-estate purchases in the recession, are just saying no to borrowers seeking loans on acquisitions of vacant land and empty buildings with no hope of near-term income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Lenders are avoiding properties without income like the plague," says Dan Fasulo, managing director of <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new price comprises the $18 million that Falcone has put in so far, $17.5 million in additional cash and a $3.5 million loan from the seller due in two years, Mr. Falcone says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The parcel is one of a number of properties totaling about 25 acres slated to be redeveloped into a mixed-use project dubbed Miami Worldcenter. It would turn a bleak stretch of the city's Park West section, now dotted with parking lots, into a roughly 12 million-square-foot walkable "city within a city" designed by Elkus Manfredi Architects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falcone Group, Marc Roberts Cos. and Centurion Partners are listed as the project's developers on its Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Falcone says he is committed to the project's long-term vision but estimates it could be several years before the credit markets and demand for new real estate rebound from their current slump and enable the group to begin developing the project. "We'll wait it out," Mr. Falcone says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The settlement between Falcone and Africa Israel was welcomed by some as a sign that the Miami Worldcenter project still has a chance of being realized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marc Sarnoff, a Miami commissioner who hopes that a convention center might eventually be included in the Miami Worldcenter plans, says Miami has seen a number of developers walk away from agreements to buy land for projects that were conceived before the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sarnoff is hopeful that the parcel's lower price might ultimately make the Miami Worldcenter development more affordable. "As much as we don't want to see values go down, it could be a good thing," Mr. Sarnoff says. "Having a high basis in your property means you have to charge high rents."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Africa Israel and a partner had planned to develop a condominium or mixed-use project on the Miami site, according to a person familiar with the transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in New York, the owners of the famed Apthorp, which include Africa Israel USA and Feil Organization, a developer, recently reduced the prices on some condo units by as much as 50% in an effort to sell more units and keep the building from going back to being a rental.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Tamara Audi and Peter Sanders </div><div>559 words</div><div>1 September 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES -- Another day of scorching heat and low humidity helped the massive wildfire north of here burn through thousands of additional acres on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Firefighters scrambled on multiple flanks to protect houses as well as a mountaintop communications complex that is home to the historic Mt. Wilson Observatory and most of the transmitters for the city's television and radio stations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This fire is growing by leaps and bounds," said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. So far, 4,300 homes in Los Angeles County have been evacuated as a result of the fire, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By midday Monday, as crews continued to battle the blaze, the so-called Station fire had burned more than 100,000 acres and stretched 20 miles from east to west.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first mandatory evacuations within the Los Angeles city limits went into effect Monday as the fire closed in on the city's northern neighborhoods. Fire officials estimated that more than 12,000 structures were threatened by fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday night, authorities revised a midday report that five people were trapped in a canyon near Gold Creek. They said five men and one woman refused several orders to evacuate the remote ranch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When we tried to get them out, they said they're fine, no problem, they didn't want to leave," said fire spokesman Larry Marinas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday afternoon, two veteran Los Angeles County firefighters were killed in an accident after their truck rolled off the road during the firefight. The deaths are under investigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since it began Wednesday -- at the outset of a heat wave that hit the region -- the fire has burned at least 53 homes, which include some forest cabins, the U.S. Forest Service said Monday. Three civilians who defied an evacuation order on Saturday as they attempted to defend their homes suffered serious burns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dense plume of white smoke hung high over Los Angeles on Monday. Gray smoke seeped into neighborhoods in the San Fernando valley just beyond the Hollywood Hills, and residents nearest the smoke were warned not to take part in strenuous outdoor activities because of poor air quality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fire officials said that so far, the summer fire season has been a routine one for California. Aside from the Station fire, seven other fires burned around the state Monday. Many of those were close to containment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the proximity of the Station blaze to the Los Angeles metropolitan area, and its stubborn resistance to firefighters, set it apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a pretty significant fire, but not an unheard-of fire," said Jason Kirchner, a spokesman for the Forest Service. "It's threatening a lot of homes and it's right on the northern edge of the Los Angeles basin, which adds a unique nature to this fire."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fire officials had hoped to contain the fire by Sept. 8, but pushed that date back until at least Sept. 12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What's really driving this is steep terrain, dense vegetation and the weather," Mr. Kirchner said. "It's hot and dry and really miserable conditions. We just can't seem to catch a break."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael S. Derby   </div><div>1188 words</div><div>1 September 2009</div><div>13:26</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. factories saw output rise for the first time since January 2008 in August, in another sign the recession is coming to an end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, construction spending in the U.S. unexpectedly fell during July, dragged down a big drop in the commercial sector that offset strength in the housing industry. However, a forecasting gauge of home sales rose more than expected in July in another round of good news for the U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management reported that its manufacturing index for last month came in at 52.9, from 48.9 in July and 44.8 in June. Numbers over 50 indicate growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">August's reading were over the 50.9 that economists had expected to see. August matches the reading seen in June 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing sector has for much of this year been on a steady path toward growth. The slow recovery of this hard-hit arena has buoyed confidence the rest of the economy is emerging from the worst recession of the post-war period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The year-and-a-half decline in manufacturing output has come to an end, as 11 of 18 manufacturing industries are reporting growth," said Norbert Ore, who directs the survey. "The growth appears sustainable in the short term, as inventories have been reduced for 40 consecutive months and supply chains will have to re-stock to meet this new demand," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The details of the ISM report were generally positive. The private research group reported that its new orders index, a leading indicator of future activity, moved to 64.9 in August from July's 55.3, while the production index hit 61.9 from 57.9. The inventories index was 34.4, from 33.5 in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hiring remained a bleak spot, with ongoing contraction. The employment index stood at 46.4, after July's 45.6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, inflation heated up, with the prices index at 65.0. The measure stood at 55.0 a month before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction Spending Declines</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total construction spending decreased by 0.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $958.04 billion compared to the prior month, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street had expected spending would increase, by 0.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall construction spending rose 0.1% in June; originally, June spending was seen 0.3% higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year over year, spending in July was down 10.5% since July 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending in July on residential construction projects soared 2.3% to $254.2 billion. Residential spending fell 0.3% in May, a revision from the originally reported increase of 0.7% for the month. Year over year, residential spending was 26.9% below the July 2008 level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market seems to be recovering as the economy tries turning around following the worst recession since World War II. Groundbreakings on single-family homes have gone up five straight times. New-home sales have climbed five in the latest seven months as buyers help themselves to low interest rates, a federal tax credit, and bargain prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As housing picks up, commercial construction is sliding. Tuesday's data showed non-residential construction spending decreased 1.0% during July, a broad-based decline that included falling outlays for hotels, schools, hospitals and roads. Year over year, spending for commercial construction was down 2.6%. Vacancy rates for office space have been rising and rents have fallen. Also, financing is difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending in the private sector during July increased by 0.1% to $630.4 billion. Spending fell 1.6% in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending in July by the government on construction dropped after five straight increases. While the recession has cost municipalities money, stimulus from Washington has buoyed spirits. Infrastructure spending tied to stimulus is seen down the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 0.7% drop in July public-sector construction spending, to $327.6 billion, followed a June surge of 3.6%. Federal government construction outlays climbed 0.8% in July. State and local spending, which is much larger than federal spending in dollars, decreased by 0.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending Home Sales Rise</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' index for pending sales of previously owned homes rose 3.2% to 97.6 from 94.6 in June, the industry group said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, the NAR pending sales index, based on signed contracts for previously owned homes, was 12% above the level of 87.1 a year earlier in July 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the index is at the highest level since June 2007, when it was 100.7. Also, the jump in sales marks the sixth straight climb in as many months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in contract activity for pending home sales is higher than expected. Private analysts projected pending sales would grow just 2% during July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data are yet another sign of a stabilizing housing market. In July, new-home sales rose for the fourth month in a row and existing-home sales hit a two year high on an annual basis during the month, according to government data. Additionally, the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index showed that home prices in major U.S. cities rose for the second straight month in June. These are all signs that while the housing market is still hurting, recovery is beginning to take hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The recovery is broad-based across many parts of the country," said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun in a statement. "Housing affordability has been at record highs this year with the added stimulus of a first-time buyer tax credit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its monthly forecast on the industry, the NAR projected existing-home sales at 5.24 million in 2010 and 4.97 million in 2009. That compares to 4.91 million in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for an existing home is seen at $178,200 in 2010 and $172,600 in 2009. It was $198,100 in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A month ago, the NAR forecast 2009 sales at 4.91 million and 2010 sales at 5.16 million. The 2009 median price was projected at $174,100 and the 2010 price at $179,800.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR's pending home sales index was designed to try to measure which way the housing market will go in the future. It is based on pending sales of existing homes, including single-family homes and condominiums. A home sale is pending when the contract has been signed but the transaction hasn't closed. Pending sales typically close within one or two months of signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, pending sales in the Northeast fell 3.0% in July from June; but they were up 4.7% since July 2008. Midwest activity fell 2.0% in July from June; it's up 8.1% since July 2008. Activity in the South grew 3.1% in July from June; it has grown 12.0% since July 2008. In the West pending sales rose 12.1% in July from June; they're up 20.0% since July 2008.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FEDERAL RESERVE and Treasury officials are scrambling to prevent the commercial-real-estate sector from delivering a roundhouse punch to the U.S. economy just as it struggles to get up off the mat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their efforts could be undermined by a surge in foreclosures of commercial property carrying mortgages that were packaged and sold by Wall Street as bonds. Similar mortgage-backed securities created out of home loans played a big role in undoing that sector and triggering the global economic recession. Now the $700 billion of commercial-mortgage-backed securities outstanding are being tested for the first time by a massive downturn, and the outcome so far hasn't been pretty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CMBS sector is suffering two kinds of pain, which, according to credit rater Realpoint, sent its delinquency rate to 3.14% in July, more than six times the level a year earlier. One is simply the result of bad underwriting. In the era of looser credit, Wall Street's CMBS machine lent owners money on the assumption that occupancy and rents of their office buildings, hotels, stores or other commercial property would keep rising. In fact, the opposite has happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other kind of hurt is coming from the inability of property owners to refinance loans bundled into CMBS when these loans mature. By the end of 2012, some $153 billion in loans that make up CMBS are coming due, and close to $100 billion of that will face difficulty getting refinanced, according to <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>. Even though the cash flows of these properties are enough to pay interest and principal on the debt, their values have fallen so far that borrowers won't be able to extend existing mortgages or replace them with new debt. That means losses not only to the property owners but also to those who bought CMBS -- including hedge funds, pension funds, mutual funds and other financial institutions -- thus exacerbating the economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A TYPICAL CMBS is stuffed with mortgages on a diverse group of properties, often fewer than 100, with loans ranging from a couple of million dollars to more than $100 million. A CMBS servicer, usually a big financial institution like <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> and <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, collects monthly payments from the borrowers and passes the money on to the institutional investors that buy the securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CMBS, of course, aren't the only kind of commercial-real-estate debt suffering higher defaults. Banks hold $1.7 trillion of commercial mortgages and construction loans, and delinquencies on this debt already have played a role in bank failures this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But banks' losses from commercial mortgages have the potential to mount sharply, and the high foreclosure rate in the CMBS market could play a role in this. Until now, banks have been able to keep a lid on commercial-real-estate losses by extending debt when it has matured as long as the underlying properties are generating enough cash to pay debt service. Banks have had a strong incentive to refinance because relaxed accounting standards have enabled them to avoid marking the value of the loans down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CMBS are held by scores of investors, and the servicers of CMBS loans have limited flexibility to extend or restructure troubled loans like banks do. Earlier last month, it was no coincidence that CMBS mortgages accounted for the debt on six of the seven California office buildings that Maguire Properties said it was giving up. "During most of the evolution [of CMBS] no one ever thought all these loans would go into default," says Nelson Rising, Maguire's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INDEED, MANY property developers and investors complain there is no way to identify the investors that hold their debt and that it is difficult to negotiate with CMBS servicers. In light of the complaints, the Treasury is considering guidance that would allow servicers to start talking about ways to avoid defaults and foreclosures sooner, according to people familiar with the matter. But investors in CMBS bonds argue that the servicers are ultimately bound contractually to the bondholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Maguire will soon have a lot of company. In a study for The Wall Street Journal, Realpoint found that 281 CMBS loans valued at $6.3 billion weren't able to refinance when they matured in the past three month, even though 173 such loans worth $5.1 billion were throwing off more than enough cash to service their debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mounting foreclosures in the CMBS sector would likely depress values even further as property is dumped on the market. And this would put pressure on banks to write down loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial-real-estate market could yet be salvaged by an improving economy and bailout programs coming out of Washington. In addition, capital markets are starting to ease for publicly traded real-estate investment trusts. Still, most of the $6.7 trillion in commercial real estate is privately owned. Also, it is unlikely commercial real estate will benefit much from an early stage of an economic recovery. What landlords need is occupancy and rents to rise, and that means employers have to start hiring and consumers need to shop more. So far, there are few signs this is happening.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sudeep Reddy   </div><div>642 words</div><div>27 August 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for big-ticket items from airplanes to appliances surged in July at their fastest pace in two years, reflecting improvement in the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, new-home sales rose a sharp 9.6% last month in their fourth straight monthly increase, another sign of a recovery taking hold in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 4.9% increase in orders for durable goods -- such items as cars and appliances that are designed to last three years or more -- came largely from the transportation sector, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Orders for commercial aircraft and parts more than doubled. Auto orders also rose as car manufacturers started to ramp up production, in part to replace vehicles sold under the government's "cash for clunkers" program, which started in July and gave buyers trading in old cars as much as $4,500 toward the purchase of a new vehicle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key gauge of future business investment -- orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft -- dipped 0.3% in July, but the prior month's figure was revised up sharply. Those orders are now 7.7% above their April trough, "a signal that capital equipment demand in the U.S. and abroad has turned the corner," said Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight. "These gains suggest that capital equipment spending will begin to increase again in the current quarter."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Improvement in business equipment spending will be key to maintaining the economic recovery, as consumer spending is likely to remain weak because of high unemployment and slow wage gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of overall durable goods declined 0.8%, a positive sign of manufacturing increases ahead as firms replace products in warehouses and dealer lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department's report on housing added to evidence that the sector is helping to pull the overall economy out of the deep recession. July's new-home sales rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 433,000 homes, the highest pace since September and 32% above the trough in January. The latest strength suggests home construction this year could support overall growth in the economy, rather than subtract from it, for the first time since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say the improvement was supported by lower prices -- the median price in July was $210,100, down 11.5% from a year earlier -- and a tax credit for first-time homebuyers that expires in November. But homebuilding activity remains at very low levels, down 13% from a year ago and a fraction of the peak of 1.3 million during the housing boom. The monthly data also tend to be volatile, in part due to a small sample size, so the recent surge could moderate in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales "are still at one of their lowest levels in the last half century," said <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> economist Abiel Reinhart. "With sales so low, there is considerable room for them to rise in coming quarters even if one does not expect them to get anywhere close to their level at the peak of the housing boom."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July's sales jumped sharply in the Northeast and South, rose slightly in the West and declined in the Midwest. The inventory of new homes for sale fell 3.2% for the month to 271,000, the lowest in 16 years. That pushed supply down to 7.5 months from 8.5 months, the lowest since April 2007 and well below the 12.4 months in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data on new-home sales follow a series of other reports indicating the housing sector is slowly recovering. Existing-home sales rose 7.2% in July, while the Case-Shiller home-price index posted its second straight monthly increase in June.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Peter A. McKay and Geoffrey Rogow   </div><div>851 words</div><div>27 August 2009</div><div>05:18</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks inched higher Wednesday as a report of rising new home sales and better-than-expected durable-goods orders failed to excite investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After wavering between slight gains and losses for much of the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 4.23 points, less than 0.1%, to 9543.52, eking out a seventh straight day of gains. Decliners were led by industrials, such as 3M, Caterpillar and <span class="companylink">General Electric</span>, and financials, including <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span>. Both sectors had been at the forefront of the Dow's recent winning streak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nasdaq Composite Index was up less than one point at 2024.43. The S&amp;P also gained just under a point to 1028.12, hurt by a 1% decline in its industrial sector. Its materials sector was off 0.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strategist Jim Paulsen, of <span class="companylink">Wells Capital Management</span> in Minneapolis, and other market veterans note trading volume remained generally light on the session, as has regularly been the case recently. That has caused traders to take the market's sharp gains, including recent closes in major indexes at their highest levels since the fall, with a grain of salt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I feel like the gains we've seen are mostly because people stopped selling, but we have yet to see a rally driven by a great influx of buyers," said Mr. Paulsen. "I think that's because people are still shellshocked a little bit. If we'd had a more normal market low at, say, 900 [on the S&amp;P 500] rather than sub-700, sentiment might be a little different."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, NYSE Composite volume was about 4.3 billion shares, compared with about 5.9 billion on average for 2009. There were 1,289 advancers versus 1,672 decliners on the exchange, a discrepancy some cited as reason the Dow may break its current winning streak at Wednesday's close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks opened lower, but briefly tipped into positive territory as the Commerce Department reported that sales of new homes climbed by 9.6% in July, a much stronger increase than analysts expected. Another closely watched measure -- the inventory of unsold homes -- fell to 7.5 months of supply, the lowest level since April 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many analysts have been looking for a drawdown of inventory to boost the value of homes and in turn bolster many homeowners' wealth and spending power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, the market's reaction to the latest report was muted compared with Friday's brisk 156-point jump in the Dow following better-than-expected data on sales of existing homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said some buyers may already have placed bets on a housing recovery following that earlier release. Some market veterans also note that the housing data are being boosted by a rush from buyers looking to exploit a tax credit due to expire this fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other economic news Wednesday, demand for durable goods rebounded sharply in July, staging its biggest gain in two years on the back of big orders for planes and capital goods. Orders for durable goods jumped 4.9% last month to a seasonally adjusted $168.43 billion, the Commerce Department said, the largest increase since 5.4% in July 2007. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had projected a 3% gain in July orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, a key measure of business investment, slipped 0.3% in July. The weak reading had weighed on futures and looked to damp stocks, though some of that weakness was mitigated by the home sales report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other markets, oil prices tumbled following a second round of bearish inventory data. Crude futures closed down 62 cents at $71.40 a barrel in New York, on track for their second decline in the last seven trading sessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Euphoria in the oil market lost steam on Tuesday when the American Petroleum Institute, an oil-industry group, reported a 4.3-million barrel build in U.S. crude inventories for its latest weekly reporting period. Bearish sentiment took a firmer hold on Wednesday after the Energy Information Administration released its tally of inventories. The federal agency said stockpiles rose by 100,000 barrels last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The traditional fundamentals are starting to take over again in this market," said energy analyst Phil Flynn, of PFGBest Research in Chicago. "We were being driven before on oil's relationship to stocks and the dollar, which are fundamentals in a sense. But now it's more about supply and demand," which looks likely to remain weak due to the lingering effects of the U.S. recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasurys were slightly weaker Wednesday afternoon after another satisfactory note auction, the second of three this week. In recent trade, the five-year note was off 1/32 to yield 2.449%, the 10-year added 1/32 to 3.437% and the two-year was 1/32 lower to yield 1.063%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Tom Barkley </div><div>615 words</div><div>27 August 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. economic recovery gathered steam in July, according to better-than-expected reports issued Wednesday on manufacturing and the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two segments of the economy that were among the weakest during the depths of the recession -- new-home sales and durable-goods orders -- both registered big gains last month to bolster the view held by many economists that the U.S. economic contraction is coming to an end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The continued recovery in durable-goods orders and new-homes sales in July adds to the evidence that activity in the manufacturing and housing sectors is expanding again," said Paul Ashworth, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics. "However, with the consumer still supine, we don't yet have the foundations for a sustainable recovery."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales climbed more than anticipated in July, staging their fourth straight month of strong gains. Demand for long-lasting goods also rebounded sharply, staging its biggest gain in two years on big orders for planes and capital goods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes increased 9.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 433,000 compared with the prior month, the Commerce Department said. That was the highest number sold since September 2008 and well above expectations for a 1.6% gain to 390,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These new numbers are another sign that we have put the brakes on the worst economic downturn in generations," Rebecca Blank, undersecretary of Commerce for economic affairs, said in a statement. She said increased distribution of stimulus money going into year end should continue to support growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales increase was the fifth in seven months, as buyers are returning to the market in search of bargains. The market for new homes appears to have bottomed in January, when sales hit 329,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new-home-sales report is the latest in a string of positive news for the housing market. On Tuesday, the closely watched Case-Shiller index showed that home prices rose in the second quarter for the first time in three years and were up for the second straight month in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the median price for a new home was $210,100 in July, down 11.5% from $237,300 the same month a year ago, according to the data. On a monthly basis, the price edged down 0.1% from $210,400 in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">June new-home sales were revised upward to an annual rate of 395,000, a 9.1% increase. Originally, the government had reported an 11% jump in June sales to 384,000, though May sales were also revised upward, to 362,000 from 346,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year over year, July new-home sales were still down 13.4%, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, manufacturers' orders for durable goods jumped 4.9% last month to a seasonally adjusted $168.43 billion. Economists had expected a 3% gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall durable-goods orders for June were revised upward, estimated to have declined 1.3% instead of the 2.2% drop previously reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the report suggests that the manufacturing sector has turned the corner, economists saw some signs of weakness behind the positive headline figures: Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- a key barometer for capital spending by U.S. businesses -- fell 0.3% after a 3.6% gain in June. "This suggests that the 'green shoots' are likely to be a temporary development," said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for all durables except defense goods increased 4.3% in July, also a two-year high, after rising 0.7% in June.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sudeep Reddy </div><div>643 words</div><div>27 August 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for big-ticket items from airplanes to appliances surged in July at their fastest pace in two years, reflecting improvement in the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, new-home sales rose a sharp 9.6% last month in their fourth straight monthly increase, another sign of a recovery taking hold in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 4.9% increase in orders for durable goods -- such items as cars and appliances that are designed to last three years or more -- came largely from the transportation sector, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Orders for commercial aircraft and parts more than doubled. Auto orders also rose as car manufacturers started to ramp up production, in part to replace vehicles sold under the government's "cash for clunkers" program, which started in July and gave buyers trading in old cars as much as $4,500 toward the purchase of a new vehicle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key gauge of future business investment -- orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft -- dipped 0.3% in July, but the prior month's figure was revised up sharply. Those orders are now 7.7% above their April trough, "a signal that capital equipment demand in the U.S. and abroad has turned the corner," said Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight. "These gains suggest that capital equipment spending will begin to increase again in the current quarter."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Improvement in business equipment spending will be key to maintaining the economic recovery, as consumer spending is likely to remain weak due to high unemployment and slow wage gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of overall durable goods declined 0.8%, a positive sign of manufacturing increases ahead as firms replace products in warehouses and dealer lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department's report on housing added to evidence that the sector is helping to pull the overall economy out of the deep recession. July's new-home sales rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 433,000 homes, the highest pace since September and 32% above the trough in January. The latest strength suggests home construction this year could support overall growth in the economy, rather than subtract from it, for the first time since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say the improvement was supported by lower prices -- the median price in July was $210,100, down 11.5% from a year earlier -- and a tax credit for first-time homebuyers that expires in November. But homebuilding activity remains at very low levels, down 13% from a year ago and a fraction of the peak of 1.3 million during the housing boom. The monthly data also tend to be volatile, in part due to a small sample size, so the recent surge could moderate in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales "are still at one of their lowest levels in the last half century," said <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> economist Abiel Reinhart. "With sales so low, there is considerable room for them to rise in coming quarters even if one does not expect them to get anywhere close to their level at the peak of the housing boom."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July's sales jumped sharply in the Northeast and South, rose slightly in the West and declined in the Midwest. The inventory of new homes for sale fell 3.2% for the month to 271,000, the lowest in 16 years. That pushed supply down to 7.5 months from 8.5 months, the lowest since April 2007 and well below the 12.4 months in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data on new-home sales follow a series of other reports indicating the housing sector is slowly recovering. Existing-home sales rose 7.2% in July, while the Case-Shiller home-price index posted its second straight monthly increase in June.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the peak of the real-estate boom, U.S. investors dominated the game in European property. Now, with the exception of a few deals, the Americans have retreated and are now net sellers of European commercial property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first half of this year, U.S. investors spent €407 million ($581.7 million) on commercial-property assets in Europe, down 98% from the peak of U.S. involvement in the first half of 2007, when Americans invested €20.7 billion in European property, according to a report by property-services group <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first half of 2007, U.S. buyers accounted for about 16% of all transactions. By the first half of 2008, this fell to 9.1%. In the first half of this year, U.S. investors accounted for just 1.6% of all transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we're seeing is that the global investor, the American institutional investor, has pulled back dramatically," says Ray Torto, global chief economist for CBRE. "It is local and national investors who are buying real estate at the moment. The global buyers are not in the ball game."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the larger European sales by an American property investor this year is developer Tishman Speyer Properties' sale of the 182,000-square-foot Centurium building in London, which it sold to German fund BVK International Immobilien-Spezialfonds for £128 million ($210 million) in an all-cash deal. Tishman bought the building in 2005 for £100 million and sold it fully leased. "The peak of our buying was in 2005. Since then we've been net sellers," says Michael Spies, the co-head of Tishman Speyer's European business. "But we're not out of the game. We're looking to buy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another sale by a U.S. investor, AIG Lincoln, the partnership between AIG Global Real Estate Investment, a unit of <span class="companylink">American International Group</span>, and Dallas-based <span class="companylink">Lincoln Property Company</span>, sold its Grzybowska Park office complex in Warsaw's central business district for €70 million to the German open-ended property fund Deka Immobilien. Also, <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>., as part of a plan to raise cash by disposing of assets, sold its Milan offices in a sale and leaseback for €50 million. And <span class="companylink">ProLogis</span>, the Denver-based real estate investment trust, has sold several assets including a portfolio of properties in the Netherlands and Germany to <span class="companylink">AEW Europe</span> for €119.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when American investors are involved in European transactions, they still are taking on a distinctly Continental flavor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take the case of the purchase by F&amp;C REIT Asset Management and <span class="companylink">AREA Property Partners</span> of a largely retail portfolio of 211 properties for €669 million, the largest transaction in Europe so far this year. AREA is a New York-based fund manager. But F&amp;C, a U.K. real-estate investment trust, took the lead role, and it was F&amp;C's local relationship with the seller that played a big role in sealing the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The portfolio went into receivership after its owner, financial-services group Dawnay Day, collapsed in 2008. The administrator, working closely with the creditor -- Britain's largest insurance group, Norwich Union, now called <span class="companylink">Aviva PLC</span> -- sold the portfolio to the F&amp;C-led group in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aviva shopped the portfolio. In addition to F&amp;C REIT, some U.S. private-equity funds such as <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> were in the bidding, according to a person familiar with the talks. This person says Blackstone was interested in the portfolio, but was pushing for aggressive terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, Aviva chose F&amp;C REIT and AREA. "We were interested in moving the portfolio to another investor and tend to lend on long terms, 15 to 20 years, and these were people we have been very familiar with over a number of years," says Kevin Sale, Aviva's commercial-finance director. Blackstone didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anton Troianovski   </div><div>941 words</div><div>26 August 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overleveraged private real-estate funds are gasping for money, but public property companies have been chugging down cash from the capital markets. Now, they are poised to emerge as more-dominant players when the commercial-property-market starts to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many expect the landscape change to be as profound as it was in the early 1990s, when many real-estate developers went public to avoid bankruptcy and helped turn real-estate investment trusts into a major force in the property market. Most of the leading private real-estate funds during that time vanished from the scene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs are poised once again to pick up the pieces from the commercial-property bust. This year, they have tapped the stock market for nearly $15 billion in new equity and, this month have raised $2 billion in unsecured debt. The equity deals diluted shareholders' ownership stakes, but positioned many REITs -- such as mall owner <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group Inc</span>. and warehouse landlord <span class="companylink">ProLogis</span> -- to avoid loan defaults and have buying power when distress hits the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few of the private-equity funds that became Wall Street stars during the boom can say the same thing. An increasing number are trying to raise cash to recapitalize existing investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the strategy has been a hard sell. The Townsend Group's Martin Rosenberg, who consults institutions on their real-estate investments, says he has seen 16 funds make such proposals since late last year, but only one has raised all the equity it asked for. Two others raised part of what they were seeking, and two more are on track to succeed, Mr. Rosenberg adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Funds also are having trouble raising money to take advantage of distressed opportunities because their traditional investors -- pension funds and other institutions -- have little to invest after going on a real-estate binge in the mid-2000s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country's 50 biggest public pension plans are on pace to commit only $5 billion to real-estate investment vehicles this year, according to trade publication Real Estate Alert. That would be the lowest total since 2003, compared with $17 billion last year and a peak of $36 billion in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, property funds raised $370 billion from 2003 to 2008, according to Probitas Partners, a San Francisco research firm. They were seen by many investors as being more nimble than public REITs, and they goosed returns with mountains of cheap debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that debt has led to a spate of bankruptcies at companies taken over by private-equity funds -- such as <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley Real Estate</span>'s <span class="companylink">Crescent Resources LLC</span> and <span class="companylink">Colony Capital LLC</span>'s <span class="companylink">Station Casinos Inc</span>. -- and huge markdowns across the industry. Even <span class="companylink">Prudential Financial Inc</span>.'s $11 billion PRISA fund, with a reputation as one of the most conservative in the industry, told investors last month to expect a 55% peak-to-trough loss by the beginning of next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-equity funds invest money from pension funds and other institutional investors to buy properties or entire real-estate companies. They collect part of the profits and earn management fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of publicly traded REITs, meanwhile, can be bought and sold by rank-and-file investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs, under closer scrutiny from analysts and shareholders, didn't take on as much debt as their private counterparts and proved to be astute sellers as the market peaked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006 and 2007, as values skyrocketed and private-equity funds and institutional investors were net buyers of $134 billion of property, public REITs sold $94 billion more in real estate than they bought, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span> data cited by Green Street Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several publicly owned landlords, including <span class="companylink">Equity Office Properties</span> and apartment giant <span class="companylink">Archstone-Smith Trust</span>, went private in huge buyouts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their more-conservative strategy is now paying off, and REITs' lower leverage and greater transparency is attracting investors rattled by the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors rushed into the sector this spring after REITs fell 75% below their February 2007 peak. A survival-of-the-fittest storyline that many expected turned into a much broader rally as at least 48 successful stock offerings injected cash into the REITs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everyone was predicting a have-and-have-not scenario, and that didn't play out at all," says Debra Cafaro, chief executive of health-care REIT Ventas Inc. "What happened was indiscriminate access to capital, which has buoyed the whole sector."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs, to be sure, are still suffering, and no one can tell when the commercial real-estate market will start to recover. The Dow Jones Equity All REIT Index is still at about half its February 2007 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dilutive effect of the REITs' equity offerings has dismayed many investors, and some are wary of how volatile REIT stock prices have become.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some private-equity funds, meanwhile, still have "dry powder" -- cash commitments from investors that haven't yet been put to use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most agree that public companies now have the best access to capital, the lifeblood of real-estate investing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Starwood Capital Group LLC</span>, which operates several private-equity property funds, recently raised $810 million in the public market to buy distressed debt, and other firms have said they will try the same thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think there are times when the public market is the better solution for a greater variety of strategies and a greater variety of assets, and I think that's more true right now than it's been in a while," says Randy Rowe, the chairman of <span class="companylink">Green Courte Partners LLC</span>, a Chicago private-equity real-estate firm.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>759 words</div><div>26 August 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in major U.S. cities rose for the second straight month in June in the latest sign the housing market may be steadying after years of declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index for home prices in 20 major cities in the three months ended June 30 was up 1.4% from its level in the three months ended May 31. It was the first time the index rose two months in a row since mid-2006. Prices gained in 18 of 20 markets, but were still down 31% from their July 2006 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Momentum matters," said Robert Shiller, the Yale University economist who helped create the index. "This is a sudden break in momentum."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hint of improvement in housing and the broader economy was underscored in a separate report Tuesday showing consumer attitudes improved in August after two months of decline. The Conference Board's consumer-confidence index rose to a level of 54.1 in August, just shy of the 54.8 level reached in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One component of the index, consumer expectations of where the economy will be in six months, rose to 75.8, its highest since the recession began in December 2007. Consumers' assessment of present conditions also improved, along with stepped-up plans for buying homes, autos and several major appliances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists and real-estate professionals warn that a recovery in housing is likely to be bumpy: Home prices could drop again as job losses drive foreclosures higher. "It really is too soon to call this as a turning point," Mr. Shiller said, recalling a slowdown in price declines in early 2008 before the deteriorating economy sent housing back into a tailspin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A narrower Case-Shiller index of home prices in 10 major metropolitan areas is down 15.1% for the last 12 months and down 5.5% so far this year. Government officials used that measure when modeling their assumptions for stress tests to gauge the health of U.S. banks earlier this year. Under a baseline scenario, officials predicted declines of 14% for 2009, while an adverse scenario forecast a 22% drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate price gauge calculated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which uses sales price information on mortgages owned or backed by government-backed mortgage investors <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, showed that prices increased 0.5% in June from May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, sales of existing single-family homes in California increased 12% in July from the same time a year ago, the California Association of Realtors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent home-price gains have been driven, in part, by competition between first-time buyers and investors offering to pay cash for distressed properties. Demand also has been boosted by government intervention that helped drive mortgage rates to half-century lows in the spring and a tax credit of up to $8,000 for first-time home buyers, set to expire Nov. 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stefan Nissen, a 34-year-old emergency-room nurse, and his wife, a schoolteacher, are buying a three-bedroom home in Novato, Calif., a San Francisco suburb. The home is selling for around $500,000 in a short sale -- a transaction in which the sales price falls short of the mortgage balance owed by the seller. "We actually looked to buy two years ago and could not get into anything in the area," said Mr. Nissen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, headwinds remain. Mortgage defaults and foreclosures aren't likely to peak until unemployment ebbs. The rate of 90-day delinquencies on loans owned or guaranteed by <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> rose to nearly 3% in July from 2.8% in June and 1% in July 2008. While rising demand has helped soak up foreclosure inventory in several hard-hit markets, rising mortgage defaults have fueled concerns among real-estate professionals that the supply of new foreclosures could jump later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The government has not yet handled the foreclosure problem," said Mr. Shiller. The success of efforts to stave off foreclosures by modifying mortgages and the firming of demand for homes will determine whether the gains in home prices last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas and Detroit were the only markets that saw monthly price declines in June. Home prices in Las Vegas have dropped by 54.3% from the August 2006 peak, moving ahead of Phoenix, which is down by 53.9% from its June 2006 peak.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">ESSAY; A Toe in the Water; Real estate is starting to look cheap enough to buy. Or at least think about buying.</span>
</div><div class="author">By Dave Kansas   </div><div>956 words</div><div>24 August 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently over dinner, a friend of mine startled me by saying he and his wife were looking to buy a lake cabin. I figured that in this time of economic uncertainty, people would still be stuffing their mattresses with hard, cold cash. But buying real estate? That seemed particularly surprising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more I've talked to people, though, the more I get a sense that things have started to change. While the economy remains in rough shape and the jobless rate continues to rise, the frantic desire to save and build cash reserves has ebbed. Those fortunate people who have weathered the storm are emerging from their fetal crouch and starting to think more about taking some investment risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What I find especially interesting is where most of my risk-taking friends are headed. It isn't the stock market; in fact, the only folks I know who have waded back into the stock market are the gunslinger types who never really left it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, they seem to be heading for real estate. At first I found this puzzling, given the brutal battering real estate has taken. But that's the point: An increasing number of my friends see this as the perfect opportunity to find something at a bargain-basement price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so, among my friends: A New York executive and his wife are looking for a summer place in New England; a small-business owner in Minnesota is thinking about acquiring some rental property; a New Jersey technology consultant is considering buying a small apartment in New York, perhaps with some other friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case for Real Estate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The people doing this are employed, feel confident that they're not going to lose their jobs, and believe that while housing prices may fall a bit more the bottom is not too far away. Moreover, financing remains relatively cheap and, according to one lawyer I know in house-hunting mode, banks aren't as tight with mortgage lending as headlines indicate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As I wrote a couple of months ago, it's always dangerous to hypothesize a global trend based on the all-too-limited view from your own backyard. But it's also sometimes an insightful way to get a jump on what's coming. And for me, what's most intriguing is that, for now, most of this risk talk is prospective. There's no sense of rushing, no desire to "stretch" too far in making a purchase. It's like these people are permitting themselves to dream a little bit and get closer to pulling the trigger. But they want to be doubly sure before making a move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, all of these people have a similar, cautious, mind-set. They don't believe real estate will rebound or make a great investment. But they also don't think real estate will lose a lot of value. Instead, they are focused on real estate as something they can use: a solid place to live or play that should also be, at worst, an OK investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all investments are the same. You can't live in a stock certificate or gaze wistfully at a bond (at least most of us can't). In what is still a time of tumult, there's something deep inside us that finds the solidity of a home soothing. I think that explains why people moving out on the risk scale are focused more on real estate than on stocks or bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Personal Hunt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My wife and I recently considered buying some property, too. We don't own our home, and we've thought about one day returning to the Midwest. On a recent trip to Minnesota, we looked at several properties, including an old farmstead on the outskirts of St. Paul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Examining the farmstead, it became clear why people who have ridden through this economic storm in decent shape are thinking more about real estate. It had been on the market more than a year, the price had fallen more than 60% and the seller would only take offers that didn't require the sale of another home before closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, we decided not to purchase the house, but we continue to hunt because we believe bargains can be had. We also think those bargains aren't going away anytime soon, which is a thought shared by many and a big reason that real-estate sales remain sluggish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as my friends, as well as my wife and I, consider making real-estate purchases, I am quickly reminded of how real-estate fixations got out of control earlier this decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An entrepreneur I barely know recently confessed how he owned seven homes, all of them rented, all of them underwater. He figures he'll do all he can to hang on until prices rebound. His credit cards are groaning and his business is struggling. He provides a stark reminder that investing in property can go off the rails as quickly as anything else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is probably why the current real-estate chatter I hear sounds very different from the speculative boom of the recent past. While buying a second home or even considering some rental property entails risk, I don't hear the kind of zero-down fervor familiar just a couple years ago. Instead, it's about buying something that you can touch, feel and see—and imagine holding onto for a long time.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes in July jumped at the fastest rate in 10 years, sending stock prices up around the globe on hopes that the U.S. housing market -- a driver of the world's largest economy -- is stabilizing after years of decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes increased 7.2% in July from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.24 million units, the National Association of Realtors said Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly increase was the largest since 1999, when the NAR began collecting data for all types of homes -- its measure includes condominiums and cooperative apartments. It marked the fourth monthly rise in a row. Sales also were up 5% from July 2008, showing the first gain from the year-earlier level since November 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in home sales came as buyers rushed to lock in bargains on foreclosed homes and tap a federal tax credit for first-time buyers that is set to expire in a few months. Yet home sales remain nearly 20% below the pace of 2006, when the housing boom was peaking. Housing economists and even some real-estate agents caution that the recovery is fragile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, low prices and attractive financing are enticing buyers. Jodi Janiga, 32 years old, is using a loan insured by the Federal Housing Administration to buy a two-bedroom townhouse in Green Valley, a Las Vegas planned neighborhood with golf courses and sidewalk statues. That required her to put about $4,200 down on the $119,000 property. Three years ago, similar townhomes in the area sold for $280,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a smoking deal," said Ms. Janiga, a schoolteacher who says she bid on nearly 15 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic outlook is crucial for housing demand, as many potential buyers will hold off as long as they fear job losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most economists say the U.S. economy, which began contracting in December 2007 in what is the deepest and longest recession since World War II, has started growing again. The Fed said manufacturing output rose 1% in July, the strongest increase since December 2006. U.S. exports rose in May and June. Consumers are still dragging on the economy, though, as a high jobless rate, stagnant wages, tight credit and a renewed eagerness to save have restrained spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed sales continue to push down prices. The median U.S. price in July was $178,400, down 15% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales have been aided by a federal tax credit of as much as $8,000 for first-time home buyers. That stimulus will end Nov. 30 unless Congress extends it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sens. Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, and Johnny Isakson, a Republican from Georgia, have introduced legislation to extend the credit, increase it to as much as $15,000 and make it available to all home buyers, not just first-timers. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid backs an extension of the credit.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Peter A. McKay   </div><div>969 words</div><div>22 August 2009</div><div>09:18</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks and oil rallied to the highest levels this year as a report showing strong sales of existing homes boosted investors' hopes for a U.S. economic rebound on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 155.91 points, or 1.7%, to 9505.96, a new closing high for 2009. The broad S&amp;P 500-stock index gained 18.76 points, or 1.9%, to a new yearly high of 1026.13 amid gains in all its sectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks gained momentum after the National Association of Realtors said home resales rose 7.2% in July. That was the largest monthly increase in at least 10 years, as first-time buyers rushed to capitalize on a tax credit that expires this fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market held relatively steady and trading volume slowed following the approximately 15-minute spike in the immediate aftermath of the housing data. But that was enough to leave the market with a solid gain for the session.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing number is certainly the absolute cause of the rally today," said Richard Sparks, senior options trader at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio. "It didn't just beat the consensus; it did so by a stunningly wide margin. When you have things like that happen, you get investors and traders who haven't been fully committed to the market jumping aboard because they suddenly feel like they don't want to miss out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed the size of July's increase in sales in percentage terms was more than triple the expectations of analysts, according to Thomson Reuters data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Futures on crude oil rose 98 cents to $73.89 a barrel in New York, just off its intraday high of $74.72, a new peak for 2009. Traders in recent days have said that speculative buyers have been returning to oil at the same time they buy stocks, producing unusual moves in tandem in those markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A barrel of oil remains roughly half of where it stood at its height last summer, when crude-oil futures on July 11, 2008, hit an intraday high of $146.65. The Dow industrials shed 129 points that day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A year or so ago, higher (oil) prices were bad for the stock market, now the inverse is true. It's seen as a sign of economic recovery," said Kevin Kruszenski, director of equity trading at <span class="companylink">KeyBanc Capital Markets</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other stock benchmarks also cruised to their highest finishes since early October. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 31.68 points, or 1.6%, to 2020.90. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks rose 12.83 points, or 2.3%, to 581.51.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Bollinger, president of Bollinger Capital Management in Manhattan Beach, Calif., said he was particularly encouraged by the rise in the Russell. It has performed the best of the four major indexes lately, rising more than 46% since the beginning of March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's really been the sweet spot of the market," said Mr. Bollinger, who has been betting on the small- and mid-sized companies that make up the Russell as growth plays for the early stages of an economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For that index to be making new highs along with everything else really confirms the trend we've been talking about," he said</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market has recently been behaving as if economic recovery is a foregone conclusion, said Steve Goldman, market strategist with <span class="companylink">Weeden &amp; Co</span>. in Greenwich, Conn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now we're in that recovery phase when the gains become a bit more modest, but they're still forthcoming," he said, noting the broad-based character of Friday's rally. All sectors in the S&amp;P 500 closed higher. "It's not a selective market. We're in a market where everything was cheap and everything has participated in this recovery phase."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some traders are worried that the market could hit turbulence as the U.S. government gradually backs off policies it enacted as emergency measures to spur the economy along following the crisis that erupted late last year. For instance, the big gain in home sales reported Friday was driven in part by first-time buyers rushing to capitalize on a tax credit that expires this fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The economy is off to a good start, but the question is what happens when a lot of these government programs go away," said trader Anthony Conroy, of the brokerage <span class="companylink">BNY ConvergEx</span> in New York. "That's the big question for the market right now, but in the meantime you can't fight the numbers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders also settled expiring options bets on Friday. The Chicago Board Options Exchange's Volatility Index, which uses options prices to gauge investors' level of nervousness, slipped 0.3% to 25.01.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clothing retailer Gap said late Thursday its second-quarter profits dropped 0.4%, narrowly beating expectations even as it posted lower sales across all four of its divisions. Its shares gained 3.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">J.M. Smucker</span>'s fiscal first-quarter earnings more than doubled, driven by its Folgers acquisition and volume increases at its U.S. retail businesses. The company said fiscal-year earnings are more likely to be at the higher end of its previous estimate and affirmed its fiscal-year revenue forecast. Shares rose 4.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overseas, European stocks rose and the euro moved higher after a euro-zone measure of purchasing managers' indexes in the manufacturing and services sector hit the 50 mark, indicating output was neither expanding nor contracting in August. In Asia, the Shanghai Composite rose for the second day in a row, gaining 1.7%, though other leading Asian benchmarks fell.</p>

It marked the fourth monthly rise in a row. Sales also were up 5% from July 2008, showing the first gain from the year-earlier level since November 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news on housing came as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke issued a mostly optimistic report[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125085771862849199.html] Friday on the state of the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Fears of financial collapse have receded substantially," Mr. Bernanke said at the Federal Reserve's annual retreat at Jackson Hole, Wyo. "After contracting sharply over the past year, economic activity appears to be leveling out, both in the U.S. and abroad, and the prospects for a return to growth in the next year appear good."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing report pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average up[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125085283439549091.html] 155.91 points, or 1.7%, to close at 9505.96. The Dow has risen five of the past six weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in home sales came as buyers rushed to lock in bargains on foreclosed homes and tap a federal tax credit for first-time buyers that is set to expire in a few months. Yet home sales remain nearly 20% below the pace of 2006, when the housing boom was peaking. Housing economists and even some real-estate agents caution that the recovery is fragile.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a smoking deal," said Ms. Janiga, a schoolteacher who says she bid on nearly 15 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The buyers are back, and they're buying," but mainly the lowest-priced homes, said Teresa Boardman, a real-estate broker in St. Paul, Minn. Many potential sellers of higher-quality homes are waiting to put them on the market if prices start to rebound, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic outlook is crucial for housing demand, as many potential buyers will hold off as long as they fear job losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most economists say the U.S. economy, which began contracting in December 2007 in what is the deepest and longest recession since World War II, has started growing again. The Fed said manufacturing output rose 1% in July, the strongest increase since December 2006. U.S. exports rose in May and June. Consumers are still dragging on the economy, though, as a high jobless rate, stagnant wages, tight credit and a renewed eagerness to save have restrained spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors said a survey of agents showed that foreclosure-related sales accounted for 31% of July transactions. But foreclosures are a much bigger factor in some markets, particularly in parts of Florida, Nevada, Arizona and California. In the Las Vegas area in July, bank-owned properties accounted for 73% of all sales, according to the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed sales continue to push down prices. The median U.S. price in July was $178,400, down 15% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were also strong in some metro areas that haven't been hit hard by foreclosures, said Tom Lawler, a housing economist in Leesburg, Va. These include Des Moines, Iowa; San Antonio and Roanoke, Va. "I think people who decided to check into the [home-shopping] process were pleasantly surprised by prices and mortgage-credit availability," Mr. Lawler said. The FHA is insuring mortgages for people with down payments of as low as 3.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing also has grown more affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On average, a U.S. household with a median income in the second quarter of this year could afford a home costing 71% more than the median price, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. Three years ago, such a household could have afforded a home only 5% over the median.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with a year earlier, unit sales in July were up 3.3% in the Northeast, 8% in the Midwest, 5.4% in the South and 1.8% in the West, the NAR said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales have been aided by a federal tax credit of as much as $8,000 for first-time home buyers. That stimulus will end Nov. 30 unless Congress extends it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sens. Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, and Johnny Isakson, a Republican from Georgia, have introduced legislation to extend the credit, increase it to as much as $15,000 and make it available to all home buyers, not just first-timers. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid backs an extension of the credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Congress is not going to endanger the fragile beginnings of a housing recovery by letting the credit lapse," said Howard Glaser, a mortgage-industry consultant in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of unsold homes are falling but remain high. And many potential sellers are staying out of the market, waiting for signs of rising prices before trying to sell. That could lead to a bulge in inventory later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 1.8 million homeowners are currently in foreclosure, and the number of future foreclosures could top one million, says Torsten Slok, senior economist at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>. "It's safe to say that we still have a significant amount of foreclosures ahead of us," he said, adding: "It's still not a healthy housing market when you have one third of sales coming from foreclosure sales."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Maryland estate of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who passed away last week, has sold for $7.81 million, 34% less than its original offering price last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Shriver, sister to President John F. Kennedy and Sens. Robert F. and Edward M. Kennedy, owned the property with her husband, Sargent Shriver. She died Aug. 11 at age 88. The 16,000-square-foot, Georgian-style home sits on almost seven acres in the Bradley Farms neighborhood of Potomac, about 20 miles northwest of Washington. The four-story home has 10 bedrooms and 11.5 baths, a foyer stretching the width of the residence and a flagstone terrace along the rear. The estate has a swimming pool, tennis court, pool house and acres of pasture and gardens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Shriver purchased the land in 1985 for $817,400. The house was built in 1986 for the couple and their five children, including first lady of California Maria Shriver.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Shriver founded the Special Olympics and is widely known for her work for the mentally disabled.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Improving Home Sales Belie Market Reality</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has come out of its tailspin, lifted by falling home prices, low mortgage rates and an $8,000 federal tax credit offered to some first-time home buyers. But stability, to say nothing of strength, still looks a long way off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors is expected to report Friday morning that sales of existing homes rose for the fourth consecutive month in July, up 2.2% from June, on a seasonally adjusted basis. Problem is, a lot of the action is in distressed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey conducted in June of 1,500 real-estate agents sponsored by the trade publication Inside Mortgage Finance found that 36% of all sales involve "nondistressed" properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the nondistressed sales, only 31% were what the survey described as "unforced or optional." The rest were sales by homeowners in some kind of financial or personal crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Think about that for a minute," John Mauldin of Millennium Wave Advisors wrote this week. "Two-thirds of home sales are either foreclosures or banks taking a loss on the mortgage." And only a third of the remaining one-third -- roughly 10% of overall sales -- comes from "something we could call a normal selling process."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That first-timer credit has sparked sales, and the NAR expects a flurry of sales in the next few months, as the credit expires Nov. 30. At the low end, it is a "feeding frenzy," says Jim Klinge of Klinge Realty in San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Thursday that the number of homeowners behind on their mortgage payments hit a new high during the second quarter, with more than one in eight homeowners delinquent or in the foreclosure process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it is likely that sales will stay mired on the low end of the housing barbell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last July, sales of existing homes hit a five-month high, leading the NAR to openly hope a sustained upturn was coming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, home sales are roughly where they were last year. Given the state of the consumer and the rise in foreclosures, they may be at this point again next year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ruins of <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span>'s aggressive and unorthodox growth strategy is no more apparent than in the Windy City, where roughly 75% of the bankrupt bank's branches have gone dark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a stark harbinger of what looms ahead for recession-battered retail real estate. A growing number of vacant branches being dumped on the market due to mergers and Chapter 11 filings are poised to push vacancy rates higher and exacerbate weak property values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During boom times, <span class="companylink">WaMu</span> opened about 170 branches in the Chicago area. The growth spurt underscored the Seattle company's ambition to be the <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> of retail banking. <span class="companylink">WaMu</span> attempted to build a presence in "Chicagoland" from the ground up by opening brand new branches to attract customers. It was a nontraditional strategy given that banks usually purchase an existing bank or branch network to expand into new regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As <span class="companylink">WaMu</span> struggled, it shuttered about 60 branches in Chicagoland before it went bankrupt and was acquired by <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. (JPM) earlier this year. Subsequently, <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> closed about 70 more branches in the area, leaving only 40 of the original <span class="companylink">WaMu</span> branches open, a company spokesman confirmed. Nationwide, Chase has closed nearly 400 one-time <span class="companylink">WaMu</span> branches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar scenarios are seen across the country as troubled commercial real estate loans, a brutal recession, a housing downturn and online banking are forcing many national and regional banks to merge, scale back or go out of business. <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. (BAC) reportedly hinted in July that it could close 10% of its roughly 6,000 branch network, though the Charlotte bank has since distanced itself from those reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent mergers including <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group Inc</span>.'s (PNC) purchase of <span class="companylink">National City Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span>.'s (WFC) purchase of <span class="companylink">Wachovia Corp</span>. are likely to result in some branch closures to due to overlap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's definitely going to have a softening impact in terms of values," said Patrick Duffy, chairman of Colliers International's retail services group. He said there is a lot more supply of freestanding bank branch properties coming on line than there is demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's not a lot people starting up banks, expanding or starting credit unions," noting conversions of bank branches can be difficult, he said. "If you want to go to an office use it devalues the property significantly and banks have a somewhat unique footprint that doesn't work for many retailers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail-sales declines, fueled by steep drops in discretionary spending, have supported higher vacancy rates and increased difficulties for landlords.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For banking retail, most vulnerable are branches that were located in suburban areas and in housing bubble states like in California and Florida. "Many of the banks were looking at the projected housing starts and population growth statistics and were making decisions based on those (factors) and growth markets," said Scott Burns, a broker with Wilson Commercial Real Estate, which represents grocery-anchored shopping centers in southern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The banking industry was one of the first groups that we saw pullback in late 2007," when the recession took root, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burns said there are two vacant Citibank and one empty <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> branch in his portfolio. The branches are dark, but the banks are still paying the rent until the leases expire in about five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Unless the bank finds a subtenant or unless there's the higher-paying tenant out there that really wants the space," the leases remain intact, Mr. Burns said. "In this market right now, we're not seeing the demand. We're not seeing the rent at the same level it was."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the number of dark bank branches is growing, the amount is a relatively small fraction of the nearly 100,000 domestic branches operating nationwide, as of the end of 2008, according to the American Bankers Association, citing <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span> data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most leases for these property types are signed for 15 to 20 years. Freestanding banks located in dense urban areas, on street corners and main intersections are considered prime real estate and usually see high demand. Those in suburban markets and tertiary markets won't fare as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burns said the biggest challenge is that bank branches are 4,500 to 5,500 square feet and built for single-purpose uses. "They're not necessarily transferable to other retailers. A lot are square and box shaped rather than rectangular, which would lend itself to splitting up for multiple tenants," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sara Murray </div><div>534 words</div><div>19 August 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction and permits fell in the U.S. last month, but single-family-home starts remained strong, another sign of stabilization in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multifamily housing starts, a more volatile measure that includes properties such as condominiums and small apartment buildings, pulled overall housing starts down 1% in July from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted 581,000 annual rate, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. That compares with a 6.5% increase in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of single-family homes, though, rose 1.7%, to 490,000, in July after climbing 17.8% in June. Single-family permits, a sign of future construction, rose 5.8%. The rise in construction marked the fifth consecutive monthly gain, showing once again that the housing market is firming up, albeit at a slow pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many economists agree the market already has hit bottom, housing-sector growth may not be a contributor to gross domestic product until next year because it is rebounding from such an extreme low. Singe-family starts are still 73% below their December 2005 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You don't want to lose sight of the fact that these are extremely depressed levels," said <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Securities</span> economist Adam G. York. "It's not necessarily time to break out the champagne and celebrate the boom of a returning housing market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in single-family homes falls in line with home builders' optimism in the National Association of Home Builders Housing Market Index released this week. The future-sales index rose four points, and prospective-buyer traffic rose three points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While housing appears to be slowly recovering, a number of factors could cause hiccups. New homes are still competing with readily available, and cheap, foreclosure properties. And an $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers, which has helped spur interest in the single-family-home market, expires Dec. 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing report showed that overall building permits fell 1.8%. Double-digit declines in both housing starts and permits for multifamily homes were down as tight credit for commercial real estate and an abundance of multifamily homes put pressure on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total housing starts dropped in every region of the U.S. except for the Midwest, where they grew by 12.9%. In the Northeast they dropped 16.3%; in the South, 1.4%; and in the West, 1.6%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Monthly data for housing activity are volatile but today's nominal decline stands as a reminder that the economy is still fragile," Rebecca Blank, U.S. undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs, said in a release. "Looking at the big picture, we are confident that we've created the stability necessary to turn things around."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate release Tuesday, the U.S.'s producer price index for finished goods declined 0.9% in July after a 1.8% increase in June, the Labor Department said. The index is down 6.8% from a year earlier, highlighting the low risk of inflation to the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Core prices, excluding food and energy, fell 0.1% last month.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jonathan Cheng </div><div>527 words</div><div>19 August 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>28</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG -- Chinese commercial-property developer <span class="companylink">Soho China Ltd</span>. made its first acquisition outside its home base of Beijing, paying about $360 million to a <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> real-estate fund for a 52-story office and retail tower on the edge of one of Shanghai's main business districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong-listed Soho said it would lease the office space in the building or sell it in pieces, starting in September. Soho also will manage the building, which it is rebranding as The Exchange -- Soho.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transaction offers a profitable exit for the <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> fund, which purchased the then-unfinished building in August 2006 for about $245 million and did construction and upgrade work before selling it to Soho.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purchase represents confidence from one of China's highest-profile developers that commercial property in mainland China's financial hub will recover strongly as the government tries to get the economy back on track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though brokers and analysts are generally positive about the longer-term prospects for Shanghai's office-leasing market, the short term presents immediate challenges, with substantial supply hitting the market at a time when tenants are delaying expansion amid concerns about the global economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the second quarter of 2009, Shanghai's top-grade office market saw its first quarter-on-quarter increase in vacancy in recent years, hitting 14.1%, according to property brokers Colliers International. At the same time, Colliers said, average rents fell 9% when compared with the first quarter of the year</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The timing of the purchase suggests that Soho sees upside in the current environment. The developer has said for years that it would stick with the Beijing market it knows best, though company executives have said in recent months that they would invest in other markets after careful consideration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Although this is our first foray into Shanghai, it certainly won't be our last," Soho Chairman Pan Shiyi said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pan said he still saw commercial property in Shanghai as "undervalued" compared with the residential market, adding that he had little interest in investing in the city's residential property market. "We want to buy where prices are cheap, rather than chasing rising prices," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building, one of Shanghai's tallest skyscrapers at a height of 712 feet, had changed hands a few times since construction began in the mid-1990s. Mr. Pan said Tuesday that about 30% of the office space is being leased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pan declined to say at what prices he hoped to sell or lease the office space, but Soho has a strong track record in Beijing for selling pieces of office space at a premium to what the whole building might fetch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, the transaction is a key divestment, given its size. The U.S. investment bank's real-estate funds have a large portfolio of commercial and residential properties in the Shanghai area, much of it accumulated during the property boom that ended in late 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> spokesman declined to comment Tuesday.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Treasury prices jumped at a set of surprisingly grisly housing figures early Tuesday, but a volatile morning's trade left the market mixed around noon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharp declines in residential construction in July upset the increasingly popular theory that the embattled U.S. housing sector is past its worst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By noon, the 10-year note was down 1/32, for a 3.496% yield, while the two-year note was unchanged, yielding 1.020%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported U.S. housing construction fell 1% on the month in July, to a seasonally adjusted 581,000 annual rate. That flouted Wall Street forecasts for a 2.7% increase, and contrasted with June's 6.5% rise to 587,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits also dropped unexpectedly last month, by 1.8% to a 560,000 annual rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Producer-price data released alongside the housing figures also gave Treasurys a bump. The Labor Department's index for the cost of finished goods dropped 0.9% in July. That was more than twice the expected 0.4% decline, though it reversed only half of the previous month's 1.8% rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The core producer price index, which excludes food and energy, fell 0.1% in July.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jim Carlton </div><div>692 words</div><div>11 August 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>21</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ONTARIO, Calif. -- One drag on recovery in Southern California is illustrated by three new office buildings near the LA/Ontario International Airport. One is 60% leased. The other two sit empty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While real estate is in a funk across the U.S., Southern California's economy is more reliant on the construction than many other places. So until these vacant buildings and hundreds of others like them fill up, the prospects for a rebound in construction and the broader economy here are bleak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its peak four years ago, construction was the fourth-largest employer in the Inland Empire counties of San Bernardino and Riverside, according to Jack Kyser, chief economist at Los Angeles Economic Development Corp., a nonprofit research group. The housing industry contributed more than $24 billion in revenue to the Southern California economy in 2008, or more than double the U.S. gross revenue from Hollywood movies, according to the Building Industry Association of Southern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much has changed. "New construction is now literally stopped," said Katherine Aguilar Perez, executive director of the Urban Land Institute's office in Los Angeles. The industry has shed jobs as new building starts have plummeted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The greater Los Angeles area has lost about 90,000 construction jobs, or 15% of the total in the past year, more than any other metropolitan area, according to the Associated General Contractors of America. The Inland Empire, east of Los Angeles, has lost about 60,000 construction jobs since 2006, or 49% of its total, according to John Husing, a consulting economist in Redlands, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the number of housing permits in the five-county greater Los Angeles region has dropped 85% from 88,187 in 2005 to a projected 12,990 this year, Mr. Kyser said. The fall has been even steeper in San Bernardino and Riverside counties, where housing permits have plunged 96% from 45,299 in 2005 to a projected 2,000 this year, Mr. Husing said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even big builders have suspended much of their work. Lewis Group of Cos. said it has put on hold two big master-planned communities. "We're going to going to just wait until we see a recovery," said Randall Lewis, executive vice president of the Upland, Calif., developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, construction won't be poised to play its frequent role of leading the region of almost 25 million people out of the recession. "It's going to be difficult this time, because it won't be one sector you can point to to lead the way," Mr. Kyser said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, vacancy rates show no signs of turning around. Office vacancies in San Bernardino and Riverside counties have more than tripled, to 24.6% from 8% in 2006, according to estimates by broker <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>. At the same time, the Inland Empire's retail vacancy rate shot up to 10.6% in the second quarter from about 5% in 2006, according to CB.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That retail vacancy rate has spelled financial trouble for many malls. In Corona, owners of the Promenade Shops at Dos Lagos defaulted on their $125 million loan last autumn and said they have since tried to work out a restructuring with the lender. Officials of the mall's owner, Poag &amp;McEwen Lifestyle Centers LLC, said they hope to avoid foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high level of office and retail vacancies suggests builders in those markets may have the toughest time in coming months. Until now, home builders have shouldered the brunt of the construction fall. Since 2007, the Building Industry Association of Southern California, which represents mostly home builders, has seen its membership fall 33% to 1,600 members from 2,400 as a result of bankruptcies and other factors, said spokeswoman Julie Senter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The builders who have survived have done so largely by cutting staff as much as 90%. "The builders have had to scramble like mad to keep their doors open," said Mark Knorringa, chief executive of the Building Industry Association of Riverside County, an industry trade group.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't easy to build up the nerve to ask your landlord for a reduction in rent. But these days having the gumption to renegotiate a lease is paying off as landlords struggle to find and keep tenants with good credit and a history of paying on time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ask Mike Haskins, a Raleigh, N.C., resident who recently was able to lower his rent. The vacancy rate had risen in his neighborhood after two other apartment complexes had been built. He knew that the complex in which hewas renting wasn't at capacity, and rent for a similar unit on the first floor was set at $650; his rent was $750.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I felt like I had some power," says the 24-year-old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took some pushing -- and a threat to take his business elsewhere -- but before long, Mr. Haskins made a deal. When he renewed his lease, his rent was $100 lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It felt like it was the same experience you go through when getting a car. If you agree to the first thing they offer you, it's probably not the best you're going to get," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are several reasons landlords may be willing to make a deal these days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eighty-eight percent of property owners who participated in a recent <span class="companylink">Rent.com</span> survey said that job losses are contributing to vacancy rates. Fifty percent said would-be tenants can't afford rent or are trying to save, and 45% said the trend of more people doubling up with roommates is causing units to sit vacant. The survey polled owners representing 3,192 apartment communities throughout the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plus, there's even more inventory to compete with these days because in sluggish housing markets many homeowners rent their homes instead of selling, says Peggy Abkemeier, general manager of <span class="companylink">Rent.com</span>. And some renters are becoming homeowners as affordability improves and the government entices them with a first-time buyer tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Mr. Haskins says the first-time buyer credit has him thinking of testing the waters and becoming a homeowner soon. "For my friends who could go either way -- they weren't sure whether they wanted to get a house or not -- that was a final push," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to vacancies, 68% of landlords said they were lowering rents and 68% also said they were giving one or more months of rent free; 38% said they were reducing deposits; and 18% were offering upgrades or allowing more leniency for breaking leases or changing status, according to the <span class="companylink">Rent.com</span> survey. Fifteen percent are offering storage or parking at reduced rates, and 8% are relaxing pet policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another survey, by TransUnion, which screens credit for property-management companies, found that half of property managers are having difficulty locating qualified renters, compared with last year. Eighty-one percent are concerned that they won't find reliable tenants for the rest of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lessors of real estate are earning significantly less so far this year, according to Sageworks, a financial information company. Profits are falling, company research shows, and empty units cost money to maintain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As a renter you tend to have a little leverage these days," says Dan Saklad, chief operating officer of Sageworks. "Sometimes it's as simple as asking -- a lot of times people just don't ask. If you've been renting for a while, you're a known tenant and you're in good standing...they probably will be willing to work with you a little bit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, rental markets do vary, so before you start negotiating make sure you know your market's dynamics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California's East Contra Costa area, for instance, rentals are scarce because there is so much competition among former homeowners who lost their homes in foreclosure, says real-estate agent Lynne Palmer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, there are some markets where the monthly cost of renting is more than the cost of buying a similar place -- before, that is, taking into account property taxes and insurance, and assuming a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage and a down payment of 20% -- according to ZipRealty research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To name a few where ZipRealty says buying is less expensive than renting: Queen Creek, Ariz., Antioch, Calif., Homestead and Kissimmee, Fla., and Henderson, Nev.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're usually areas that have been really hit by foreclosures," says Leslie Tyler, vice president of ZipRealty. "And buying those properties has its own challenges."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some tips on how to bargain in today's rental market:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Know what average rents are in your area, and have an idea of the volume of vacancies in the complex and neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- If you're renegotiating, remind the landlord that by renewing your lease they won't need to find another tenant -- saving them in marketing costs, possible missed rent and any costs of painting and making other improvements required to turn over the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Consider a one-bedroom apartment, if that suits your needs. As many renters double up in two- and three-bedroom apartments, the market might have an extra inventory of one-bedroom units -- allowing for a better bargain, Ms. Abkemeier says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Even with damaged credit, it's not impossible to secure a rental. But you may have to provide a larger security deposit or provide a co-signer on the lease.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Martin Feldstein   </div><div>1160 words</div><div>7 August 2009</div><div>19:10</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An epidemic of mortgage defaults and foreclosures is threatening the economic recovery. The problem is serious and getting worse. More than three million homes are now in serious default (nonpayment for 90 days or more) or foreclosure, nearly double the number a year ago. Sales of properties in foreclosure or serious default made up one third of all home sales in May and June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite a slight uptick in house prices in some markets recently, the sales of foreclosed properties continue to dampen house prices and weaken banks’ balance sheets. The uncertain pace of future losses makes banks nervous about the adequacy of their capital, which discourages bank lending and economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are two separate but mutually reinforcing reasons for the surge in defaults and foreclosures: the reduced affordability of mortgage payments and the high loan-to-value ratios of many houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The affordability problem is the familiar one. Many homeowners become unable to make their payments when they lose their job or have to accept part-time work. Others are unable to cope with the increase in monthly payments that occurs when the interest rates on their adjustable-rate mortgages automatically reset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration is trying to fix the affordability problem by sharing with banks and other creditors the cost of reducing monthly payments to 31% of household income. So far only about 200,000 mortgages have been modified this way, far fewer than the administration’s goal of modifying three million mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More importantly, experience with such mortgage modifications by the FDIC is not promising: Nearly half of all modified mortgages go into default within six months. That’s partly because, even when they can afford the reduced mortgage payments, many homeowners default anyway because they owe more on the house than it is worth. Thanks to this “negative equity,” they just walk away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These defaults happen because in the United States, unlike almost every other country, mortgages are effectively no-recourse loans. If a homeowner defaults, the creditor can take the house but is unable to take other assets or income to make good on the remaining unpaid mortgage balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some states creditors have the legal right to pursue other assets or income. But personal bankruptcy rules limiting what they can take give them little incentive to do so. No-recourse mortgages increase foreclosures, resulting in more properties being thrown on the market, and lead to an excess decline in house prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners are not likely to default if they can afford their monthly payments and if their mortgage is only 10% or 20% more than the value of their house. But when the loan-to-value ratio gets higher, many homeowners do choose to walk away and find another place to rent or buy. Today one-third of all homes with mortgages have mortgage debt that exceeds the value of the home. Among these homeowners, half of the loan-to-value ratios exceed 130%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If home prices continue to decline, this problem will get even worse. Although the recent uptick in some markets provides some hope that house prices are close to the bottom, this improvement may only reflect temporary features such as the sharp drop in mortgage rates in April and May before they bounced back in June and July; the bankers’ recent moratorium on foreclosures that temporarily reduced the supply of new homes for sale; and the introduction of an $8,000 first-time home buyer’s credit. But the risk remains of a continuing downward spiral of house prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama housing plan does not solve the problem of defaults driven by high loan-to-value ratios. Instead the administration has pinned its hopes on lowering mortgage rates to raise house prices and on the Public Private Investment Partnership (PPIP) to remove the high loan-to-value mortgages from the banks’ balance sheets. But mortgage rates have risen and the PPIP is a moribund at best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration should work with creditors and homeowners to reduce the principal on mortgages that are at risk of default. This would not appeal to every homeowner with negative equity, but it may induce enough of them with high loan-to-value mortgages not to default, and thus prevent or reduce the downward spiral of home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here’s how such a plan might work in a way that homeowners and creditors could both welcome, that is fair to taxpayers, and that would help the economy:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any homeowner with a loan-to-value ratio over 120% could apply for a reduction in his mortgage balance. The government and the creditor would then share equally in the cost of writing the loan balance down to 120% of the value of the home. But the homeowner who opts for this write-down would be obliged to convert the remaining mortgage to a loan with full recourse that could not be discharged in bankruptcy. Federal legislation would be needed to modify state mortgage and bankruptcy rules to allow homeowners to obtain the new type of mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An example shows how this would work. Consider someone with a home worth $200,000 and a mortgage of $280,000, i.e., a loan-to-value ratio of 140%. If the borrower and the creditor both agree, the loan could be reduced by $40,000 to $240,000 (120% of the home value.) The government would give the creditor $20,000 to offset half of the write-down. The homeowner would convert the remaining $240,000 mortgage to a bank loan with full recourse that could not be discharged in bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank takes a $20,000 loss (as part of the $40,000 mortgage write-down). But it would be better off, because it has a more legally secure loan of $240,000. The homeowner owes less, but he is now personally responsible to repay the loan in full.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All other homeowners would also benefit from such a plan because reducing defaults stabilizes house prices. Indeed, everyone benefits because with a stabilized housing market the recovery is more secure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this plan succeeds in stabilizing house prices at the present level, the one-time cost to the taxpayers would be capped at $200 billion, even if every homeowner with a loan-to-value ratio over 120% accepted the government-assisted write-down. That $200 billion is less than a 2% fall in house values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slowing the downward spiral of house prices will protect the solvency of the banks and the net worth of households. The failure to do that could mean a deeper and longer recession that imposes much higher costs to the government.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confident that European property markets are recovering, investors are pouring money into Germany's open-ended real-estate funds, which are flush with cash and on the prowl for acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deka Immobilien Investment, a unit of DekaBank AG and Germany's second-largest open-ended property fund manager with assets of €12.5 billion ($18.02 billion) behind Union Investment Real Estate, is in talks to buy an office building in Washington, D.C., and is negotiating the purchase of a logistics center in Prague, according to Matthias Danne, the <span class="companylink">DekaBank</span> board member in charge of overseeing the bank's real-estate business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are interested in buying properties in the best locations. It is possible again to get attractive pricing in central markets in London, Paris, Madrid and other core cities," he said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He declined to elaborate on the negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past few months Deka has done deals valued at more than €500 million. The properties and locations vary widely from a hotel in Göteborg, Sweden, to a logistics center in Waalwijk, Netherlands, to office buildings in Melbourne and Perth, Australia, to its first acquisition in Canada, an office building in Vancouver for €186 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany's open-ended funds have been among the most active European property investors. But many ran for cover last year, when investors stormed the funds seeking their money. Many funds were forced to freeze redemptions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, some of the funds that closed are opening again, and investors are rushing back in. In the first half, net new investment in Germany's open-ended funds was €3.1 billion, according to the fund-management association BVI Bundesverband Investment and Asset Management. New investment is down 24% compared with the first half of 2008, when investors poured €4.13 billion into open-ended property funds. But new investment has been rising month to month since March. The strongest month was June, with €868 million in net new investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The amount of money that has flowed into the open-ended funds largely reverses the outflows that occurred in October and November last year," said Michael Haddock, director of European research at property consultants <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most active property investors among the German funds this year have been the large funds that weren't forced to close when markets plummeted after the collapse of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings</span> last September: Deka, Union Investment Real Estate and Commerz Real Investment. These three fund managers were behind nearly all of the 13 deals done by German property funds this year, with Deka apparently the most active, said Mr. Haddock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with the broader property-investment market, the German funds also are doing larger deals. One-third of the deals this year were valued at more than €100 million, said Mr. Haddock. By comparison, the average size of deals in Europe in the first half was €18 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other recent deals by German open-ended funds include the purchase of a shopping center in Italy by AXA Immoselect, the open-ended property fund of AXA Investment Managers. AXA closed a deal on July 21 to purchase a 90% stake in the Antegnate shopping center in Bergamo, Italy, from the Stilo Group, which will retain the rest and manage the center. AXA, which originally agreed to buy the shopping center in January 2007, said it paid €145 million. A person involved in the deal said that price is lower than agreed in 2007, but AXA also agreed to share profits with Stilo if income from the center is higher than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany's largest open-ended property fund, Union Investment, bought the Auchan shopping center in Monza, Italy, in May for €142 million from Italian property group ImmobiliarEuropea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the open-ended funds that froze redemptions last year are opening again and soon could be back on the acquisition trail. SEB Asset Management, KanAm Grund Kapitalanlagegesellschaft mbH and Credit Suisse Asset Management Immobilien Kapitalanlagegesellschaft mbH are now open again and looking for deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The funds that reopen are likely to take an initial hit from investor withdrawals. SEB saw net withdrawals of €243 million after it opened in June. When July data are published, analysts expect the other funds that reopened will show net withdrawals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">German investors tend to like the open-ended funds because they are meant to produce a steady income stream. To assure consistent dividends to investors, the funds also are required to maintain high levels of liquidity and not take on too much debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of Deka, Mr. Danne said Deka's funds on the whole maintain a low leverage of about 20%. Acquisitions that require debt are financed with as much as 50% equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The German open-ended funds are attracted to prime properties that require little or no follow-on improvements and solid tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They are driven by income," said Mr. Haddock. "The pace of acquisitions will likely pick up in the second half of the year, but it will be more difficult for them to find the kind of prime properties they are looking for."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- The Queens Center Mall doesn't seem to have followed the dour shopping-center story line of this recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales per square foot actually ticked up in 2008 to $876, and year-end occupancy stood at 97.5%. In the food court, 20-year-old shopper Mario Ontaneda, wearing a cap and jeans he purchased from stores in the mall, said: "I need to save up, but I'm constantly buying stuff."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong performance of Queens Center Mall, located in New York's borough of Queens, helps to explain why <span class="companylink">Cadillac Fairview Corp</span>. agreed to pay $150 million and to assume $167 million in mortgage debt to acquire a 49% stake in the mall last week. Cadillac is owned by the <span class="companylink">Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan</span>. <span class="companylink">Macerich Co</span>., the Santa Monica, Calif., real-estate investment trust, sold a stake in the one-million-square-foot mall as part of a broader plan to reduce debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal is among a few early signs that pension funds, a huge source of real-estate capital, are looking at new property investments even as they lick their wounds from past deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A day after the Queens Center deal was announced, the <span class="companylink">California Public Employees' Retirement System</span> said it had closed a $463 million deal to buy a stake in 86 shopping centers around the U.S. from <span class="companylink">Macquarie CountryWide Trust</span> of Australia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Queens Center was Cadillac's first U.S. real-estate purchase since 1999. The company owns about $15 billion of mostly malls and office buildings in Canada, the U.S. and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've looked at, literally, billions of dollars worth of transactions and bid on several of them, but we haven't been successful from a pricing perspective for a long time," Cadillac Vice President of Investments Andrea Stephen said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As property values fall, investors around the world are starting to pay attention to the U.S. market. <span class="companylink">Macerich</span> said it expects to close two more joint ventures in the next two months as the publicly traded real-estate investment trust tries to reduce its $7.9 billion debt load. Chief Executive Art Coppola said in a conference call on Tuesday that a big U.S. pension fund and an international sovereign-wealth fund are the lead contenders to join those ventures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dropping property values and rising stock markets also are giving institutional investors like <span class="companylink">Cadillac Fairview</span> more flexibility in making new real-estate investments. In the wake of the stock-market crisis last fall, many institutional investors were trying to reduce their exposure to real estate because of the "denominator effect." With equity portfolios losing value, and appraisers slow to mark down commercial property, some pension funds and college endowments found themselves with more real estate on their books than the percentage approved by their boards. Now, with stocks up and real estate down, that balance is starting to move back in line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Deals that make sense are pretty few and far between," said Martin Rosenberg of real-estate investment consultant Townsend Group. But "with the denominator effect abating, a lot of investors are working to find targeted ways to put capital to work today and to position capital to be deployed quickly as pressure on sellers continues to build."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The danger is moving too soon. Few commercial real-estate transactions are getting done, not only because they are hard to finance but also because it is unclear how much further the market will fall. Before last week's transactions, there had been only three retail deals of more than $100 million this year, according to research firm <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. By this time in 2008, there had been 15 such deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said <span class="companylink">Macerich</span> got a decent price, selling the stake in Queens Center to longtime partner <span class="companylink">Cadillac Fairview</span> at a capitalization rate just over 7%. Real-estate participants have been warning that the cap rate -- annual net income divided by purchase price, a measure of how the market values real estate -- could hit double digits for some properties as distressed landlords are forced to sell.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. consumer spending climbed in June, but the gain seems to have been driven by rising gasoline prices. Meanwhile, the income of Americans took the largest tumble in four years during June, reflecting the rising unemployment that is challenging the economy as it struggles out of recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal income decreased at a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.3% from the month before, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Wages and salaries as well as transfer payments both fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop, the biggest since the 2.3% decline in January 2005, was a payback for May income increasing 1.3%. Federal-government stimulus of the economy had driven the surge, involving a large sum of transfer payments, including temporary benefits for older people. The 1.3% gain marked a revision downward from an originally reported 1.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending increased 0.4% from the prior month. Adjusting for inflation, though, spending dipped by 0.1%. U.S. Energy Department data show retail gasoline hit a 2009 peak, at $2.69 a gallon, during the week ended June 22. The last time inflation-adjusted spending rose was in February, up 0.1%, echoing recent reports on lackluster spending by consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending in May rose 0.1%, revised downward from an originally reported 0.3% gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disposable personal income -- income after taxes -- fell by 1.3% in June. Disposable income rose 1.6% during May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without government support, personal income is under pressure as the U.S. workweek gets shorter. In a report showing that the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 9.5% in June, the Labor Department said the average workweek for production and nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls fell by six minutes to 33 hours -- the lowest since records began in 1964.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bad job market is endangering a U.S. recovery. A key report last week said the economy contracted from April through June by 1%, much less than over the winter. But the data showed consumer spending decelerated in the spring, and spending is a big part of the economy. While analysts foresee the economy rising in the current, third quarter, fear for jobs will likely keep wallets tight and hinder the expected growth during the rest of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data Tuesday showed that personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income was 4.6% in June, the Commerce Department said. It was 6.2% in May, 4.7% in April and 3.7% during March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An important price gauge eased in June. The price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, year over year, rose 1.5%, after climbing 1.6% in May. The Federal Reserve watches this core index closely for signs of inflation pressures. Fed officials define their statutory goal of price stability as inflation of 1.5% to 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The core index increased 0.2% in June compared with May after rising 0.1% in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But inflation watchers remain vigilant. The Fed and the federal government have pumped out a lot of money to revive the economy. The efforts could backfire, unlocking inflation and pushing interest rates higher.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sara Murray </div><div>678 words</div><div>5 August 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists are predicting a brighter second half of the year as the cash-for-clunkers program boosts spending and U.S. manufacturers ramp up their production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revisions began after last week's gross-domestic-product report, showing the economy contracted at a better-than-expected 1%. This week, the upward revisions have continued on hopes the government's auto stimulus program would propel consumer spending in coming months and force auto makers to make more new cars than previously planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said Tuesday that consumer spending rose 0.4% in June. But adjusted for inflation, it fell 0.1%. Personal-income data also fell 1.3% in June, the largest single-month drop in four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data indicated that consumers concluded the first half under intense pressure from a weak labor market. That suggests the anticipated GDP growth won't be enough to substantially bring down the unemployment rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, in the largest wave of upward revisions of GDP forecasts since the financial crisis began, UBS AG is now predicting 2.5% growth in the third quarter, up from 2%, and 3% growth in the fourth quarter, up from 2.5%. <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp;Co</span>. also revised its third-quarter forecast to 3% growth, up from 2.2%. For the fourth quarter, it is now predicting 2.0%, up from 1.6%. <span class="companylink">T. Rowe Price Group Inc</span>. increased its third-quarter projection to 2.75% from 1.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists already had expected growth to rebound in coming months after companies drew down inventories in the first half of the year. A promising manufacturing report this week showed a jump in new orders and production, building on those expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you combine leaner inventories with more sales, that's the fundamental reason for being more optimistic about at least the second half of this year," said Mark Zandi, chief economist for <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. The firm revised its third-quarter forecast to 1.6% from 1.1%, and its fourth-quarter outlook to 2.1% from 0.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the cash-for-clunkers program receives an additional $2 billion in funding from Congress, sales could boost consumer spending even further, said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>. It would likely cause another drop in the personal savings rate, which fell to 4.6% in June from 6.2% a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, MFR Inc. chief economist Joshua Shapiro said, "The underlying fundamentals for the consumer are going to remain pretty tough" once they aren't benefiting from government programs. Mr. Shapiro originally predicted 0.2% growth in the third quarter and no growth in the fourth quarter, but said now 2% growth is likely in the second half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the cash-for-clunkers program expires, consumers are likely to rein in spending once again, and the savings rate is expected to continue its climb in the long run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Typically, when we see incentive-driven gains in motor vehicle sales, there's been a huge payback once the program ended," Mr. Vitner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best-case scenario for sustained growth is a strong second half, with improved consumer spending and confidence, and without the massive layoffs that have marked much of the recession. Short of that, business investment would have to make a comeback for expansion to continue. New orders are showing encouraging signs, but so far there's little sign the growth is widespread.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although housing isn't expected to lead the recovery, signs of improvement in the sector could buoy growth in the economy. The pending home-sales index, which measures housing contract activity and is designed to foreshadow existing home sales, increased 3.6% in June to 94.6 -- its highest point since June 2007, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday. The measure suggests that existing home sales are likely to rise in the next month or two, though the relationship between the two indicators has been volatile lately.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael S. Derby and Emily Barrett   </div><div>442 words</div><div>4 August 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>C7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond prices got slammed Monday in the wake of positive news about factory and construction spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data helped reaffirm a consensus the U.S. economy is emerging from the sharpest recession of the postwar period. No part of the Treasury curve was left unscathed, although intermediate-dated securities fared the worst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management reported factory output in the U.S., though still not exactly gearing up, is no longer contracting as fast as it was. The headline index of activity rose to 48.9 from 44.8 in June, beating the forecast of 46.5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Readings under 50 still signal activity is shrinking, so July's report isn't a full rebound, but it does suggest the sector, often considered a leading indicator for the rest of the economy, is making a turnaround.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It would be difficult to convince many manufacturers that we are on the brink of recovery, but the data suggests that we will see growth in the third quarter if the trends continue," said Norbert Ore, who directs the survey for the ISM.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report included encouraging signs for future activity with a rise in the new-orders index, too. But hiring remains weak, with that reading rising modestly to 45.6, from 40.7 the month before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pressure created by the ISM data was joined by government data showing a boost for the construction industry. Spending on U.S. building projects rose 0.3% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $965.66 billion. Wall Street had anticipated a 0.5% decline. The comparison is still dire, though, with spending down 10% in June from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists were largely cheered by the reports. And because Treasury bonds, a haven investment, do best when times are bad, the two reports were a recipe for a selloff. Bonds also were weighed down by rising stock prices, which further strip Treasurys' luster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late Monday in New York, the 10-year note was down 1 4/32 points, or $11.25 per $1,000 face value, at 95 25/32. Its yield rose to 3.641% from 3.501% late Friday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond was down 1 26/32 points to yield 4.422%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the coming days promise to be less eventful, the summer lull may mean continued volatility, as low trading volumes tend to exaggerate price swings.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in the U.S. manufacturing sector continued to ease in July as factories boosted output, an early sign that manufacturers and the overall economy are likely to grow in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An increase in new orders and production -- and a slight improvement in employment -- propelled the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index to 48.9 last month, up from 44.8 in June. It's the seventh straight monthly increase, but still short of the 50 level that indicates growth in the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're getting very near the end of the recession as far as manufacturing is concerned," said Norbert Ore, chairman of the ISM's manufacturing survey of purchase managers, on Monday. But he said U.S. gross domestic product needs to expand at a rate of more than 2% for manufacturing to grow at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week's GDP figures, showing the economy contracted at a 1% rate in the second quarter, prompted analysts to revise their third-quarter projections upward. <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span> raised its third-quarter GDP forecast to 2% from zero growth in response to the new data on GDP, which measures output. UBS AG's forecast rose to 2.5% from 2%, and <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co</span>. predicted a heftier 3% growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts viewed the report as the latest sign that the economy has turned around. "The July ISM report is the clearest indication yet that the recession ended in either May or June," RDQ Economics' John Ryding wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the industries that tend to be leaders in recession recovery -- housing and automobiles -- are struggling and could continue to weigh on demand, Mr. Ore said. Although the manufacturing sector is now expected to show growth as early as the report for August, he said its members are bracing for a slow recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're not looking at a strong GDP growth [rate] for a long period of time, which is what it really takes to replace manufacturing jobs," Mr. Ore said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The employment component of the index rose to 45.6 from 40.7 last month, but some members cautioned that more layoffs were on the horizon. More optimistic manufacturers said they were adding temporary workers to respond to the increase in new orders, which would be the first sign of a turnaround in hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An ISM subindex for new orders rose to 55.3, its highest point since July 2007, and the production gauge climbed more than five points to 57.9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another positive sign for third-quarter growth, construction spending improved in June, climbing 0.3% to nearly $966 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, the Commerce Department said Monday. Residential spending grew 0.7%, and nonresidential, primarily boosted by spending on public projects, rose 0.1%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael S. Derby and Emily Barrett </div><div>568 words</div><div>4 August 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond prices got slammed Monday in the wake of positive news about factory and construction spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data helped reaffirm a consensus the U.S. economy is emerging from the sharpest recession of the postwar period. No part of the Treasury curve was left unscathed, although intermediate-dated securities fared the worst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management reported factory output in the U.S., though still not exactly gearing up, is no longer contracting as fast as it was. The headline index of activity rose to 48.9 from 44.8 in June, beating the forecast of 46.5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Readings under 50 still signal activity is shrinking, so July's report isn't a full rebound, but it does suggest the sector, often considered a leading indicator for the rest of the economy, is making a turnaround.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It would be difficult to convince many manufacturers that we are on the brink of recovery, but the data suggests that we will see growth in the third quarter if the trends continue," said Norbert Ore, who directs the survey for the ISM.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report included encouraging signs for future activity with a rise in the new-orders index, too. But hiring remains weak, with that reading rising modestly to 45.6, from 40.7 the month before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pressure created by the ISM data was joined by government data showing a boost for the construction industry. Spending on U.S. building projects rose 0.3% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $965.66 billion. Wall Street had anticipated a 0.5% decline. The comparison is still dire, though, with spending down 10% in June from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists were largely cheered by the reports. And because Treasury bonds, a haven investment, do best when times are bad, the two reports were a recipe for a selloff. Bonds also were weighed down by rising stock prices, which further strip Treasurys' luster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late Monday in New York, the 10-year note was down 1 4/32 points, or $11.25 per $1,000 face value, at 95 25/32. Its yield rose to 3.641% from 3.501% late Friday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond was down 1 26/32 points to yield 4.422%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the coming days promise to be less eventful, the summer lull may mean continued volatility, as low trading volumes tend to exaggerate price swings.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. factory sector continued its slow but steady trek out of the recession in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management reported Monday that activity showed a reduced rate of contraction, with its manufacturing index standing at 48.9, from 44.8 in June and 42.8 in May. The index had been seen at 46.5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Readings under 50 signal that activity is shrinking, so July's report doesn't signal a return to health for this key sector of the economy. That said, the index has been on the mend for much of the year, booking less negative readings, on a path that could soon see factory activity once again in expansion mode.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It would be difficult to convince many manufacturers that we are on the brink of recovery, but the data suggest that we will see growth in the third quarter if the trends continue," said Norbert Ore, who directs the survey for the ISM.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The factory sector is particularly important because activity there often leads the broader economy. The ISM report arrives at a time where many policy makers and private-sector economists see an end to the recession coming into view, even though few expect to see a robust rebound follow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of what underpins confidence in the recovery is the belief that after such a deep pullback, inventories of many types of goods will need to be restocked. That argues for increased factory output, and as such, the improvement in the ISM manufacturing index suggests this process may be happening now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the report, the ISM found notable improvements. The July production index was 57.9, from 52.5. while the new-orders index was 55.3, versus June's 49.2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hiring was still weak, however, with that reading at 45.6, from 40.7 the month before. Inventories shrank at a slower pace, at 33.5, after the prior month's 30.8 reading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation, a topic of worry for many, was higher. The prices index for July came in at 55.0. It had been at 50.0 in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, spending on U.S. construction projects unexpectedly rose in June, making its second increase in three months as signs of a recovery emerge in the housing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total spending climbed by 0.3% from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $965.66 billion, the Commerce Department said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street had expected overall spending on construction would decrease, falling by 0.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial construction spending inched higher. Public-sector construction spending rose to an all-time high. Spending fell 0.8% in May; originally, May spending was seen 0.9% lower. Spending in June was down 10.2% from June 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">June residential construction spending climbed 0.7% to $253.8 billion. Residential spending fell 3.2% in May, a revision up from the originally reported decrease of 3.5% for the month. Spending in April rose 1.5%. Year over year, residential spending was 29.3% below the June 2008 level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New evidence suggests the housing market is beginning to recover from its long crisis. Sales of single-family homes rose 11% in June, the U.S. government said last week. It was the fourth increase in six months. Stronger demand has emboldened builders; home construction unexpectedly rose in June, up by 3.6%. Building permits also climbed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's data said nonresidential construction spending increased 0.1% during June. Outlays climbed for roads and amusement parks and fell for hotels. Year over year, spending for commercial construction was down 0.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big fall is expected in commercial construction. In parts of the U.S., office vacancy rates are up. Rents are down. Credit is tight. The Federal Reserve's latest "beige book" review of the economy described commercial real-estate leasing markets as either "weak" or "slow" in all regions of the U.S.; the severity of the downturn varied somewhat, depending on the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending in the private sector during June decreased by 0.1% to $643.9 billion. Spending fell 1.4% in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending by the government on construction rose a fifth straight month in June -- even though the economy's slump has cost municipalities money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government revenues have fallen because of rising unemployment, which cuts into income taxes, and falling home values, which eats up property taxes. Companies have seen business drop in the recession, meaning they're paying less in taxes to the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1.0% gain in June public-sector construction spending, to $321.7 billion, followed a May climb of 0.4%. Federal government construction outlays surged 1.9% in June. State and local spending, which is much larger than federal spending in dollars, increased by 1.0%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Larry Light   </div><div>846 words</div><div>3 August 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While housing may be nearing a bottom, commercial real estate likely has much further to fall. And that could snuff out a significant rally in real-estate-investment-trust stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs, which own everything from office buildings to strip malls, have seen their shares rocket 60% since hitting an 18-year low on March 6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now REITs face at least two years of crushing debt maturities, sliding property values, dwindling occupancy and weakening earnings. These are major obstacles for their shares to overcome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs, which took off in the early 1990s when many private-property owners went public, used to be pitched as something in between a stock and a bond. Over time, most of the gains investors get from REITS come from their high dividends. And REITs pay no corporate income tax as long as they pay 90% of taxable income to investors as dividends. But, in the short run, REITs have turned out to be surprisingly volatile. The sector lost 57% from last Sept. 30 to March 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot of the current market rebound stems from relief that the dire forecasts for REITs in late 2008 and early 2009 didn't come true. Thus far, <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties Inc</span>., a debt-laden mall owner, is the lone big REIT to file for bankruptcy. Many REITs improved their financial standing by cutting dividends and raising fresh equity capital, further heartening the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those moves mightn't be enough in light of the challenges ahead. "Additional shocks are coming over the next six to 12 months," says Robert Arnott, chairman of financial strategy firm Research Affiliates LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs must refinance a daunting $152 billion in debt through 2013. Some REITs have crushing debt levels, such as office landlord Maguire Properties, with 94% debt to capital. Anything much above 60% is considered onerous. Another office REIT, <span class="companylink">Kilroy Realty</span>, has had tenant outflows that have whittled away its occupancy rate to near 85% -- the minimum level allowable under its loan covenants. Kilroy had to get its banks to waive them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, some REITs could still do well, even if the sector as a whole suffers. Green Street Advisors, a REIT research firm, notes that some trusts sport strong fundamentals that should make them long-term winners: <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group</span> in regional malls, <span class="companylink">Avalon Bay Communities</span> in apartments and <span class="companylink">Liberty Property Trust</span> in offices and industrial. Although all three have seen tenant occupancy slip, their debt loads are at a comfortable 50% of capital or slightly below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bullish view on REITs is that many of them have gone through the worst, and 2010 should mark an upturn. The spate of recent capital raisings "bought them time to get through the recession," says Tom Bohjalian, senior vice president at Cohen &amp; Steers, a real-estate investment firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a whole, however, the sector doesn't look cheap any more. A big reason to buy REITs, their superior dividend yields, has worn away, thanks to rising share prices. In the spring, yields averaged around 10%, says researcher SNL Financial. Now they are down to 4.7%, below many investment-grade corporate bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite REITs' current rise, the Dow Jones Composite REIT Index is still down almost two-thirds from its February 2007 peak. Owing to a horrendous first quarter of 2009, REITs are off 5.2% year-to date, versus a 4.5% gain for the Dow Jone Industrial Average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"REITs have out-performed recently, but off a very low bottom," says Ross Smotrich, head of REIT research at <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>. In the winter, he says, "the stocks were trading as if the REITs were all going insolvent."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs have received nowhere near the federal support that the financial-services industry has enjoyed. A Federal Reserve program offering financial backing for debt, called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, has just started for commercial real estate. Even though some big REITs like Vornado and Developers Diversified are expected to benefit from the program, some others are too leveraged to qualify under the Fed's standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, commercial-property owners have dimmer prospects for recovery than their residential brethren. The long housing slump has shown signs of ending, with home prices in many markets nudging up lately, partly because residential real estate now offers so many bargains. REITs, however, operate on tougher terrain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike houses, whose mortgage terms typically are 15 or 30 years, REIT debt often matures after three to seven years and must be rolled over -- hard to do when credit is tight. Only four REITs have issued unsecured debt this year, according to Fitch Ratings, paying pricey yields between 7% and 10.75%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing stocks peaked in 2005 and REITs in February 2007, so REITs have two more years in their recovery cycle," says Samuel Lieber, president of Alpine Woods Capital Investors LLC, an asset manager that invests in real estate.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anton Troianovski   </div><div>1003 words</div><div>31 July 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOENIX -- Along a 15-mile stretch of desert, amid strip malls and unfinished subdivisions, nearly a dozen giant warehouses sit silent and empty. They are relics of this city's dream of becoming a national warehouse hub, a vision dashed by plunging imports and a reordering of the nation's biggest ports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decisions to site these warehouses were made earlier this decade as Americans were buying so many new cars, televisions and T-shirts that California -- the gateway for many Asian imports -- was running out of cheap storage space. With cash from pension funds and other investors, developers sought to turn the desert on the city's west side into a distribution hub, 370 miles from Los Angeles ports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, an empty, half-mile-long warehouse lingers from that vision. The building's 1.2 million square feet could fit 193 full-size copies of the Statue of Liberty. Its parking lot has room for 292 tractor trailers. But on a recent morning the only signs of life were a security guard's trailer, golf cart and bicycle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not a pretty story," says developer Jonathan Tratt, who has spent more than a year unsuccessfully trying to find a tenant for the building. He is now offering short-term leases in a bid to ride out the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tratt's warehouse is one of 11 storage complexes completed in southwest Phoenix in 2008, with two more set to be finished this year. Those 13 properties combined will have eight million square feet and are now 86% empty, according to brokerage <span class="companylink">Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc</span>. The construction boom has driven the industrial vacancy rate in the 47 million-square-foot southwest Phoenix market to over 20%, according to brokerage <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most owners of the empty buildings said they aren't panicking yet. The local market will inevitably absorb the space, they believe. "I'm optimistic the year won't end as bleak as it started," Cushman &amp; Wakefield broker Bo Mills said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New warehouses also sprang up in, among other places, California's Inland Empire east of Los Angeles. In total, U.S. developers built more industrial real estate during the boom than office buildings or retail space, as measured by square footage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>. estimates that 608 million square feet of industrial space was completed in the U.S. between 2001 and 2008. Southwest Phoenix's industrial space alone climbed 34%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Phoenix, developers face headwinds beyond the drop in global trade. Shippers are increasingly turning to ports in Georgia, Virginia and Florida to transport goods bound east of the Mississippi, while space in the Inland Empire -- much closer to Los Angeles -- has become abundant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Instead of being the beneficiary of its location between Southern California ports and the East, Phoenix has become the victim," said Jeff Shell, head of corporate finance for real-estate brokerage <span class="companylink">Grubb &amp; Ellis Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Feeding the commercial space boom were publicly traded real-estate investments trusts and private-equity funds that funneled cash from pension funds, endowments and other investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 2001 through 2008, some $5.6 billion in industrial property deals were done here, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The winners were those who flipped properties rather than held onto them. Chicago-based First Industrial Realty Trust, for instance, turned a $60 million profit on land deals here as the market grew frothy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was better to take the money off the table and make a nice profit with no risk," said Kevin Czerwinski, head of First Industrial's Phoenix office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a 2005 deal, Mr. Czerwinski paid $14 million for 300 acres of land 25 miles from Phoenix. Three months later, he sold the parcel for $24 million to a California developer, Voit Real Estate Services. Voit held on to the land for about a year before selling it to <span class="companylink">Duke Realty Corp</span>., an Indianapolis property company, for $36 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Duke Realty and SunCor Development Co., a subsidiary of Phoenix energy giant <span class="companylink">Pinnacle West Capital Corp</span>., are among the developers stuck with big chunks of empty space. In Goodyear, 25 miles west of Phoenix, SunCor's year-old, 400,000- square-foot warehouse features palm trees and rustic architecture but no tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the height of the frenzy, Phoenix brokers said, investors agreed to buy an empty warehouse for more than it cost to build it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is how LBA Realty, an Irvine, Calif., investment firm, ended up paying a reported $73 million for a four-building, 1.1-million square-foot complex early last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it is how ING Clarion Partners, the New York real-estate-investment unit of Dutch financial giant <span class="companylink">ING Groep N.V</span>., ended up paying $44 million for a new, 700,000-square-foot complex around the same time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The properties are both mostly empty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is some life in this warehouse desert. Duke erected a huge warehouse complex on the land it bought from First Industrial and <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span> took one of the buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rest remain empty. A blank sign surrounded by landscaped shrubbery faces South Cotton Lane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four miles from the security guard's trailer, another 1.2-million square-foot storage building is almost complete and hasn't signed any tenants. The warehouse is part of a three-building, $150 million deal that a Utah state employees' pension fund tentatively reached with closely held developer Buzz Oates Enterprises in early 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunes in these parts change quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First Industrial's Mr. Czerwinski, once a high flier in the property world, has seen his office staff cut to four from 13.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His company's stock traded at $4.19 Thursday, down from a high of $33.17 last fall, as investors realize that the huge profits the company produced through land plays and development aren't as stable as old-fashioned rent collecting.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in major U.S. cities registered the first monthly gain in nearly three years, according to a new report that provided fresh evidence that the severe U.S. housing downturn could be easing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller index, which tracks home prices in 20 metropolitan areas, rose 0.5% for the three-month period ending in May, compared with the three months ending in April. It marked the index's first increase after 34 straight months of decline, and came after a variety of housing indicators has shown glimmers of hope for the past several months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices remained down about 17% from a year earlier, according to the index. According to S&amp;P/Case-Schiller's seasonally adjusted numbers, which it began reporting only earlier this year, prices in May posted a 0.2% decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most Wall Street economists who discussed the survey focused on the April-to-May rise, saying it represents a significant change in direction. Home prices in 15 of the 20 areas in the survey rose or remained stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results were also consistent with other recent housing data, these economists said. Sales of new and existing homes rose for three consecutive months through June. Housing starts were up in June, and an index of builder sentiment rose in July, though both remained at low levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May's uptick came in part as home prices in some areas fell enough for investors and first-time buyers to begin competing for bargains, helping to ease the backlog of unsold homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other likely sales spurs included mortgage rates that fell to 50-year lows, an $8,000 federal-tax credit for first-time homebuyers and the ability of buyers to secure mortgages from the Federal Housing Administration with as little as 3.5% down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest readings don't necessarily herald a full-blown recovery for the housing market or broader economy. Consumer confidence remains near record lows. The U.S. unemployment rate, at 9.5% in June, is expected to hit double digits before year end, making swift growth and an expanding labor force unlikely anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-sale numbers surprised Robert Shiller, the Yale University economist who helped create the Case-Shiller indexes. "The change in momentum here is very significant," he said. Last month, Mr. Shiller forecast sustained home-price declines into the next few years, which he said now looks less plausible. He said he expects home prices to remain near current levels for the next five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices have fallen by about one-third since their peak in the second quarter of 2006, according to S&amp;P, and are roughly back at 2003 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts warn that the home-price uptick could reverse as rising unemployment causes more Americans to fall behind on their mortgage payments and end up in foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One factor that apparently drove the March-through-May uptick was a falling share of homes sold at distressed prices, through foreclosure and so-called short sales. Distressed sales accounted for 33% of existing home sales in May and 31% in June, down from a high of nearly 50% earlier this year, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in foreclosure sales was likely the product of U.S. banks' moratorium on home foreclosures, which they undertook as the government launched a round of programs to modify and refinance loans for at-risk borrowers. Most banks ended their foreclosure moratoria in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates also hovered at or below 5% for most of the March-May period, before rising in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Were it not for those rate reductions and the moratorium, you'd see prices down right now," says Ronald Temple, co-Director of Research at <span class="companylink">Lazard Asset Management</span>. He expects the index to stabilize or increase in the short-term, but forecasts another 12-15% decline in prices thereafter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless, a combination of still-low interest rates and eager sellers continues to fuel competition for heavily discounted properties. Some buyers are finding that investors with all-cash offers are consistently beating them in bidding wars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stacy Watson, a 39-year-old human-resources manager in the Riverside, Calif., area, says she has made losing bids on at least eight homes since mid-June. On Tuesday, she says, she decided to increase her offer for a five-bedroom home in Perris, Calif., to $198,000, nearly $20,000 more than the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Watson and her real-estate agent say the bank-owned home has drawn more than 10 offers in less than a week on the market. "Everyone says it's such a great housing market for buyers," she says. "No. This is hard."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would-be homeowners have benefited from government programs, including one that allows buyers of properties owned by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> to receive mortgages from the government-controlled mortgage-finance company with down payments as low as 3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Nelly Whiteman and her husband recently bought a house out of foreclosure from <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, she figures they competed against at least two other buyers. The 27-year-old administrative assistant says they snagged their three-bedroom home in Orangevale, Calif., for $176,000, or about $5,000 more than the asking price. They now pay about $1,080 a month in mortgage payments, insurance and taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's an extra bedroom for around what we were paying for rent," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The budding housing recovery isn't being felt across the country. Prices increased in 13 of 20 surveyed markets, with the strongest gains coming in Cleveland, up 4.1% from April; Dallas, up 1.9%; and Boston, up 1.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices were flat in the New York and Tampa, Fla., areas. The survey doesn't track condominium or cooperative apartment sales, so it doesn't take into account the majority of housing stock in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices continue to fall in some markets, particularly overbuilt Sunbelt cities. Prices in Las Vegas declined 2.6% in May from April and were down 32% from a year ago, according to S&amp;P/Case-Shiller. Phoenix prices declined 0.9% from April and were down 34% from May 2008. San Francisco, Miami and Detroit also continued to see year-on-year declines of about 25%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Is this just a spring bounce that was partly related to the drop in distressed sales?" asks Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist based in Leesburg, Va. One key question, he says, is whether another wave of foreclosures could come along to offset the home-inventory decline that has boosted many markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many of the hardest-hit cities, banks appear to be slow to put foreclosed homes on the market. In Las Vegas, for example, banks had taken title to 13,200 homes as of June. That surpassed the total number of homes listed for sale in Las Vegas last month, according to SalesTraq, which monitors inventory in Las Vegas. "Are the banks are intentionally holding back inventory? That's a question a lot of us have," says Larry Murphy, president of SalesTraq.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some housing analysts say they expect falling prices on mid-to high-end homes to weigh on the Case-Shiller index. The supply of these homes has swelled in recent months as borrowers struggle to obtain financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers of "jumbo" mortgages, which are too big for government backing, face higher rates. Banks are also requiring bigger down-payments at a time when traditional "trade-up" buyers are finding that the equity in their homes has fallen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think [the sales index] will look like a 'W,' where prices go up until the foreclosures at the higher end translate into another leg lower," says Ivy Zelman, chief executive of Zelman &amp; Associates, a housing-research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improvement in housing likely gave a small boost to U.S. gross domestic product in the second quarter, economists said. After data showed construction of new homes was stronger than expected in June and was revised higher in April and May, <span class="companylink">Macroeconomic Advisers</span>, a St. Louis-based forecasting group, ratcheted up its estimate of second-quarter economic growth. It now sees output shrinking at just a 0.5% annual rate in the second quarter, compared with declines of 6.3% and 5.5% in the previous two quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government will report its official estimate of second-quarter growth on Friday.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. government will report on Friday how the economy performed in the second quarter, and economists expect it will say the economy contracted at about a 1.5% annual rate, marking the fourth consecutive decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That typically would be seen as bad news -- but not after gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services produced by the economy, shrank by 6.3% in the fourth quarter and 5.5% in first, causing many economists to worry about the possibility of a depression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Policy makers seem to have collectively succeeded and we're going to avoid the big 'D,'" says Robert Barbera, an economist at research and trading firm ITG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most economists think that U.S. consumers and businesses continued to cut back on spending in the second quarter. But consumers trimmed their spending by much less than they did in the fourth quarter, when the financial crisis came to a head. And businesses cut less than they did in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this augurs well for the current quarter, which began July 1. Economists expect to see GDP nudge higher this quarter, reinforcing a sense that the recession that began in December 2007 is at or near its end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, new-home sales soared in June, according a U.S. government report released Monday, supplying fresh evidence the housing market is beginning to recover from its long crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes rose 11% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 384,000 compared with the prior month, the Commerce Department said Monday. Wall Street expected a 2.3% gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase was the fourth in six months. Sales probably reached a bottom in January, at a level of 329,000. Although down 21% since June 2008, sales are up nearly 17% from that January low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With more investors coming to believe that the beginning of an economic recovery is approaching, stocks have been advancing. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average cleared 9000 for the first time since the beginning of the year, putting it 39% above its March low point. Surveys show that consumer and business attitudes also have improved markedly from earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You had a shock to confidence, but as you got into the second quarter, the fear factor began to fade," says <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> economist Michael Feroli. "That broke the free fall."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, bank lending continues to slow as borrowers refrain from taking risks, a bearish sign for the economy. The total amount of loans held by 15 large U.S. banks shrank by 2.8% in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A favorable -- or at least less negative -- GDP report may advance the credibility of President Barack Obama's stimulus plan, says Tom Gallagher, a Washington-based analyst with Wall Street research firm ISI Group. It fuels the White House argument that the stimulus is working, with a lag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Feroli expects the government's Bureau of Economic Analysis to report that the economy contracted at a 1% annual rate in the second quarter. But like many other economists, he thinks businesses sharply reduced inventories in the second quarter. Because they were selling goods they already had on hand, they produced less, and that reduced GDP. Absent the effect of falling inventories, Mr. Feroli thinks that GDP would be flat. Excluding inventory changes, GDP fell at a 6.2% annual rate in the fourth quarter and by 3.3% in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GDP predictions from Wall Street economists polled on July 24 by Dow Jones Newswires range from a 2% contraction to 0.7% growth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Memo to those wondering when the housing slump will end: It depends on where you live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal’s latest quarterly survey of housing-related data shows that the market for residential real estate is healing at varying speeds in different parts of the country. The Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., and many areas in California that are near employment centers have shown signs of stabilizing, housing analysts say, while the outlook in other places—much of Florida, Detroit and Las Vegas—still appears bleak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday morning’s report from the National Association of Realtors on June home sales is sure to inflame the debate on whether the housing market is bottoming, but clear answers are likely to remain elusive—partly because of the variations in performance around the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, home sales were up sharply from the depressed year-earlier levels in Orlando, Minneapolis, Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area, according to reports from local Realtor groups and MDA <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>, a research firm. But sales dropped 50% in Manhattan, according to Miller Samuel Inc., a New York-based appraisal firm. Sales also declined in Long Island, N.Y., and Charlotte, N.C., among other areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A flood of foreclosed homes sold by banks over the past year has crushed prices of low- to mid-range houses down to levels that attract investors and first-time buyers in some areas, notably parts of California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Amy Musial, who manages a <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> in Sacramento buying a house became “a no-brainer” this spring once she and her husband realized that their monthly payments would be slightly lower than the rent they had been paying on a two-bedroom apartment. They paid about $229,000 for a three-bedroom house that had been through a foreclosure. Several years ago, the same house could have sold for more than $350,000, estimates Shelley Hescock, the real-estate agent who represented the Musials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But prices of higher-end homes around the country have been slower to fall because there have been fewer foreclosure sand other forced sales of such properties. That is changing as more owners of fancy homes lose jobs, fall behind on mortgages or chop asking prices to realistic levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At both the high and low ends of the market, there are still plenty of reasons for caution. Rising unemployment is removing potential buyers and turning others into sellers. Credit remains tight. Appraisers have become more conservative and their estimates are causing many potential sales to fall through. Large numbers of foreclosed homes are likely to weigh on the market for at least another year or two. And a federal tax credit of as much as $8,000 for first-time home buyers ends Nov. 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People are being more conservative with what they’re buying,” says Matthew Montgomery, a real-estate agent at Hammond Residential who works in the Boston suburbs of Newton and Brookline, Mass. In general, he adds, “the bigger the house, the harder it is to sell.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Washington, D.C., area, government-related employment has held up and helped revive housing demand, says Jody Kahn, an analyst at John Burns Real Estate Consulting, a research firm. “Good locations in Alexandria and Fairfax [Va.] are seeing some emerging price stability and even small increases,” Ms. Kahn says, and Maryland’s Montgomery County “is showing price stability.” More remote suburbs will take longer to recover, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, San Diego and Sacramento both have become much more affordable, she says. Ms. Kahn also thinks prospects are relatively good in Denver; Raleigh, N.C.; San Jose, Calif.; and the Texas cities of Austin and San Antonio—areas that generally avoided the housing bubble and so don’t have as much need to adjust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist in Leesburg, Va., says areas that seem to be nearing stability include San Diego, Sacramento, Minneapolis, Boston and the Virginia suburbs of Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among metro areas that “still have a long road to recovery” are Detroit, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Miami-Fort Lauderdale and Chicago, says Ms. Kahn. Mr. Lawler includes New York, Seattle and Portland, among others, in this category. Problems in these areas include high unemployment and large numbers of vacant homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, there are lots of variations within metro areas. The most appealing neighborhoods, offering short commutes and good schools, may vastly outperform marginal areas that thrived during the boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The job market outlook is a major wild card for those seeking to divine the direction of house prices. Looking ahead one year, <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> Economy.com sees the metro areas of Washington, Minneapolis, Houston and Dallas among those likely to have unemployment rates below the national average. Those expected to be above the national average include Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, Orlando, Sacramento and Portland, Ore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unemployment may be the most important factor in assessing a metro area’s housing-market prospects, says Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> Economy.com. “If people don’t have jobs or fear losing their jobs ,then buying homes is out of the question,” he says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Barry Newman </div><div>1282 words</div><div>21 July 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- What goes up must come down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a question New Yorkers start asking the minute a truck pulls up to the front door and guys in hardhats jump out and start whacking together a sidewalk shed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sidewalk sheds consist of pipes, beams, planks and plywood. They can be a few feet or a few hundred feet long, and they make it possible to walk in New York without getting beaned by bricks falling off buildings. The bricks land on the sheds instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the real-estate boom, New York had between 4,000 and 6,000 sidewalk sheds. During the real-estate bust, New York still has between 4,000 and 6,000 sidewalk sheds. Construction sites have gone dark, but facades keep buckling and cornices keep cracking as if nothing had happened to the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shed builders may be the only busy hardhats left in town. In some cities, sidewalk sheds go up when work is in progress. In New York, especially if landlords are broke, sheds go up and stay up because work is making no progress. Good times or bad, the sidewalk shed is one of those things that make New York New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're ugly, dismal and ubiquitous," says Rick Bell, who heads the American Institute of Architects' New York chapter. "They define our pedestrian experience -- like the arcades of Bologna."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Italy and the arcades of Bologna didn't leap to mind on a warm day at the Queensbridge Houses. North America's biggest public-housing project, Queensbridge sits across the East River from Manhattan. It has 3,142 apartments in chains of six-story brick buildings. They date to 1939 and don't look a day younger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sidewalk sheds wreath Queensbridge. Pedro Mora was sitting on a bench in front of one that led to the doorway of his building. The brickwork above it looked like stale sponge cake. How long had the shed been there? As Mr. Mora paused to calculate, another man passed by and screamed, "10 years!" Mr. Mora said, "It's been there long enough that it should have been gone a long time ago."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shed's plywood was warped and peeling. Rust coated its columns and duct tape, wrapped around its bolts so they wouldn't rip people's pockets, crumbled to the touch. The permit number had faded from the mandatory sign, but the owner's name was legible: NYCHA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City Housing Authority spokesman Howard Marder explained: "That shed was put there several years ago. The actual work that was supposed to be performed actually wasn't."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When would the work begin? "Everything is moving ahead," said Mr. Marder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until the 1980s, the sight of a sidewalk shed in New York actually signified actual work. "If you saw that a wall was leaning, you did something," says Ken Buettner, president of York Scaffold, one of the city's big, unionized shed builders. Yet many owners, he says, "maintained a continuing nonmaintenance regimen."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That ended in 1979, when some masonry fell from an apartment house and killed a Columbia University freshman. The city reacted to the news with a 1980 law that makes owners check every facade taller than five stories every five years. If anything is ready to drop, up goes a shed. Inspectors prowl with binoculars. If they spot a crack, up goes a shed. When something does fall off a building, which happens, up goes a shed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To avoid fines, owners often fix buildings. Five years later, they often fix them again. Or not. As Mr. Buettner explains:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In a market like you got right now, the guy who bought the building 10 years ago that's approaching underwater -- you think he's going to wrestle $150,000 out of the bank to do the masonry? The bank's not going to be so friendly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is how sheds become permanently temporary. New Yorkers live with them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zahara Valentino was selling newspapers under one recently near City Hall. "It's dry in the winter," she said. A few blocks away, past the Department of Buildings (which has had a shed around it for months), Anicet de Mbeng was managing a shed-enveloped shoe store. He said, "It's cool in the summer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sheds are useful if you lack an umbrella or need a chinning bar. As a joke, Paul Richard, an artist, turned a Brooklyn shed into art last year by sticking a label on it: "Paul Richard, Untitled; Wood, Metal and Mixed Media; estimate: $94,000." In May, other artists nailed cut-out birds to a shed below the Brooklyn Bridge. (It was owned by the state parks office, though, which tore the birds down.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sidewalk sheds obscure storefront signs, but advertisers adore them. For years, sheds functioned as unauthorized billboards. They stayed up forever, many assumed, only to sell cars and blue jeans. In 2006, after the Municipal Arts Society called them "a blight on our city's streetscape," most of the ads were removed. The sheds remained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the City Council has a bill before it to legalize ads as a revenue source. "Sheds look better dressed than undressed," says Rick Delmastro, who runs City Outdoor, Inc., a billboard company that was responsible for dressing hundreds of sheds. But others have higher ambitions: They want an all-new sidewalk shed -- airy and elegant. The talk among architects, in fact, is that the city is about to launch a competition to design one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The word "design" made Jimmy Downes roll his eyes. "It's going to cost,"" he said. "It's going to cost a lot."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Downes, 43 years old, started out as a farmer in the west of Ireland. Now he owns a shed company -- Everest -- in the South Bronx. He was in Brooklyn one morning, waiting for his crew to arrive for a job at a school belonging to a community of Hasidic Jews.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The school appears in a 1929 Brooklyn atlas as the "Menora Masonic Temple." It has changed hands since then. On this day, its 80-foot-high facade had a cornice with a tooth missing and a selection of other masonry ornaments conceivably ready to drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Downes had been hired to put a shed over the sidewalk to protect pedestrians. He faced one obstacle, though: There already was a shed over the sidewalk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sheds don't just proliferate in New York. They overlap. With unemployed contractors swarming in, a job can draw 20 bids. The school's cornice, city records show, fell 14 months ago. A 234-foot shed went up. No facade work was done. When the shed permit expired a year later, the school went shopping for a sweeter deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It got one from Mr. Downes. (He would only say his prices run $75 per foot and up, plus rent.) His rival was in no rush to cart away its pipes and planks. Half were still in place when the Everest crew pulled up. "We solve a different jigsaw puzzle every day," said Mr. Downes as his men began assembling pipes and planks of their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Observing this event from the curb, one of the school's bus drivers said: "Today we have a sidewalk shed. Now it's being taken down and a new sidewalk shed is going up. Today there is a shed. Later, there will also be a shed. But it will be a different shed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only question was: When?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home construction surged in June, adding to evidence the housing market is beginning to bounce back, but rising unemployment threatens to hinder a strong economic recovery, according to reports released Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of new homes rose in June by 3.6% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 582,000, the Commerce Department said Friday. It was the third consecutive monthly gain, leaving the level of new-home construction at its highest since November, although the pace remains well below the 1.1 million rate seen in June 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall gain was driven by a 14.4% jump in construction of single-family homes -- the biggest monthly gain in four years and the fourth consecutive improvement this year, bringing the pace of new single-family home construction to 470,000 units at an annual rate. The gain offset a decline in construction of multifamily homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report echoed news Thursday that home-builder confidence in the U.S. continues to recover, as an index of sentiment rose to 17 in July, its highest since September, from 15 in June. Later this month, reports on June home sales will show whether increased buying activity is behind the surge in home construction -- or whether the new units will add to already bloated inventories and weigh further on prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One key barrier to a recovery in the housing market -- and the economy overall -- is the rising unemployment rate, leaving fewer workers in a position to buy a house. The U.S. unemployment rate rose to a seasonally adjusted 9.5% in June as the total number of jobs lost in this recession, which began in December 2007, hit 6.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michigan has the highest U.S. unemployment rate, 15.2% as of June, according to a U.S. Labor Department report on state unemployment released Friday. It is the first time since 1984 that a state has recorded a jobless rate above 15%, the department noted. The next highest are Rhode Island at 12.4%, Oregon at 12.2%, South Carolina at 12.1% and Nevada at 12%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Hong Kong developer is getting ready for a U.S. road show to raise $1 billion to buy distressed apartment buildings in China, but the company's fund-raising team appears pessimistic about its chances here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm becoming a bit jaded on Americans, and a little bit hung up," says William Nobrega, a Conrad Group managing partner advising Hong-Kong based <span class="companylink">Canada Land Ltd</span>. on its fund-raising efforts for its CDL China Real Estate Opportunity Fund LP. Asian and European institutional investors are bullish on Chinese real estate, Mr. Nobrega says, but not so for their U.S. counterparts. "In many cases, what we have found is that many American investors have pulled out of the Asian market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CDL has already raised $220 million, Mr. Nobrega says, mostly from big investors in other countries. In the U.S., CDL will face a tough audience. Cash-strapped pension funds and college endowments are dialing down their exposure to real-estate risk in the midst of a disastrous year for commercial-property investments. Just three Americans attended a CDL-sponsored property conference in Singapore recently, Mr. Nobrega said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toxic Space</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new report by <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, a commercial brokerage firm, says there is about 85 million square feet of sublease space on the market nationwide, roughly equivalent to the size of the entire Phoenix market. Sublease inventory grew more than 10% in the second quarter from the first quarter, according to the report, the sharpest rise yet in this down cycle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As long as job losses continue, sublease space will continue to pile up," said John Sikaitis, vice president, director of research, for <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> and the report's author.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The excess space comes mainly from banks and other financial institutions in New York and the surrounding area. <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. recently listed 450,000 square feet at 277 Park Avenue, in Midtown Manhattan; it no longer needs the space because, when it acquired <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns Cos</span>. last year, it also acquired the firm's <span class="companylink">Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill</span>-designed 45-story headquarters at 383 Madison Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other sizable sublet blocks came from life-sciences companies in Boston, New Jersey and Northern California, as well as some media companies in Los Angeles. The swelling inventory helped drive effective rents down a steep 15.3% over the past 12 months, says Mr. Sikaitis, as building owners were forced to cut asking rents and offer steeper concessions. "Sublease is toxic to landlords," says Ted Leary, president of Crosswater Realty Advisors, a real-estate consulting firm specializing in restructuring.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Vornado Makes a Big Bet on Distressed Properties; REIT Is Seeking $1 Billion for a Private-Equity Fund That Will Focus on New York and Washington</span>
</div><div class="author">By Anton Troianovski   </div><div>1032 words</div><div>8 July 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span>, one of the biggest real-estate investment trusts in the U.S., is seeking to raise $1 billion for a private-equity fund to invest in the wave of distressed properties expected to hit in the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move signals that Vornado, which has one of the industry's most respected management teams, believes it can raise equity more cheaply from private investors than in the public market. But the company, long a darling of investors, risks dismaying shareholders who hoped Vornado would use its investing expertise to do deals on its own balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vornado says the proposed fund, Vornado Capital Partners LP, would be the company's "exclusive vehicle for real-estate and real-estate-related investments," according to a presentation to potential investors that was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. In the presentation, Vornado said the fund would aim to generate returns of over 20% by taking advantage of distress in the real-estate market. Vornado would focus on the areas it knows best -- office and retail properties in New York and Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company would provide 20% of the capital in the fund. That means Vornado would generate management fees and a big chunk of any profits. But if Vornado hits a home run, much of the profit would go to private investors like pension funds and endowments, as opposed to Vornado's common shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This has long been a company that has created an awful lot of value by taking advantage of opportunities on its own balance sheet," said Green Street Advisors analyst Mike Kirby. "If you're bringing in outside partners, granted you can make outsize fees, but the challenge will be convincing [shareholders] that those fees are as lucrative as the opportunities themselves."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Vornado Chairman Steven Roth and Chief Executive Michael Fascitelli, the fund is a chance to do more of the bottom-market deals that made the company successful after previous downturns. In the early 1990s, Mr. Roth made a bet on Alexander's, a bankrupt Manhattan retailer, that paid off years later when the <span class="companylink">Bloomberg LP</span> headquarters was built on Alexander's land. And in 1997, Vornado got a foothold in the Manhattan office market by buying stakes in seven office buildings for $700 million. Messrs. Roth and Fascitelli declined to comment on the proposed fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts believe other bargains will emerge as real-estate deals completed at the top of the market return to the market, at much cheaper prices. On Friday, a partnership led by developer George Comfort &amp; Sons agreed to buy Worldwide Plaza in Manhattan from <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> for about $600 million. According to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, the building was purchased in 2007 for $1.74 billion by developer Harry Macklowe. Unable to refinance short-term debt, Mr. Macklowe handed back control of Worldwide and six other Manhattan skyscrapers to lenders led by <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts believe Vornado is well positioned to ride out the commercial real-estate downturn. The company played defense by raising $710 million through a stock offering in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, REITs raised some $13 billion in the stock market this spring. Much went to pay down loans, but analysts and REIT executives have said they expect REITs to continue raising capital in the public market to buy properties from distressed landlords. "Most smart observers feel like the cheapest capital for the next few years is going to be in the public market, not the private market," Mr. Kirby said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vornado's move appears to counter that view. To go on the offense, the company will try to tap private investors, a tall order in today's market. "Vornado has some marquee strength because of the people," said Geoffrey Dohrmann, who heads Institutional Real Estate Inc., an industry consulting firm. But "a lot of folks are feeling that while there are going to be tremendous opportunities, they haven't unfolded in wholesale fashion yet, and there's no penalty for waiting."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some REITs, such as warehouse owners <span class="companylink">ProLogis</span> and <span class="companylink">AMB Property Corp</span>., have run private funds for years. They often have focused on properties that the REIT itself develops. Vornado's fund would have a broader mandate, and it is structured like a classic real-estate "opportunity fund" that seeks out good buys across regions and property types.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dohrmann said some institutional investors, notably sovereign-wealth funds and a few large endowments, still have money to invest. And he argued that an opportunity fund is the best structure to invest in distressed real estate, which may not generate cash flow for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Vornado faces a tough fund-raising environment. Many pension funds and endowments doubled down on highly leveraged real-estate "opportunity funds" during this decade's boom. Those are now posting dismal returns, leaving many institutional investors skittish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Restuccia, chairman of the San Joaquin County Employees' Retirement Association in California, said the pension fund isn't looking to commit new money to real estate. The fund had $136 million invested in real estate at the end of 2008, and Mr. Restuccia isn't happy with the results. "I'm very disappointed with all of these real-estate funds," he said. "I'm not so sure that I have enough confidence that somebody's going to be able to go out there and convince me that they're getting such a great buy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In deciding to focus on properties in Washington and New York, Vornado has picked two markets that tend to be resilient over the long term, but are performing very differently in the current recession. The Washington office market in the past year has held up better than in most U.S. metropolitan areas, according to research firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>. Average rents there rose 0.9% in the past 12 months. New York, meanwhile, saw a 14.9% decline in rents, worse than any other office market in the country.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">FUNDAMENTALS OF INVESTING; Seeking Shelter, Literally; Real-estate mutual funds and exchange-traded funds offer a chance to profit from any bottoming of prices for offices, apartments and shopping malls. But the investments carry lots of risk.</span>
</div><div class="author">By Jane Hodges   </div><div>1662 words</div><div>6 July 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists think the bottom is in sight for America’s hard-hit real-estate markets, and real-estate mutual funds have been among the investing world’s biggest gainers of the past few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So is it time to get into the game—or is it already too late?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Depending on their clients’ goals, advisers recommend allocating 5% to no more than 15% of an overall portfolio to real estate. Real-estate mutual funds and exchange-traded funds generally are treated as diversification tools, on the theory that the real estate they own—office buildings, apartment complexes, shopping malls, storage facilities—follows different cycles than the stock market does.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the category has underperformed the dismal returns of the broader market in recent years, complicating any investment decision today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The funds also face some challenges these days as their historically high current yields shrink. They’ve been hit by dividend cuts as some of the real-estate investment trusts they hold aim to conserve cash in the face of tightened credit markets. And further complicating any buying decision for small investors is that the funds’ dividend payments carry tax complications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what to do? In short, numerous financial advisers think it is safe to dip a toe—but not a whole foot—into the water. Here’s a quick review of the things you need to know about this category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q:First things first. What kinds of funds are in this category?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A:Real estate has grown as a fund-investing option this decade, meaning there are dozens of ways to get into the game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a recent figures from <span class="companylink">Morningstar Inc</span>., the biggest fund is Vanguard REIT Index, at $6.63 billion, followed by <span class="companylink">Fidelity Real Estate Investment</span> at $1.88 billion, <span class="companylink">T. Rowe Price Real Estate</span> at $1.65 billion, DFA Real Estate Securities at $1.55 billion and Russell Real Estate Securities at $1.4 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the largest mutual funds, “you’ll see holdings in a wide variety of commercial real estate—office space, storage facilities, shopping malls, medical and industrial buildings,” says Andrew Gogerty, a senior fund analyst at Morningstar. These funds own shares of big, publicly traded real-estate investment trusts like <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group Inc</span>., Public Storage, <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span>, <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span> and <span class="companylink">AvalonBay Communities Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some newly launched REITs aim to sift through the rubble of the U.S. residential mortgage market, but you won’t find much of that in the biggest funds. “By and large, these might be too small to merit attention from the larger mutual funds,” Mr. Gogerty says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the largest real-estate ETFs are iShares Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index, <span class="companylink">iShares Cohen &amp; Steers Realty Majors Index</span>, SPDR Dow Jones REIT, and Vanguard REIT ETF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While they generally aren’t recommended for small investors, any number of narrower funds—those focused, say, on storage only or apartments only—also are available, particularly in the ETF world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q:How hard, exactly, have the past few years been on real-estate funds and ETFs?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A:U.S. real-estate mutual funds and ETFs have taken a worse hit than the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span> 500-stock index over the past one, three and five years, according to Morningstar. U.S.. real-estate mutual funds clocked in with a negative return of 43.2% for the year through June 30, a negative 19.2%-a-year return over the past three years and a negative 3.7%-a-year return over the past five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Vanguard 500 Index posted a negative return of 26.2% for the 12 months through June 30, a negative return averaging 8.3% a year over the past three years, and a negative 2.3%-a-year return over the past five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q:A longstanding pitch for the real-estate category has been that these funds zig when stocks zag. The above results did zig, but in the wrong direction. Is this the death of the diversification argument?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A:Not exactly. The diversification argument still has merit in the eyes of most financial advisers we talked to. Indeed, even though the biggest real-estate funds last year fell just as hard as, and in some cases harder than, general stock funds, they are still seen as a way to hedge against the general market in the long term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, investors were worse off with real-estate funds over the past five years than if they had stuck with an S&amp;P 500 fund. But real-estate funds, on average, have a notably better 10-year return than the broader stock market. Vanguard’s REIT fund returned an average of 5.1% a year for the decade through June 30, for instance, while the Vanguard 500 fund lost an average of 2.3% a year over the period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Allocating money to real estate does still have a role,” says Morningstar’s Mr. Gogerty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Chamberlain, an adviser who runs Chamberlain Financial Planning in Sacramento, Calif., says that real estate has the stock market’s upside potential but can also be viewed as a bond holding, thanks to the steady stream of rents that REITs collect. He notes that many state pension funds include real estate as an asset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, even those financial advisers who recommend the category are quick to offer caveats. Kevin Brosious, president of Wealth Management Inc. in Allentown, Pa., notes that real-estate funds carry a higher “beta,” a measure of market risk or volatility, than the S&amp;P 500. The funds’ beta is usually about 1.5, he says, while the broader market has a beta of one. “Over the past year or so, this has absolutely been true of real-estate funds,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To mitigate this riskiness, he and other advisers say, small investors are wise to use real-estate funds only as a small piece of a well-diversified portfolio, and to stick with highly diversified funds or ETFs like the index-tracking, low-cost Vanguard products. Morningstar recommends some actively managed funds, noting that managers at these can tip their exposure toward industries and sectors that have the best prospects. Its current picks are <span class="companylink">T. Rowe Price Real Estate</span> and J.P. Morgan U.S. Real Estate funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q:Real-estate funds have certainly been battered over the past few years. Are they good bargains now—even after the recent run-up?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A:The answer is yes, to enthusiasts like Mr. Brosious. In the three months after the broader market’s low of March 9 this year, Morningstar’s U.S. real-estate fund category soared 58.8%, compared with the Vanguard 500 fund’s 40.2% total return. But real-estate funds were so depressed going into the rally that the category remains down 9% so far this year through June 30, compared with a 3.2% positive return for Vanguard’s S&amp;P 500 index fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Right now, REITs have been so impacted it’s a buying opportunity,” says Mr. Chamberlain. He is advising clients with lots of large-stock exposure to consider using REITs as well as small stocks and foreign shares to diversify.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those with a more bearish outlook note that even the more promising economic outlooks for real estate aren’t all that promising. Accounting firm <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span> and research group Urban Land Institute expect financial and real-estate markets to hit bottom this year and to “flounder” during 2010, according to their joint Emerging Trends in Real Estate 2009 report. <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> Economy.com anticipates a slightly slower recovery, expecting U.S. residential real estate to bottom out during the first quarter of 2010, followed by commercial real estate in mid-2010, according to <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> economist Andres Carbacho-Burgos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it is harder than ever to predict how real-estate funds will perform, says Mitchell Corwin, an ETF analyst at Morningstar. “Many of these REITs aren’t as reliable right now as they’ve been,” he says. In the past, they offered bond-like yields and stock-like returns, he says. But over the next few years there’s “little visibility” as to how they’ll function, because much of their success depends on the broader economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We think it’s likely that the return on REITs will be less than the returns on stock,” he says, noting that this applies to both near-term and long-term expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q:What are the dividend and tax ­issues?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A:Many REITs have begun cutting their dividends, Mr. Gogerty notes, because it is no longer easy to get cheap financing to expand a firm’s property empire, as it was earlier in this decade. Dividend cuts, for many, are the most viable way to make the necessary principal and interest payments on their existing debt, as refinancing and asset sales are proving difficult, he says. As dividends are cut, the usefulness of the yield statistic for predicting future fund dividend distributions will be diminished, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brosious, however, says that even trimmed dividends are still “tremendous,” and he believes that the mix of dividend cuts and recapitalization efforts “has put the confidence back into” real-estate funds. Recently, the Vanguard REIT fund had a dividend yield of 5.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax issue? Many dividends from REITs are “non-qualified,” which means that fund owners will see these dividends taxed as ordinary income, rather than at a maximum 15% dividend tax rate. Thus, some advisers recommend that investors stash their real-estate funds and ETFs inside a tax-deferred account.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Deborah Lynn Blumberg   </div><div>551 words</div><div>2 July 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shorter-term Treasurys jumped, but longer-term Treasurys deteriorated on remarks from San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Janet Yellen that interest rates could stay very low for some time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two- and three-year Treasury notes, the most sensitive to interest-rate expectations, were energized after Ms. Yellen said the federal-funds rate could stay near 0% for a while. Ms. Yellen said she believed the Fed's top concern should be to stimulate the economy, despite signs of improvement. The central banker is currently a voting member of the interest-rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasurys maturing in the next seven to 30 years, though, were weaker. Her comments about helping out the economy even more fueled fears about inflation. Long-term Treasurys also were under pressure as investors anticipated the next round of supply from the government. The Treasury will auction off three- and 10-year notes next week and will announce auction sizes Thursday. Rising risk appetite at the start of the new quarter also was feeding into longer-term Treasurys' downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks were higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing up 0.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As we begin a new quarter, investor appetite for Treasurys and other high-quality assets appears to be subsiding, as is often the case," said Kevin Giddis, head of fixed-income sales trading and research at <span class="companylink">Morgan Keegan &amp; Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market participants also were adjusting positions ahead of Thursday's June nonfarm payrolls report, and heading into the long holiday weekend. The government bond market will be shuttered Friday for the Fourth of July holiday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday afternoon, the benchmark 10-year note was down 7/32 point, or $2.1875 per $1,000 face value, at 96 16/32. Its yield rose to 3.548% from 3.521% Tuesday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond was down 18/32 point to yield 4.344%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As investors sold long-dated Treasurys to stock up on shorter-term ones, Treasurys' benchmark yield curve, the gap between the two- and 10-year yields, steepened notably, to plus 2.49 percentage points from plus 2.41 percentage points late Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland, pointed to thin trading ahead of the holiday, noting that next week should provide a clearer picture as to where the Treasury market is headed. Given supply though, he expects bond yields to head higher in the coming week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, economic data were mixed: The ISM manufacturing index rose to 44.8 in June from 42.8 in the prior month, but a reading below 50 still means manufacturing activity continues to contract. Construction spending fell again, marking the fifth drop in six months, and pending home sales rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market participants now are eagerly awaiting Thursday's payrolls report. The prior report took investors by surprise: Jobs dropped by just 345,000 compared with the 525,000 expected. Wednesday's ADP employment report, a precursor to payrolls, showed U.S. private-sector jobs in June dropped by 473,000, more than the 400,000 loss forecast by economists.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Declines in U.S. manufacturing activity slowed last month, raising the likelihood that the sector -- and perhaps the U.S. economy -- could see some growth in the second half of this year. But separate reports showed the labor market remains weak, a key obstacle to recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising production and a shallower drop in employment helped push the Institute for Supply Management's index of manufacturing activity to 44.8 in June from 42.8 in May. It was the sixth straight monthly increase, though activity still remains below the 50 level that signals overall growth in the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sector is a small part of overall employment and gross domestic product, but it serves as a barometer of the nation's business climate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, a June employment report from payroll company <span class="companylink">Automatic Data Processing Inc</span>. showed that the U.S. shed 473,000 private-sector jobs last month -- the smallest decline since October, but a higher number than expected and a sign that the government's official estimate, which is released Thursday, could dash hopes for notable improvement in labor-market conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the housing market continues to show signs of recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales, an index of contracts signed that is typically released about a month before reported sales, rose slightly in May, the National Association of Realtors said. The index gained 0.1 point to a seasonally adjusted 90.7, its highest level since September. Pending sales rose in the Northeast and West, and dipped in the Midwest and South. An index level of 100 represents contract activity in 2001, the first year the data were collected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Wednesday, the Commerce Department said U.S. spending on construction declined in May, falling 0.9% to $964 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. The drop was led by a 3.5% decline in residential construction spending to $247.4 billion. While residential spending levels are down a third from a year ago, the declines are shallower than in the first quarter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a people we need, at all times, the encouragement of home ownership. --HERBERT HOOVER, 1932</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea that home ownership confers special benefits on American society is deeply embedded in our culture—so much so that our national tax policy confers a special benefit of its own on it. Home ownership is granted an advantage over all other forms of ownership in the form of an enormous deduction on the interest payments most individuals incur in financing their homes. Nothing else in the tax code comes anywhere near that deduction in scope or size. We have decided, as a nation, that home ownership is not only a good thing for an individual or a family, but that it is beneficial for the public at large and the country as a whole. Otherwise, why would it be necessary for the government to give it this kind of preferential treatment? Without it, clearly, we believe that the national rate of home ownership would be lower, and that a lower rate of home ownership would be deleterious to our common weal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After 2000, the national push toward home ownership intensified in three dimensions, leading to a doubling of housing prices in just five years' time. First, the Federal Reserve Board's interest-rate policy drove down the cost of borrowing money to unprecedented lows. Second, a common conviction arose that home ownership should be available even to those who, under prevailing conditions, could not afford it. Finally, private agencies charged with determining the risk and value of securities were exceptionally generous in their assessment of the financial products known as "derivatives" whose collateral resided in the value of thousands of mortgages bundled together. The rating agencies understated the risks from these bundled mortgages by assuming that home prices were simply going to rise forever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the housing bubble burst in 2006, the damage to the financial system pushed the global economy into the worst contraction since the Great Depression. In the midst of the pain and suffering that have accompanied financial collapse and economic contraction—over $15 trillion in wealth has been lost by American households alone while, to date, more than 6 million job losses have boosted the unemployment rate to 9.4 percent—much of the blame has been placed on unregulated financial markets whose behavior is said to have revealed a terrible flaw in the foundation of capitalism itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was a market failure, we are told, and the promise of capitalism has always been that the self-correcting mechanisms built into the system would preclude the possibility of a systemic market failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the housing bubble only burst after government subsidies pushed house prices up so fast that marginal buyers could no longer afford to chase prices even higher. A bubble created by rigged financial markets and a government-sponsored obsession with home ownership is not a result of market failure, but rather, a result of bad public policy. The belief that home ownership, per se, is such a benefit that no amount of government support could be too great and no pace at which home prices rise could be too fast is the root of the crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was no market failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, an invaluable collection of precise summaries of virtually every topic in the dismal science: "The best way to understand market failure is first to understand market success, the ability of a collection of idealized competitive markets to achieve an equilibrium allocation of resources which is Pareto optimal." Allow me to translate. "Pareto optimality," a term named after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto (1848– 1923), is defined as an allocation of economic resources that produces the greatest good. Thus, if one changes the allocation of resources away from "Pareto optimality" for the purpose of making someone better off, that change will make someone else worse off. Economists have expended a great deal of effort to demonstrate that free and competitive markets produce an outcome that is "Pareto optimal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not to say that there is no such thing as market failure. There are many instances of market failure. Someone may possess information that others do not, as in insider trading, and thereby gain an illegitimate leg up. There may be too few players in a given market, which allows them to manipulate, hoard, and toy with prices. Capricious government intervention in cases where it is neither required nor appropriate constitutes another condition that may create a market failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also cases of market failure in which some people get a free ride while others bear a disproportionate burden. This is the case in national defense, for example, in which soldiers bear a burden non-soldiers do not. Consequently, a government subsidy for national defense is necessary for the maintenance of security and power, and the overwhelming majority of citizens acknowledges it and does not complain about it. National defense is a public good, perhaps the original public good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owner-occupied housing is something else that has been deemed a public good. Herbert Hoover's affirmation of the need for encouragement of home ownership "at all times" came in 1932 at the fiercest stage of the Great Depression. Others have made powerful arguments that homeowners make better citizens and contribute to stable communities. Why renters do not and cannot offer the same contribution to the public good is never specified, but existing homeowners, homebuilders, mortgage lenders, and mortgage servicers have all seized on the idea that subsidizing home ownership is "Pareto optimal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subsidies for home ownership—in the form of full deductibility of mortgage interest, lower mortgage borrowing rates derived from government guarantees for mortgage lenders like <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, and deductibility of local real-estate taxes—have long benefited those who own homes at the expense of those who do not. The size and severity of the burst bubble makes a mockery of the argument that the disproportionate gains to homeowners also improved the welfare of renters. By erasing, in just a few years, nearly one-third of the wealth on the national balance sheet, the collapse has created a substantial loss in national welfare, including for renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home ownership should not be considered a public good deserving of government subsidies even without the bubble collapse for a simple reason: Those who receive the subsidy get to capture the benefits in the form of home prices that are higher than they would otherwise be without government support. The subsidies make homeowners better off while they make renters worse off. They are, therefore, not Parieto optimal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, home-ownership subsidies are inherently unjust. They favor the relatively well-off at the expense of those who are poorer. Why? Because the value of an owned home and the size of the government subsidy both grow as income increases. A tax deduction tied to home ownership for a well-to-do American with a $1 million mortgage and a $60,000 annual interest payment is worth $22,000 (assuming the American is in the 35 percent tax bracket). The higher the marginal tax rate rises, the more valuable the mortgage-interest deduction is to the homeowner. For a family with a modest income that may pay little or no income tax, the mortgage-interest deduction is worth virtually nothing. And yet, for the past 15 years, even the party in the United States most associated with preferential treatment for the poor began preaching the evangel of home ownership as a form of class salvation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During Bill Clinton's first term, government housing policy changed substantially. After decades in which liberal politicians and thinkers devoted themselves to arguments for expanding the number of public-housing units, the disastrous condition of those units led the President, a "new Democrat," to a dramatic ideological shift in emphasis. No longer would public housing be at the top of the liberal Democratic agenda. Instead, borrowing from conservative ideas about the inestimable benefit of home ownership to the striving poor, the Clinton administration and members of his party in the House and Senate decided to use government power to achieve that aim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1994, the "National Homeownership Strategy" of the Clinton administration advanced "financing strategies fueled by creativity to help homeowners who lacked the cash to buy a home or the income to make the down payments" to buy a home nonetheless. It became U.S. government policy to intervene in the marketplace by lowering the standards necessary to qualify for mortgages so that Americans with lower incomes could participate in the leveraged purchases of homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal of expanding home ownership led to the creation of new mortgage subsidies across the board. The loosening of standards became the policy of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the pseudo-private "government-sponsored enterprises" that bought mortgages from originating lenders. A particular change in the tax law in 1997 encouraged many households to make buying and improving a home the primary vehicle by which they enhanced net worth. By eliminating any capital-gains tax on the first $500,000 of profits from the sale of an owner-occupied residence once every two years, Washington encouraged enterprising American families to purchase homes, fix them up, re-sell them, and then repeat the process. Flipping became a financial pastime for millions because this special advantage created a new incentive—which didn't exactly fit the model of encouraging people to remain in a stable home for many years and thereby help to stabilize the neighborhood around them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was, however, a rival to home ownership as a way of building wealth in the late 1990s—the run-up in the stock market, which was caused by another bubble, this one in the technology sector. Given the size of the gains in the stock market, which were running 20 percent or more a year, the relative desirability of home ownership eroded. But when, in 2000, the tech bubble burst, households were left in search of an alternative way to store and enhance wealth. Home ownership emerged as the most promising alternative. After 2000, and especially after 2002, U.S. real house prices began to surge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everything I have described thus far constituted a necessary but not sufficient precondition for a full-fledged housing bubble. It took the addition of a new market in derivatives to drive bankers, lenders, and credit agencies to create the conditions for an implosion by expanding mortgage financing to borrowers who could not possibly afford the homes they were purchasing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February 2003, Angelo Mozilo, then head of the major mortgage supplier called Countrywide, declared that the need to provide a down payment should no longer be an impediment to home ownership for any American.\*08d0c9ea79f9bace118c8200aa004ba90b0200000009000000e0c9ea79f9bace118c8200aa004ba90b740000002e002e002f002e002e002f0044006f00630075006d0065006e0074007300200061006e0064002000530065007400740069006e00670073002f004b0067006a00650072006d0061006e0069002f004400650073006b0074006f0070002f004d0061006b0069006e002e00680074006d006c0000000600000066006f006f00740031000000 Was it any wonder that a home-buying frenzy occurred when Countrywide's chieftan was suggesting that there was no need for a purchaser to supply even a minimal equity stake in his purchase? During 2004 and 2005, the rise in home prices accelerated. That, in turn, caused Americans to refinance their homes to remove their equity—their accumulated wealth, in other words—and convert it into disposable income. They did so because they were confident the equity would simply be recreated by continued growth in the value of their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hunger for more mortgages that could serve as backing for more new securities led to the acceleration of undocumented, no-down-payment, negative-amortization mortgage loans to individuals with virtually no prospect of servicing them. The designers of derivative securities effectively collaborated with the rating agencies, such as <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> and <span class="companylink">Moody's</span>, that were relied upon (often through government mandate) by pension funds and other gigantic repositories of wealth with identifying the securities safe enough to invest in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A situation in which creators of derivatives provide the monetary compensation for the very agencies that are tasked with determining the riskiness of their securities hardly constitutes a competitive market. Indeed, it constitutes dangerous collusive behavior. But that collusion, again, was made possible by the distorting actions of government agencies, which effectively provided a subsidy for risk-taking that was, by definition, unsustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is fair to ask, in the light of past bubbles that have burst—like the entire economy of Japan in the 1990s and the tech-stock tragicomedy—why investors were prepared to take on the substantial risks tied to unfamiliar derivative securities whose value was tied to the continued rise in house prices. A substantial part of the answer lies with the Federal Reserve Board. It deliberately adopted a policy that it would not seek to identify bubbles and then to act in ways that would let the air out slowly. Instead, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan allowed bubbles to inflate and then stepped in to repair any damage afterward. This constituted a substantial subsidy to excessive risk-taking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The policy became clear in 1998, the year in which the unwinding of the Asian currency crisis together with Russia's defaulting on its debt created huge volatility in the credit markets. At the time, <span class="companylink">Long Term Capital Management</span>, a hedge fund, was on the verge of collapse, and an aggressive intervention was staged to save it. The New York Fed provided its offices and encouragement to bring financial firms together to contain it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The salvation of <span class="companylink">Long Term Capital Management</span> suggested a new reality for the marketplace: Aggressive risk-taking in pursuit of huge profits was manageable even if bubbles were created, just so long as the Fed was around to raise the "systemic risk flag" in the event of serious trouble. There would always be a rescue; the trick was to get out before everything began to collapse. It was this fact that led Charles Prince, then the head of Citicorp, to give the game away in July 2007 about the reckless and imprudent nature of his bank's conduct. "When the music is playing," Prince said, "you've got to get up and dance."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing bubble was thus a fully rational response to a set of distortions in the free market—distortions created primarily by the public sector. The heads of large financial institutions, as Prince's remark suggested, recognized the risk-taking subsidy inherent in public policy, but felt they had no choice but to play along or fall behind the other institutions that were also responding rationally to the incentives created by government intervention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing collapse and its painful aftermath, including that $15 trillion wealth loss for U.S. households (so far), do not, therefore, represent a market failure. Rather, they represent the dangerous confluence of three policy errors: government policy aimed at providing access to home ownership for American households irrespective of their ability to afford it; the Fed's claim that it could not identify bubbles as they were inflating but could fix the problem afterward; and a policy of granting monopoly power to rating agencies like <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span>, and Fitch's to determine the eligibility of derivative securities for what are supposed to be low-risk portfolios, such as pension funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's bubble policy has evolved in a constructive direction since the bursting of the U.S. housing bubble. The trauma of dealing with the aftermath, including the fire sale of the investment bank <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> and the outright failure of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>, has convinced the Fed that more effort should be directed toward identifying bubbles before they grow too large.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the collusive relationship between rating agencies and creators of derivative securities needs to be ended by bringing more market discipline to the process. Free entry into the rating business should be permitted. The monopoly of a small number of rating agencies to determine the eligibility of new securities for investment by massive pension funds is unjustifiable. The practice whereby the creators of such derivative securities compensate the rating agencies for the ratings also needs to be ended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alas, the federal government's response to the collapse of the housing bubble has been deeply problematic. It has chosen to provide additional subsidies to homeowners while nationalizing the government-sponsored enterprises, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, that helped to subsidize lower mortgage-interest rates While the extreme distress visited on American households by the collapse of the housing bubble certainly needs some alleviation, over the longer run we must have a serious national debate on the question of the degree to which we still want to consider home ownership a public good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The long-term solution is for government to stop playing favorites, as it has for decades with housing. Home ownership should neither be penalized nor favored under government policy. We have seen how that distortion led inexorably to a degree of wealth destruction we have not seen in our lifetimes. The distortion of the market introduced by government intervention can and must be brought to an end. The market that would take its place after this dramatic and admittedly difficult change would allow Americans to allocate their resources more effectively. It would no longer create an unjust advantage for the wealthy homebuyer. And it would, finally, make it possible for Americans to see their homes as they should be seen—not as investment vehicles, but rather, as the places they live in, the hearthstones of their families.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp;Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A California Association of Realtors report said sales of homes in the state rose 35.2% in May from a year earlier to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 556,590. A June 26 U.S. News article incorrectly said 556,590 California houses were sold in the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ July 3, 2009)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- California's median price for an existing single-family house rose for the third straight month, a sign that the state's battered real-estate market may be bottoming out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price increased to $267,570 in May for a California home, an increase of 4.2% from April, according to a report released Thursday by the California Association of Realtors. The inventory of unsold houses continued to drop, to 4.2 months' supply in May compared with 4.6 months in April and 8.7 months in May 2008. Prices were still well below their year-ago levels, down 30.4% compared with May 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One explanation for the increase in housing prices is that fewer foreclosed properties are among those being sold, said Kirk Lesh, an economist for California Lutheran University's Center for Economic Research and Forecasting. Banks tend to sell foreclosed houses at lower prices than do people selling their own homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California's real-estate market, the nation's largest, is seen as a barometer of the U.S. economy. Housing prices soared during the boom, and their plummet during the market's collapse resulted in massive foreclosures and fueled the recession. Economists say the state's housing market will lag behind the nation's in recovering, so any indication of improvement in California bodes well for the rest of the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Thursday's report, real-estate experts said they were a bit more optimistic that the California market is healing. But they warned that the state's 11.5% unemployment rate could result in more foreclosures and drive down real-estate prices again, as could lawmakers' plan to slash more than $10 billion from state spending to close a $24 billion deficit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The budget proposals include laying off thousands of state workers and cutting health and welfare programs for millions of Californians, as well as raising taxes. If enacted, they would further batter the state economy and, consequently, the housing market, said Mr. Lesh, the economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' report also said that 556,590 California houses were sold in May, up 35.2% from a year earlier. Sales may increase in coming months because prospective buyers believe the market is at a bottom, said Robert Bridges, a professor at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business. "The 'buy' decision would be a wise one right now because those pricing levels are getting attractive," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising orders for machinery and related goods, along with a firming of new-home prices in May, provided the latest evidence the U.S. economy's free fall has ended, though conditions remain weak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders for durable goods, such as transportation equipment, machinery and metals, rose 1.8% in May from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted $163.9 billion, the Commerce Department said Monday. That suggests companies in the U.S. and abroad are becoming more optimistic about business and sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders climbed for the third time in four months, though they're still down about 27% from a year ago. The gain was driven by higher orders for aircraft, machinery and computers, which helped offset a slump in demand for autos as that industry reels from the bankruptcies of <span class="companylink">Chrysler LLC</span> and <span class="companylink">General Motors Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a key gauge of business investment -- orders for capital goods excluding defense and aircraft -- surged 4.8% in May, its biggest monthly gain in nearly five years. The increase is "the most encouraging sign to date the severe downturn in corporate investment spending is quickly moderating," said <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co</span>. economist Michael Feroli.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, Commerce reported sales of new homes dipped a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in May after a strong April gain, and are off nearly a third from a year earlier. Prices, however, proved surprisingly firm, as the median sales price rose to $221,600, the highest since November. The backlog of unsold homes also shrank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other sectors of the U.S. economy have also shown some improvement recently: Consumer confidence is back to pre-September levels, while new claims for unemployment benefits have declined from April highs. Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis forecasting firm, estimates U.S. gross domestic product will contract at a 1.3% annual rate in the second quarter -- an improvement from the prior back-to-back declines of about 6% that marked the U.S. economy's worst performance in a half-century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But few economists expect the U.S. will now turn toward a strong recovery, particularly with the jobless rate at 9.4% and expected to march higher. Even the recent gains in manufacturing activity, some say, reflect stronger demand for capital goods from countries like China and Brazil, rather than improvement in U.S. conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group</span> economists are among the most vocal in warning the U.S. still has a considerable "output gap" and is performing well below capacity. That would mean that even if the recession were to end this year, it would still take a considerable amount of time -- and above-average growth -- just to get the economy operating back at full capacity.</p>

</div><div class="author">By David Wessel   </div><div>750 words</div><div>25 June 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy won't regain its strength until the price of houses stops falling. And that day hasn't yet arrived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The crisis cannot end fully until home prices in the U.S. are at least stabilizing," says Alan Greenspan, who continues to dissect housing data with as much interest as he did when he was Federal Reserve chairman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the two-thirds of American families who own their homes, a house is their biggest asset. The lower house prices go, the less wealthy they are and the less they can or will spend and borrow. For home builders, the lower home prices go, the fewer new homes they will build and the fewer workers they will hire. And for many American banks and other financial institutions, mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and financial instruments that rest on mortgages remain a huge headache. The lower house prices go, the less these loans and investments are worth and the weaker the foundations of the financial system are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although sales of houses seem to be perking up, a good sign, home prices aren't. The National Association of Realtors said this week that the median sale price of an existing single-family home in May -- $172,900 -- was 16.1% lower than a year ago. Prices of newly built homes in May were off 3.4% from a year earlier, the government estimated Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More sophisticated, though not as timely, measures that compare prices of the same houses when they are resold show similar trends. The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller indexes for 10 and 20 big metro markets are still falling. The latest readings show a nearly 19% decline between March 2008 and March 2009. The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>, which tracks only home sales with mortgages sold or backed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, said prices in April were down 6.8% year over year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consequences of a further steep decline in house prices on the overall economy are severe because it would cut so significantly into the American middle class, the vast army of consumers, the ones with conventional Fannie- and Freddie-backed mortgages, dubbed "conforming" in the trade. Any equity that subprime-mortgage borrowers had in their homes is gone. But about eight million conventional mortgages were made for home buyers in 2005 and 2006. House prices have fallen significantly since then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The bulk of conforming mortgages made since 2005 are close to being underwater," says Mr. Greenspan, meaning their mortgages are greater than the market price of their homes. Wow. Although many underwater homeowners will keep making monthly mortgage payments, they can't refinance or take out home-equity loans -- and are at greater risk of default and foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can take another 5% decline in house prices without much macroeconomic impact," Mr. Greenspan says. But if prices fall by 12%, more than four million additional homeowners will be underwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last August, Mr. Greenspan was predicting that home prices would "likely start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009." He now says that day will arrive about three to six months later than he anticipated. Fewer new households were formed than he anticipated, which meant less demand for housing. And new homes were completed faster than he anticipated, increasing the supply. As a result, the supply of vacant single-family homes for sale didn't fall as rapidly as he expected. Until this measure -- which he regards as the best summary of the glut of unsold houses on the market -- comes down significantly, home prices will keep falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Meyer, the seasoned economic forecaster and former Fed governor, says one of the most important differences between "people who are bearish on the economic outlook and those who are less bearish" is their prediction about home prices. Mr. Meyer is in the less-bearish camp. He sees a slowdown in the pace of home-price declines and expects the U.S. economy to be growing at better than a 2% pace by the fourth quarter, faster than many other forecasters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three things could prove Mr. Meyer and the like-minded wrong about their encouraging outlook: a sustained increase in the thriftiness of U.S. consumers, which would depress overall growth; a relapse of financial turbulence, which would do the same; and persistently steep declines in the price of houses.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- New-home sales in the U.S. unexpectedly fell in May as Americans afraid of losing their jobs stayed out of the market or settled for a cheaper house discounted by foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes fell 0.6% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 342,000, the U.S. Commerce Department said Wednesday. April sales rose 2.7% to an annual rate to 344,000, Wednesday's data showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year-over-year, new-home sales were nearly 33% lower than the level in May 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New homes are in competition with previously owned homes, which are cheaper these days because of foreclosures. The fourth decrease in six months for new-home sales was a disappointment following a report last week that home construction climbed in May far above expectations, up 17%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for a new home fell in May to $221,600, down 3.4% from $229,300 in May 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excess supply has brought prices down. At the end of May, there were an estimated 292,000 homes for sale. That is down from the 299,000 for sale at the end of April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A housing sector recovery will likely be slow and painful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling prices and low mortgage rates have increased affordability. But the average 30-year mortgage rate has climbed in the last few months. An $8,000 government tax credit for first-time home buyers is enticing. But mortgage-lending standards are tighter than during the boom. The rate of layoffs is abating. But there are still too many people getting thrown out of work: Nonfarm payrolls fell by 345,000 jobs in May -- about half the average monthly decline for the prior six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, U.S. demand for expensive goods made a strong, surprising increase in May, the third climb in four months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers' orders for durable goods increased by 1.8% last month to a seasonally adjusted $163.92 billion, Commerce said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose by 4.8%, after decreasing 2.9% in April. It was the largest increase since 8.2% in September 2004. The orders are closely tracked as a gauge of capital spending by businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the big May increase, the recession has left capital orders down sharply year over year. Companies have had difficulty getting financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While manufacturing is suffering, it, like the entire economy, isn't as bad as it had been. Because companies are purging inventory and not demanding so much and because consumers saddled with debt and afraid of being laid off aren't spending so much, factories have lost a lot of steam. Industrial production fell 1.1% in May. But output was falling at about twice that rate at the end of 2008, when the recession apparently was at its deepest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers are still cutting inventory, Wednesday's data showed. Manufacturers' inventories of durable goods decreased in May 0.8%. Unfilled manufacturers' orders, a sign of future demand, decreased 0.3%. That's the eighth drop in a row.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. existing-home sales rose in May, climbing to their highest level in seven months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said Tuesday that sales of previously owned homes increased 2.4% last month, compared with April, to a seasonally adjusted 4.77 million annual rate. It was the second-straight month that sales improved, offering more evidence that the housing market has stabilized. Still, sales are at just two-thirds of the peak levels they reached in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current pace, it would take nearly 10 months to clear the 3.8 million homes on the market, the Realtors said. What's more, sales of distressed properties, such as homes in foreclosure, continue to contribute to the glut. Distressed sales accounted for a third of sales in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Although demand has stabilized, there is still a big imbalance in the market that needs to be corrected," said Zach Pandl, an economist with Nomura Securities in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for a home was $173,000 in May, up 3.8% from April, but down 16.8% from a year earlier. The Realtors' home-price measure can be distorted by the mix of homes sold in a month. If fewer high-end homes are sold, for example, that will drive the price measure down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Housing Finance Agency said Tuesday that its index of home prices was off 0.1% in April from March, and 6.8% below its year-earlier level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the government price index is based on repeat sales of the same houses, it avoids the distortions of the Realtors' measure. But it doesn't include homes with subprime and other nonconforming mortgages, which have been the source of much of the housing market's troubles.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. existing-home sales rose for a second month in a row during May, but prices again fell sharply, threatening to delay a housing-sector recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales increased 2.4% to a 4.77 million annual rate from 4.66 million in April, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday. The NAR originally reported that April sales were 4.68 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street had expected a 4.80 million sales rate for previously owned homes in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed-property sales have pushed year-over-year prices lower. The median price for an existing home last month was $173,000, down 16.8% from $207,900 in May 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to have increased sales to stabilize prices," NAR economist Lawrence Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previously owned home sales were down 3.6% from May 2008, Tuesday's report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak demand has kept inventories of unsold homes high. Inventories of previously owned homes fell 3.5% at the end of May to 3.8 million available for sale. That represented a 9.6-month supply at the current sales pace, compared with 10.1 in April. Excess supply is depressing prices.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing Statistics Need Closer Inspection</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those seeking a home-price bottom should beware that price gauges can send false signals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors releases May home-resale data. Economists expect an annualized sales pace of 4.8 million units, down 33% from May 2005, near the bubble's peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday brings Commerce Department data on May new-home sales, and economists see an annualized pace of 360,000 units, down 72% from May 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both reports will include pricing information, helpful for seeing how much pain homeowners have suffered and how much more banks will lose on their mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Happy pricing news has been scarce. Median new-home prices fell 14.9% in April from a year ago, nearly matching the worst decline of the housing bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things have been slightly more promising for existing homes, where median single-family home prices also fell 14.9% in April, an improvement over January's record 16.7% decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alas, that small uptick was merely "noise," says NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun, who wants to see three more such months before declaring price stabilization. Even then, Mr. Yun warns, investors shouldn't assume that home prices are rising broadly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble, notes Ivy Zelman, chief executive of housing research firm Zelman &amp;Associates, is the NAR's sample will increasingly include more-upscale homes as a glut of distressed, low-priced houses leaves the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lately, as much as 50% of home resales have been foreclosures, and most have been lower-priced homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the foreclosure vortex is gripping higher-priced homes. A house that sold for $600,000 during the boom and $400,000 in foreclosure will be recorded by the NAR as a $400,000 sale, lifting the national median but suggesting no real improvement in housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It will be very difficult for investors watching the median existing-home price to realize it could be masking deflation at higher parts of the housing food chain," says Ms. Zelman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller price indexes, updates of which are due next week, have their own issues, but track repeat sales of the same house and might better reflect the true losses of banks, mortgage companies and homeowners.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Indio, a small city east of Los Angeles, the supply of foreclosed houses for sale is plentiful. Even so, work crews are finishing a batch of new homes for <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the recession wiped out many small builders, mortgage lenders and homeowners, the nation's biggest builders have hung on, in part through favorable land deals, loan agreements and tax strategies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the worst appears to be over for most of them. Nationwide, new-home sales are showing signs of bottoming out. The stocks of the big home builders have rebounded from their November lows, and some have bolstered their cash and borrowing ability. Lennar and <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. each sold $400 million of bonds in April, and <span class="companylink">Ryland Group Inc</span>. sold $230 million worth, a sign that some investors think these companies will make it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A look at how Lennar navigated the worst housing crisis in decades reveals that timely land deals have been critical to its survival.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Land can humble you," says Emile Haddad, Lennar's chief investment officer. "On the surface it looks like the simplest real-estate asset, but it's really the most complicated."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar, based in Miami, was one of the largest home builders in states hit hardest by the housing collapse -- California and Florida. As the housing market was heading toward a cliff, it pulled off two complicated deals that got lots of risky land off its books before the market fell apart. The buyers: <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley Real Estate</span> Fund and the <span class="companylink">California Public Employees Retirement System</span>, the giant pension fund known as Calpers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar also entered into joint ventures to buy land, reducing its risk by not guaranteeing most of the $5 billion borrowed by the ventures. Some analysts say these agreements could come back to haunt Lennar, financially and legally, as lenders and partners seek to recover losses from soured projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The more joint ventures you have, the more partners you have that are likely to be struggling and angry,'' says Paul Puryear, a housing analyst at <span class="companylink">Raymond James &amp; Associates</span>. "It opens the door to a lot of disagreements."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Lennar's shares are up 128% since November, although they remain about 88% below their January 2006 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other publicly traded home builders also dumped land during the crunch. By selling land at huge discounts to what it was once valued, big builders generated large losses for tax purposes. By applying those losses against profits during prior years, they have collected about $2.55 billion in tax refunds this year, according to Zelman &amp; Associates, a housing-research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With foreclosure activity continuing to hold down prices of new homes, Lennar doesn't expect the boom times to return anytime soon. But with land values now far below their peaks, Lennar and other big builders think the time is getting ripe to start investing in it again. Lennar hopes to eke out profits by building on low-cost land and by selling low-priced homes to first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back to the Land</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the housing market cratered, Lennar put together a team to buy distressed housing assets. Lennar is now about to reinvest in some of the same California land it unloaded in its deal with Calpers in 2007. Next month, a federal judge is expected to decide whether to approve the bankruptcy reorganization plan for LandSource, the company that owns the land. Under the plan, Lennar will invest new capital to retain a stake. Calpers has walked away from the venture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting inexpensive land will be critical to builders' future profitability because new-home prices aren't expected to rise substantially for many months. Lennar isn't the only big builder angling to take advantage of soft land prices. Ryland, a California builder, has teamed up with investment firm Oak Tree Capital Management to buy low-cost land. <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> has been speaking to lenders interested in unloading foreclosed real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big builders are benefiting in other ways from the high mortality of small and midsize builders. The smaller players had loans cut off by lenders and are dying off in droves, surrendering market share to the big players. As many as half of the nation's privately held builders have shut down during the housing bust, and many others are struggling to survive, according to a <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Little Red Hen'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the big builders are shadows of their boom-time selves. New homes sold at an annual rate of 352,000 in April, down from a peak of 1.89 million in July 2005. Lennar sold 15,735 houses in 2008, down from 47,032 in 2006. It reported revenue of $4.6 billion last year, compared with $16.3 billion two years ago, and it now employs about 4,000, down from 14,000 at the peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar has been around for 55 years. Under Chief Executive Stuart Miller, the company expects every employee, including top executives, to wear a company badge with their first name. Each staffer was encouraged to periodically recite in front of their colleagues a poem, "Scratchings From the Little Red Hen," about a bird that refuses to give up looking for worms while a white rooster sits idly and complains about how difficult it is to find food. The tail of the company jet had an image of a red hen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the housing bust hit and layoffs began, the weekly poetry recitals stopped and the hen disappeared from the plane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar's land strategy was honed during previous downturns. Over the years, builders have gone bust because they took on too much debt to buy land, then were left insolvent when land values plummeted. Lennar decided one way to avoid that fate was to spread the risk to others and limit the debt on its balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the mid-1990s, Lennar moved into California, gaining its first sizable foothold by purchasing land from oil giant <span class="companylink">Chevron</span> and a bankrupt Canadian developer. Mr. Haddad, a Lebanese immigrant who joined Lennar as part of the deal, became a key land strategist in the state. The housing market was about to take off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar used joint ventures to persuade California's farming families and other big property owners to develop land they'd owned for generations. By forming partnerships with Lennar, many families could keep an ownership stake and participate in the upside as their citrus groves and cattle ranches were turned into housing developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Lennar typically owned 50% or less of each venture, or didn't hold voting control, Lennar says accounting rules required that it keep the debts off its balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar's chief executive, Mr. Miller, and his family also were able to profit from the real-estate deals through a company called <span class="companylink">LNR Property Corp</span>. Started as a Lennar division that acquired and managed distressed commercial real estate, LNR was spun off in 1997 as a separate publicly traded company. Mr. Miller was its chairman and largest shareholder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Cerberus Capital Management</span> bought 80% of LNR in 2004, leaving the Miller family with a 20% stake. The deal was valued at about $3.8 billion, which included about $1.76 billion of debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LNR took big ownership stakes in many of Lennar's California ventures. During the boom, Lennar and LNR bought big swaths of land: a shuttered naval shipyard in San Francisco, a former naval base in Orange County, and the 15,000-acre Newhall Ranch, outside of Los Angeles, which also included a small water company, a key asset in Southern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Facing a Crunch</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2006, Lennar decided that the good times were nearing an end for the housing industry. That summer, Lennar began to cut home prices to boost sales and generate cash in preparation for a downturn. Lennar also looked for ways to jettison land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar was facing a potentially serious cash crunch, in part because it was on the hook to pay back as much as $1.7 billion in debt used to finance joint ventures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calpers, which manages pensions for California's state workers and public employees, was in the market for land. Lennar wanted to sell most of its stake in the Newhall Ranch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early 2007, Lennar and LNR agreed to sell 68% of the venture, called LandSource, to a Calpers investment vehicle for $970 million. At the same time, LandSource borrowed $1.5 billion, distributing cash to stakeholders. All told, Lennar and LNR each netted $707 million from the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sixteen months later, with the housing recession raging, LandSource sought bankruptcy protection, which wiped out Calpers's majority stake, along with the remaining stakes of Lennar and LNR. Calpers has said it never anticipated the housing downturn would be so severe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raising Cash</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late 2007, Lennar cut a second big deal that raised cash. It sold about 11,000 home sites for $525 million to a partnership it formed with <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley Real Estate</span> Fund. Because Lennar was valuing the land on its books at $1.3 billion, the deal generated a large loss that allowed Lennar to collect a $320 million tax refund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, the value of the land has declined by at least 35%, estimates Tom Reimers, president of Park Place Land Advisors, a land broker in Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Considering all that has happened in the market, I think <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> clearly wishes it hadn't done that deal," says Mr. Reimers. <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The money raised from the two deals, coupled with the tax refunds, added to Lennar's cash reserves as the housing crisis hit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, Lennar bailed out of some joint ventures during the downturn. In some cases, it assumed some of the assets and debt and dissolved the venture. In others, it has been paying down the ventures' debts. All told, it has reduced the number to 95, from 261 in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar now says only about $500 million of the $4 billion in debt on its off-balance-sheet ventures involves so-called recourse loans, meaning Lennar must pay back the loan if the venture defaults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rancor Among Partners</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the troubled ventures produced rancor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Lennar has proven to be a challenging corporate citizen," says Craig Ewing, director of planning services for Palm Springs, Calif. Lennar had stopped work on a 400-acre housing project it was developing there with a joint-venture partner, leaving streets unfinished and an 18-hole golf course not maintained, Mr. Ewing says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar says the project stalled after its partner filed for bankruptcy. Mr. Ewing says Lennar recently returned to finish some of the work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicolas Marsch III, a real-estate developer in Southern California, is Lennar's partner on a joint venture outside San Diego called "The Bridges," an upscale housing development ringing a golf course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Marsch has sued Lennar, claiming it mismanaged the property and for failing to pay him his share of profits. Lennar, which says Mr. Marsch has received at least $50 million, has countersued, and a trial is expected to begin later this week in San Diego Superior Court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When assets are under stress, it can create some tension with partners," says Mr. Haddad. "Overall, I feel very good about how our ventures have performed." Lennar says that less than 2% of the joint ventures are tied up in litigation with partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar continues to pursue new joint-venture deals, such as its return to the busted LandSource deal. In LandSource's bankruptcy reorganization, Lennar has proposed buying 15% of a new venture that will hold most of LandSource's assets, including the 15,000 acres near Los Angeles, for $85 million. The rest of the venture would be owned by a group of LandSource's largest creditors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal would value the land at about 18% of its value when Calpers made its 2007 deal with Lennar and LNR. The new venture would have $100 million in cash and no borrowed money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It will be one of the most financially sound real-estate companies in the country," Mr. Haddad maintains.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Irish property prices have plummeted since 2002. But a "cottage" in County Galway owned by Connecticut Senator Chris Dodd has tripled in value during the same period, according to a financial disclosure form filed by the Senator this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are two possible explanations for this remarkable turn of fortune. Maybe Mr. Dodd is luckier than a leprechaun. Or could it be that he paid well below the market price when he bought out a co-owner in 2002 and had undervalued the property accordingly? If it's the latter, then Mr. Dodd received a "gift," in IRS parlance, and should have declared it on his financial disclosure form that year. He did not. Oh, and by the way, the seller at that low, low price has been the business partner of a man for whom Mr. Dodd lobbied to receive a Presidential pardon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also been nearly a year since a former loan officer at <span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial</span> charged that the mortgage lender had classified Mr. Dodd as a "very important person" (a.k.a., a "friend of Angelo" Mozilo, Countrywide's then-CEO). As such, Robert Feinberg said, Mr. Dodd received -- and knew he'd received -- preferential rates and fees on two mortgages he and his wife refinanced in 2003. As a power on the Senate Banking Committee, he also knew this was a conflict of interest. This was the era when Countrywide originated and then sold to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> high volumes of subprime loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SEC charged Mr. Mozilo with fraud and insider trading earlier this month, and the Los Angeles Times reported in May that there is an FBI investigation which "includes a probe of [Countrywide's] role in an influence-peddling scandal involving" Mr. Dodd. The Senate Ethics Committee won't comment on its own investigation of almost a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dodd denies receiving any special treatment, and nearly a year ago he promised to release the Countrywide mortgage documents and clear up the matter. We are still waiting, though he did attempt to placate the Connecticut press with a peek-a-boo release of a few select documents and a review by his own lawyers in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the Irish cottage on 10 scenic acres is bringing more trouble. At the start of the Irish real estate boom in 1994, Mr. Dodd bought the property with William Kessinger for $160,000. Mr. Kessinger has been a business partner of Edward Downe, who is a longtime friend of Mr. Dodd's. In 1986 Messrs. Dodd and Downe owned a condominium together in Washington. In 1993 Mr. Downe pleaded guilty to insider trading and securities fraud and in 2001, as Bill Clinton was preparing to leave the White House, Mr. Dodd successfully lobbied to get his friend a pardon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The following year, 2002, Mr. Dodd bought out Mr. Kessinger's two-thirds share in the house and became the full owner. Mr. Dodd reported to the Irish government that he paid Mr. Kessinger $122,351, and Mr. Dodd says that a bank appraisal that same year valued the property at $190,000. From 2002 to 2007 Mr. Dodd reported its worth at between $100,001 and $250,000 on his annual Senate financial disclosure form.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Hartford Courant columnist Kevin Rennie began digging this year into the mismatch between what Mr. Dodd paid to Mr. Downe's business partner to become a full owner and what the property in Ireland was likely worth in 2002 amid the Irish land boom. Last week, when Mr. Dodd filed his annual financial disclosure form, it included a new appraisal from the same appraiser putting the current value of the house at $658,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an effort to explain the gain despite the fact that the Irish housing market has since gone south, a spokesman for the Senator said that "The value of the cottage, or of Irish real estate generally, isn't something that the Dodds have thought much about." However, according to Galway County records, Mr. Dodd was so uninterested in the value of those 10 acres that he tried to subdivide the property in 1998 and put up another house. No doubt because he had no idea what it was, or would be, worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate's financial disclosure forms are supposed to be a tool of honest government, and former Senator Ted Stevens was indicted for allegedly false disclosures. Mr. Dodd's miraculous property reappraisal is further grist for Senate and Justice investigators -- and especially for voters in 2010.</p>

</p><div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">U.S. News: California Housing Market Shows Pockets of Recovery --- Prices Have Dropped Far Enough to Lure Buyers in a Trend Also Showing Up in Other Parts of the Country</span>
</div><div class="author">By Jim Carlton  </div><div>1109 words</div><div>20 June 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN JOSE, Calif. -- A home-sales revival that began last year in some of California's cheaper inland areas has begun to spread to several more expensive coastal areas, another hint that devastated real-estate markets in the state -- and other parts of the country -- may see less grim days ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes are selling briskly again in the lower end of the market in Santa Clara County, just south of San Francisco, with prospective buyers making multiple offers and bidding well above asking prices. The median sales price of a single-family home in May was $445,000 in the county, up 5.7% from February, when prices stopped dropping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Santa Clara County is one of several areas around the U.S. where prices have dropped far enough to lure buyers, including investors, back into the market. Other metro areas showing this trend include the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, parts of Phoenix and San Diego, said Ivy Zelman, chief executive of research firm Zelman &amp;Associates. Even in glutted markets like southern Florida, investors are "gobbling up distressed inventory" in some areas, she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Northern California, a big factor is first-time buyers like Denise and Steve Petrosky, who are newly optimistic about the market and can afford a home for the first time. The Petroskys in February paid $374,900 for a three-bedroom home in Morgan Hill, just south of San Jose, that last sold in 2006 for $610,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple were too leery to enter the market last year while prices were still heading down, said Mrs. Petrosky, 43 year old, an office manager, but felt prices had bottomed early this year. "Basically, we had set a budget what we could afford, which was below $400,000," Mrs. Petrosky said. "When the prices came down below that, we bought, because we could afford to."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are still falling in many California markets. But the state's average existing single-family home price has been inching up for two months, with the median sales price climbing to $256,700 in April from $247,590 in February. Much of that increase is thanks to a growing number of pockets of recovery in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Northern California, the median price has risen for four straight months in Santa Clara and for three months in Contra Costa County, according to estimates by MDA Dataquick Information Services, a market-research firm in La Jolla, Calif. In Southern California, the median price has risen or stayed the same three months in a row in Los Angeles County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those price increases might not presage a lasting resurgence in California's housing market. The state's high unemployment rate -- 11.5% in May -- could lead to more foreclosed homes that banks could then dump on the market. California's median home price remains down 37% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More broadly, Ms. Zelman and other housing economists cautioned against interpreting signs of greater sales activity as meaning the housing bust was nearly over. Interest rates on 30-year, fixed-rate prime mortgages have risen well above 5% in recent weeks and could rise further if inflation fears push up rates. A national tax credit for first-time home buyers ends Nov. 30, removing a big incentive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The overall economy in California hasn't gotten its footing," said Katherine Aguilar Perez, executive director of the Los Angeles office of the Urban Land Institute, an industry think tank. "So it's difficult for me to say we have hit bottom." Still, she said, "there are some pretty clear signals there is some leveling."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A look at Santa Clara County shows some of the dynamics behind the leveling. Home to Silicon Valley in the north, the county of 1.8 million residents went into the slump with the rest of the state, with county unemployment shooting above 10% this year from 5% in 2007. The median price of a previously owned home fell 48% to $420,000 in January from a high of $805,000 in August 2007, according to Dataquick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last year, the county's sales still lagged behind those in inland areas like Riverside and San Bernardino counties, where sales volumes were up 251% in November 2008 over November 2007, according to the California Association of Realtors. Santa Clara County's November sales were up only 16%. The inland sales were booming, in part, because prices fell further there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the lights seemed to turn back on in Santa Clara County home sales. Sales were up 40% in December, and kept rising into 2009. The median price, which had slid steadily since June 2008, stopped falling in February. The number of pending sales in the county has nearly doubled to 3,882 as of last week from 2,096 a year ago, according to the Santa Clara County Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest catalyst, local agents say, has been affordability. By April, the number of Santa Clara county residents who could afford a home in the county, based on household income, had jumped to 50% from 18% two years ago, said Quincy Virgilio, president of the Santa Clara County Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typical buyers are Scott and Yuriko Herbig. Mr. Herbig, a 28-year-old engineer, said they had a budget of less than $400,000, and couldn't find anything in that range when they began looking in 2008. Then, early this year, Mr. Herbig said, the market suddenly started filling with homes under $400,000. The couple in March bought a four-bedroom home in Gilroy for $362,000. "We got lucky," Mr. Herbig said. "I think we hit right at the bottom."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As in other areas of California, the hottest part of the Santa Clara market has been at the lower end -- in this area, that's under $600,000. For example, prices rose 15.6% to $540,000 in April in one zip code near downtown San Jose from $467,000 in January, according to Dataquick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, prices in some higher-income neighborhoods in Santa Clara County are still falling -- such as in parts of tonier towns like Cupertino and Los Gatos. Agents said that reflects borrowers' problems getting jumbo mortgages to make those purchases. Home prices are still falling in parts of San Francisco and San Diego County for the same reason, they said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Brian Blackstone and Justin Lahart </div><div>531 words</div><div>17 June 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family housing starts rose in May for the third straight month, fresh evidence the beleaguered housing market is beginning to stabilize. But the glut of homes in parts of the country will continue to drag down prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, another steep decline in industrial output served as a sober reminder that even if the 18-month-old recession is losing some steam, it shows no sign of actually ending, and a return to rapid expansion is unlikely for many months at least.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts jumped 17.2% in May from April to a 532,000 annual rate, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, boosted by an increase in multifamily units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family starts -- a less-volatile reading on housing trends -- rose 7.5% from April. Building permits rose as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This adds to evidence that the housing market is no longer falling apart," said Mike Larson, an analyst at Weiss Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, home construction was well below year-ago levels, with the pace of starts down 45.2% from May 2008. A flurry of construction during the boom led to a glut of new homes that has weighed on the building sector. There were more than 10 times as many homes for sale in April as sold during that month; typically, that ratio is closer to six. Layoffs and tight credit also are holding back home buying, and mortgage rates are rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with builders cutting prices deeply to clear out unsold homes, inventory levels may have fallen to the point where demand for new homes is in line with supply, at least in some areas.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. housing sector may have finally found its footing while inflationary pressures remain muted, government reports released Tuesday showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, another steep decline in industrial output served as a sober reminder that even if the 18-month-old recession is losing some of its steam, it shows no sign of actually ending, and a return to rapid expansion is unlikely for many months at least.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts jumped 17.2% in May from April to a 532,000 annual rate, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, more than twice the gain economists in a Dow Jones Newswires survey had expected. Building permits, a leading indicator, rose as well. And single-family starts -- which economists tend to focus on for a less-volatile reading on housing trends -- rose 7.5% from April, their third straight rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This adds to evidence that the housing market is no longer falling apart," said Mike Larson, an analyst at Weiss Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the problems of the housing sector are far from over. Inventories are still far too high relative to sales, while layoffs and tight credit are holding back home buying. Meanwhile, mortgage rates have started rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The inventory overhang means any recovery in building will be very muted for an extended period, but at least the very worst is over," said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news on housing was offset by another grim report on the state of U.S. manufacturing. Industrial production tumbled 1.1% in May from April, the Federal Reserve said. Capacity utilization fell to 68.3%, well below its long-run average, an indication there is still a great deal of disinflationary slack in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest production figures are somewhat at odds with survey-based measures suggesting signs of stabilization in manufacturing. Industrial production, along with nonfarm payrolls, "are the two best indicators of the economy, and they still look horrible," said Zach Pandl, economist at Nomura.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday, an economic advisory committee of the American Bankers Association said it expects the recession to end in the third quarter, and top Fed officials have said they expect a return to growth later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, "to me, looking at the data, it's not a slam-dunk case that the recession will end in 2009," Mr. Pandl said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reflecting the weak economy, U.S. producer prices posted their largest annual decline in 60 years last month, a Labor Department report showed, easing some of the inflation fears that have crept into the bond market in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The producer-price index for finished goods advanced 0.2% in May from April, much less than the 0.6% rise that economists had expected. The PPI was down 5% from a year ago, the biggest decline since August 1949.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The core PPI, which excludes food and energy, slid 0.1% from April, the first decline since October 2006. Economists had expected a 0.1% rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's data suggest that while deflation risks may be waning amid rising oil prices, the falling U.S. dollar and apparent stabilization in the economy, there is little evidence that inflation is taking root.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yields on U.S. Treasury securities have risen sharply in recent weeks on a mix of firmer economic data, soaring budget deficits and concerns that massive monetary and fiscal stimulus will eventually lead to inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PPI data should limit those fears somewhat: "With the amount of spare capacity at a 40-year high, there is little prospect of the surge in gasoline prices leading to a sustained period of worryingly high inflation," said Paul Dales, economist at Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the American Bankers Association report, the group projected that inflation-adjusted gross domestic product will rebound, picking up to a pace in excess of 3% in the second half of the year, spurred in part by a recovery in the battered housing sector. It forecast a rise in home starts this year with home prices moving "modestly higher" next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the ABA's advisory committee predicted that credit would remain tight and warned that U.S. unemployment will continue to rise, peaking at a 10% rate in 2010.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Walsh, the lead executive who loaded <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc</span>. with toxic property investments, is part of a group chosen by Lehman to take over the bankrupt firm's real-estate private-equity arm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Walsh and a team of former Lehman colleagues are setting up a new stand-alone business to manage the private-equity portfolio. They stand to profit if the portfolio of distressed assets -- for which they once paid top dollar -- recovers only some of its value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arrangement is a remarkable second act for 49-year-old Mr. Walsh, formerly Lehman's global head of real estate. When it filed for bankruptcy protection last September, Lehman directly held roughly $43 billion worth of real-estate loans and assets, exposure that played a key role in its collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal prosecutors continue to investigate, among other things, whether Mr. Walsh and his team improperly valued commercial-real-estate holdings to prop up Lehman's balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey Attorney General Anne Milgram also has filed a civil suit against Mr. Walsh and others accusing them of defrauding the state's pension funds by misrepresenting the value of Lehman's real-estate holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lawyer for Mr. Walsh declined to comment</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While helping strike deals using Lehman's own balance sheet, Mr. Walsh also oversaw a separate unit called Lehman Brothers Real Estate Partners. Set up as a trio of private-equity funds, the unit eventually invested in $5.6 billion worth of deals, attracting some of the nation's largest pension funds as backers. Lehman itself also contributed about 20% of the unit's capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Properties in the portfolio include the 34-story InterContinental hotel in New York's Times Square, 60 hotels in the United Kingdom, and a commercial-real-estate development in Mumbai called Santa Cruz. About three-quarters of the portfolio is located outside the U.S. And it is valued at about 50% of its original purchase price, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To maximize recovery for creditors, Lehman's restructuring advisers <span class="companylink">Alvarez &amp; Marsal</span> have been trying to find a buyer for the unit since late last year. Dozens of prospective buyers expressed interest, but it winnowed the group to five finalists, including <span class="companylink">AREA Property Partners</span>, formerly <span class="companylink">Apollo Real Estate Advisors LP</span>, and a group led by Raymond Mikulich, the former co-head of the group who left the firm in early 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman's estate eventually chose a management group that had run the business for years, which includes Mr. Walsh and executives Brett Bossung and Mark Newman. Lehman will retain its roughly 20% stake and hold seats on the new firm's oversight committees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group paid about $10 million for the business, according to a person familiar with the deal. The number was low, say people familiar with the matter, because continuing management fees are likely to be consumed by the costs of managing the existing properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund also will shrink the size of its most recent vehicle, a $3.2 billion fund, closed just days before Lehman's collapse. The fund will forgo about $1.6 billion in uninvested capital from investors, limiting new management fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The funds' new managers and Lehman creditors will thus only profit if the value of the properties increase over time. Lehman's investors agreed to "reset' some incentive fees for the managers, giving them payouts if asset values rise above their current distressed levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically managers would receive 20% of the "carry," or cut of certain profits, but that figure is expected to be lower for the new management, according to people familiar with the transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We fully support this management team and believe not only that they are best equipped to maximize the value of the assets," a Lehman spokeswoman said, "but also that they will be extremely successful in the growth of the new platform."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transaction follows similar spinouts by the Lehman estate, including its flagship private-equity fund and its venture-capital unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest of those deals was a management buyout of Neuberger Berman, Lehman's money-management unit, which is 51% owned by its employees, with Lehman retaining the balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lehman group's sale comes at a time of crisis for the real-estate fund industry. During the boom years, funds run by Wall Street banks and boutique firms funneled billions of dollars from pension funds and other big investors into highly levered bets on office buildings, shopping malls, warehouses and other commercial property around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Funds at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> and elsewhere have been marked down by more than half their equity value. Industry experts and investors, known as limited partners, expect the losses to mount.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A green-tinted glass office tower in Chicago's Loop is at the heart of a dispute that highlights the issues facing even well-occupied properties acquired with commercial-mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, at the height of the last real-estate boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story dates back to 2006, when <span class="companylink">Younan Properties Inc</span>., a company formed in 2002 by Iranian immigrant Zaya Younan, pulled off its biggest deal since its founding: the acquisition of a seven-building portfolio of office buildings in Dallas and the Chicago region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller was <span class="companylink">Transwestern Investment Co</span>., and the deal was financed through the sale of $224 million in CMBS and $36.5 million in mezzanine debt, according to Realpoint LLC, a Horsham, Pa.-based rating agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, the debt was transferred by the servicer, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span>., to a special servicer, LNR Partners Inc. This typically means a loan is either behind in payments or is not meeting certain loan obligations, according to Harris Trifon, a director in the CMBS ratings group of <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Ratings Services. LNR declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Younan says the loan was transferred to a special servicer because his company disagreed with the original mortgage servicer, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, about the use of the reserve fund on one of the properties, the 30-story 200 N. LaSalle. He declined to elaborate. But an S&amp;P report in January said the borrower requested draws from reserve to finance interior work related to a lease and <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> denied the request.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spat between <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> and Mr. Younan over the reserve fund is complicated because Mr. Younan disagrees with others who are monitoring the loan's progress over the degree of the building's problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Ratings Services and Realpoint say that, as of June, 200 N. LaSalle was 90 days or more delinquent on its $92 million mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loan's trustee, LaSalle Global Trust Services, a unit of the <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>., agrees with this assessment, according to a recent LaSalle report, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a comment section related to the 200 N. LaSalle loan the report states: "Discussions with the Borrower regarding potential resolution scenarios are ongoing." <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Younan says 200 N. LaSalle's payments are current and the loan is "absolutely" not delinquent. He says the only issue is the use of the reserve fund, and that that is being resolved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Younan, who once told the Chicago Sun-Times he planned to develop the world's tallest building, says the credit crunch will delay but not derail his plans to create one of the world's largest real estate companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His company owns more than 12 million square feet of office space, according to its Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He predicts he will soon get 200 N. LaSalle out of the hands of the special servicer. "It's a healthy property," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Younan, 46 years old, has had some successes with the property, which is centrally located near Chicago's city hall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, CareerBuilder, which operates one of the nation's largest online job sites, expanded from about 70,000 square feet into about 150,000 square feet in the tower, where it now has its global corporate headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The City of Chicago provided about $2.5 million to CareerBuilder to help with the roughly $11.6 million cost of rehabbing and constructing the headquarters space in exchange for the company's promise to keep and add jobs in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, the building's vacancy rate is only about 8.7%, according to real-estate data provider CoStar. That is well below the 15.2% vacancy of the East Loop submarket where it is located, according to Property &amp; Portfolio Research Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the dispute triggered by the reserve fund could potentially affect the other six properties Younan bought in the Transwestern deal, which are all current on their mortgages. That is because when the Transwestern deal was financed through the $224 million CMBS sale, all the properties were "cross-collateralized," according to S&amp;P.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means that if one property became delinquent, the cash flow from the other properties could be tapped to service the debt. Indeed, when the $92 million mortgage was transferred to the special servicer in January, so was the debt on the other properties, according to S&amp;P.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Younan declined to comment on the cross-collateralization matter.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family housing starts rose in May for the third straight month, fresh evidence the beleaguered housing market is beginning to stabilize. But the glut of homes in parts of the country will continue to drag down prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, another steep decline in industrial output served as a sober reminder that even if the 18-month-old recession is losing some steam, it shows no sign of actually ending, and a return to rapid expansion is unlikely for many months at least.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts jumped 17.2% in May from April to a 532,000 annual rate, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, boosted by an increase in multifamily units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family starts -- a less-volatile reading on housing trends -- rose 7.5% from April. Building permits rose as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This adds to evidence that the housing market is no longer falling apart," said Mike Larson, an analyst at Weiss Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, home construction was well below year-ago levels, with the pace of starts down 45.2% from May 2008. A flurry of construction during the boom led to a glut of new homes that has weighed on the building sector. There were more than 10 times as many homes for sale in April as sold during that month; typically, that ratio is closer to six. Layoffs and tight credit also are holding back home buying, and mortgage rates are rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with builders cutting prices deeply to clear out unsold homes, inventory levels may have fallen to the point where demand for new homes is in line with supply, at least in some areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it reported quarterly results earlier this month, builder <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>. said it had a five-month supply of unsold homes in Phoenix, down from 25 months 1½ years earlier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Confidence faltered in June among U.S. home builders, left uneasy by a rise in mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A market sentiment index published monthly by the National Association of Home Builders dipped this month. The gauge reflects builder confidence in sales of new, single-family houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in the NAHB's housing market index reported Monday, to 15 from 16 in May, followed two months of increases that had nurtured hopes of a bottom to the housing crisis. Signs have surfaced this spring indicating the worst of the recession is past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But mortgage rates have climbed in recent weeks, pushed by rising government bond yields. Investors are concerned about inflation because of increased spending in Washington meant to pull the economy out of recession. <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> data showed the average on a 30-year mortgage loan was 5.59% last week -- 73 basis points higher than the average four weeks earlier of 4.86%, an advance that could hurt demand for houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market continues to bump along trying to find a bottom," NAHB chief economist David Crowe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales have gone up twice in the latest three-month period. Affordability has gone up with the long, deep slide in prices; there was a 15% drop, year over year, in April alone, the latest data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But used homes, driven down sharply in price by a wave of foreclosures, are competing with the new-home market. Layoffs and tight credit have also slowed new-home sales. Inventories of unsold homes are high; the ratio of homes for sale to houses sold in April exceeded 10 months. As a result, home construction fell 13% in April compared to March. Construction year over year was less than half the April 2008 level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An HMI component that measures current sales conditions held steady at 14. An index gauging traffic of prospective buyers also stayed flat, at 13. An index gauging sales expectations in the next six months slipped to 26 from 27.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builders are taking their cue from consumers, who remain uncertain about the economy and their own situation," Crowe said. "Builders are also finding it difficult to complete a sale because customers cannot sell their existing homes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAHB's overall HMI for June was based on a survey of 548 home builders, who answer questions about sales prospects now and in the near term. When the index exceeds 50, it means the number of builders who see "good" sales outnumber the number who see "poor" sales. The numbers used in compiling the index are adjusted for seasonal variations.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ethan Smith   </div><div>1355 words</div><div>13 June 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS OLIVOS, Calif. -- After he was acquitted of child molestation charges in 2005, associates say, Michael Jackson vowed he would never return to Neverland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2,600-acre estate, named for a magical place where children never age, has since yielded to reality and time. The amusement-park rides, elephants and orangutans have been hauled away. The two helicopter landing pads are empty. The private railway line stands idle and the ornate "Neverland" gates that framed the driveway are in storage. Bats hang over the doorway to the building that housed Mr. Jackson's private arcade; guano stains the threshold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now the ranch is playing a role in an effort to rehabilitate Mr. Jackson's finances. Since January, more than 80 workers have been toiling at the ranch as part of a plan by real-estate investment firm <span class="companylink">Colony Capital LLC</span> to convert the former money pit into a lucrative asset. The company has spent more than $3 million on landscaping and repairs to the property's electrical and plumbing systems. Soon Colony plans to bring in a small herd of Clydesdales to show visitors some signs of life on the all-but-abandoned estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kyle Forsyth, Colony's project manager, describes the estate's Tudor-style buildings and savannah-like grasslands as "English country manor meets Kenya." Eventually, Colony hopes to sell the ranch, located in Santa Barbara County, in its entirety. Subdividing it, says Mr. Forsyth, "would destroy it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state of Neverland is a reminder of the excesses that precipitated Mr. Jackson's financial decline. In his years at the ranch, he stuffed it with items ranging from antique furniture to arcade-style videogames. After he was twice accused of molesting boys on the property, he had to shell out for high-priced legal teams. No criminal charges were brought the first time around, in 1993, and he reached a settlement in a civil lawsuit. In the second case, he was acquitted of criminal charges in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 50-year-old singer's debts now stand at around $500 million, according to three people familiar with his finances. The value of Mr. Jackson's biggest assets -- music copyrights that include 251 Beatles songs as well as his own compositions -- probably still exceed his growing debt, according to these people. Mr. Jackson's manager said the singer wasn't available for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last spring, Mr. Jackson defaulted on a $24.5 million loan backed by the ranch. Los Angeles-based Colony bought the note for $23 million and put the title into a joint venture it formed with the singer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Neverland is brought back to life, concert promoter <span class="companylink">AEG Live</span> is trying to resurrect Mr. Jackson's music career. He is booked to play 50 shows at London's O2 arena over several months starting in July. If all goes according to plan, Mr. Jackson could make as much as $50 million, according to people familiar with financial details of the shows. Adding dates in Europe, Asia and North America could net him $400 million, these people say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Jackson has already delayed the first four shows in London, citing a need for additional dress rehearsals. In April, he pulled out of a plan to auction most of the personal effects and furnishings from Neverland. And he recently parted ways with Tohme Tohme, a Colony Capital business associate who for several months acted as his manager, striking the deals for the Neverland joint venture, the auction and the London concerts. Taking Dr. Tohme's place is Frank DiLeo, Mr. Jackson's manager from 1984 to 1989. Mr. Jackson didn't offer an explanation for the change, according to associates notified about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. DiLeo declined to comment. Dr. Tohme said: "I wish [Mr. Jackson] all the best."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it attempts to turn Neverland into a salable property, Colony is trying to walk a fine line between removing the taint of scandal while preserving enough of Mr. Jackson's quirks to remind potential buyers why the property is so famous in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before it puts the estate on the market, Colony plans to change its name and allow local charities to use it to host fund-raisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think we made a very smart real-estate deal that was to the benefit of Michael and Colony," says the real-estate firm's chief executive, Tom Barrack. He believes the estate could fetch $70 million to $90 million, in which case Mr. Jackson could also realize a tidy profit. "Should Michael Jackson's career be reaccelerated, it will have substantial additional value."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property now known as Neverland was built in 1981 by real-estate developer William Bone, who named it Sycamore Valley Ranch. The main house's 13,000-square-foot interior is still trimmed in the oak paneling installed by Mr. Bone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jackson paid $19.5 million for the ranch in 1987 and rechristened it Neverland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the $35 million worth of amenities he added were enough amusement-park rides for a state fair, a zoo, a go-kart track and two separate railway lines -- one large enough to accommodate full-sized antique steam engines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 50-seat theater features state-of-the-art projection and sound systems, a private viewing balcony, and a stage that includes trap doors for magicians' assistants. Mr. Jackson converted a rustic red barn into a herpetarium with displays for a dozen exotic and venomous snakes, including a Burmese python and a monocled cobra. He created a Neverland Valley Fire Department, with a small fleet of working engines and full-time firefighters who were occasionally dispatched to battle brushfires on neighboring properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its peak, Neverland boasted a staff of 150, and cost $10 million a year to maintain, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jackson spent more than 15 years living at the ranch. He wrote songs for 1991's "Dangerous" album while sitting in a treehouse overlooking the estate's four-acre pond. His three children were home-schooled on the third floor of the main house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jackson also used the property for guests, ranging from attendees of high-priced fund-raisers to local school kids and children with cancer or other serious illnesses. The property's theater was built with two isolation rooms so that immune-compromised chemotherapy patients could watch movies without being exposed to other children's germs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After being acquitted of the criminal charges in a 2005 jury trial in nearby Santa Maria, Mr. Jackson left Neverland for destinations that included Dubai, Bahrain and London. People close to the singer say he didn't return to Neverland largely because he felt traumatized by the events surrounding his arrest and trial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last fall, Mr. Jackson moved to Los Angeles' high-end Hotel Bel Air from the Las Vegas area. In a bid to save money, he settled into a nearby $100,000-a-month rental property in January, according to Dr. Tohme.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Colony seeks to remove some reminders of Mr. Jackson's tenure, company executives recognize that the singer's imprint remains. Mr. Forsyth says express-mail delivery drivers stopped taking packages to the property when they were addressed to "Sycamore Valley Ranch," because they didn't recognize the name. For official correspondence, the ranch for now is called "Sycamore Valley/Neverland."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one corner of the property sits Mr. Jackson's old tour bus: a mustard-yellow recreational vehicle with six-foot-high portraits of the Three Stooges painted on the outside. The Victorian-style "train station" has been restored. A stone-and-flower rendering of Mr. Jackson's logo for the property -- a child's silhouette, seated on a crescent moon -- still adorns a hillside. The company hasn't decided whether to scrap an elaborate fort and a make-believe "Indian village."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can't wipe out Neverland entirely," says Mr. Forsyth. "It's part of the history of the place."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lingling Wei and Kris Hudson   </div><div>883 words</div><div>10 June 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the commercial real-estate industry bracing itself for the onslaught of hundreds of billions of dollars in maturing loans, the Treasury is considering issuing rules that will make it easier for property developers and investors and their loan servicers to restructure debt, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax rules make it difficult for borrowers who are current on their payments to hold restructuring talks with the servicers of commercial mortgages that were packaged and sold as bonds. This lack of flexibility was one of the reasons cited by the management of mall giant <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties Inc</span>. for its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At present, developers and investors complain that only those who are delinquent can talk to servicers of these bonds, named commercial-mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS. But now the Treasury is considering issuing guidance that would allow servicers to start talking about ways to avoid defaults and foreclosures sooner, possibly at least two years ahead of the maturity date of a loan, these people said. The Treasury guidance, which could be released within weeks, would essentially enable loan-modification talks to take place without triggering tax consequences, these people say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This issue is critical. We are hopeful that Treasury acts soon, as each day the commercial-real-estate markets deteriorate further," said Jeffrey DeBoer, chief executive of the Real Estate Roundtable, a lobbying body for the commercial-real-estate industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The possible move by the Treasury reflects the deep concern in government and industry circles of the problems looming in the $6.5 trillion market for commercial real estate. Just as the U.S. economy is struggling to regain its footing, defaults are mounting because of credit-market turmoil, along with declining property cash flows and plunging property values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a hearing Tuesday on the Obama administration's bank-rescue program, some lawmakers warned that commercial real estate could deal a punishing blow to lenders and the economy. "I am very concerned about the ticking time bomb we face," said congressional Joint Economic Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney (D., N.Y.).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of particular concern is $154.5 billion of CMBS loans coming due between now and 2012. About two-thirds of that likely won't qualify for refinancing, according to a recent report by <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>. The bank projected that the default rates on the $700 billion of outstanding CMBS eventually could hit at least 30%, and loss rates, which take into account the amounts recovered by lenders, could reach as much as 13%, more than the peak seen during the commercial-real-estate collapse of the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CMBS delinquency rates have more than tripled in just six months, to 2.7% in May, their highest point in a decade. The likely spike in commercial-mortgage defaults and foreclosures could cost the nation's already fragile financial system hundreds of billions of dollars in losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But property owners and investors hoping to restructure troubled mortgages are hearing a tough message from CMBS servicers: We can't talk to you unless you first fall behind on payments. This is because when CMBS offerings are created, the underlying mortgages are legally held by tax-free trusts. The trusts can be forced to pay taxes if the underlying loans are modified before they become delinquent, according to current CMBS rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It can be frustrating," says Monty Bennett, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Ashford Hospitality Trust Inc</span>. The Dallas-based real-estate investment trust that owns 102 upscale hotels has tried to start negotiations with servicers for extensions of payment deadlines for CMBS loans coming due. They have had little success. "You're trying to be proactive and get a plan together to address [a loan maturity], but you can't get someone to talk to you."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Sunstone Hotel Investors Inc</span>., a REIT that owns 43 hotel properties, ended up taking drastic action this month to end a negotiating stalemate with a CMBS loan servicer. Unable to get the servicer to agree to lower payments to reflect the deteriorating cash flow of the 258-room W San Diego hotel, Sunstone skipped its June 1 payment on the hotel's $65 million mortgage. Thus, Sunstone effectively invited the servicer, Centerline Servicing Inc., to foreclose on the W San Diego, which Sunstone estimates is worth less than its mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunstone executives say the complicated structure of CMBS deals makes it difficult for borrowers to get a servicer to discuss a loan modification in the first place. In many cases, the only way to force the servicer to come to the table is to allow the loan to go into default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What makes the system great is also what makes it weak," said Sunstone President and Chief Executive Arthur Buser. "It's systemized, heavily documented, heavily structured with a lot of rules that allow loans to be cut up and sold. That means there cannot be a high degree of variability and audible calls on what can be done."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes listed for sale declined again in many U.S. cities last month, though supplies are generally plentiful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes available for sale in 28 major metropolitan areas at the end of May was down 3.9% from a month earlier, according to figures compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a real-estate brokerage firm based in Emeryville, Calif. The ZipRealty data cover all single-family homes, condominiums and town houses listed on local multiple-listing services in metro areas where the firm operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a national basis over the past 25 years, inventories typically have shown little change in May from April levels, according to Zelman &amp;Associates, a research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with the year-earlier month, the May inventory in the 28 metro areas was down 24%. The National Association of Realtors says about four million homes were listed for sale nationwide at the end of April. That was down about 11% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exact level of supply remains unclear because the figures from the Realtors and Zip do not include all of the foreclosed homes that banks are preparing to sell. According to some industry estimates, as many as half of those homes are not included on multiple-listing services at any given time. Some foreclosed homes are not listed because they are being offered as rentals; others are awaiting repairs or are subject to litigation or other delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite those uncertainties, Thomas Lawler, a housing economist in Leesburg, Va., says the recent decline in inventories and the slow pace of home construction "indicate that home prices in many parts of the country could be nearing a bottom." Integrated Asset Services LLC, Denver, reported Tuesday that its national house price index in April was unchanged from a month earlier and down 13% from April 2008. A recent uptick in mortgage interest rates is likely to deter some potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Zip data do not include New York City. But Miller Samuel Inc., an appraisal firm, reports there were 9,551 cooperative apartments and condominiums on the market in Manhattan at the end of May. That was down 8% from a month earlier but up 9% from May 2008.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Suzanne Barlyn   </div><div>1619 words</div><div>8 June 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(See corrections and amplifications item below.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vacation homes, once a sign of prosperity, have become financial burdens to many amid the economic slump. With a little creativity, however, it is possible for owners to squeeze extra cash from properties that might otherwise be a drain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people who bought second homes as national real-estate prices peaked during 2006 now have less money to pay the bills and are facing the unenviable choice of selling at a loss—if they can—or waiting out the market. The median price of a vacation home fell 23% in 2008 from 2007, according to the National Association of Realtors, and sales have dropped nearly 31% from 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Second homes have become an ugly stepchild in an environment [where] people aren’t even buying first homes,” says Cicily Maton, a financial planner for Aequus Wealth Management Resources LLC in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners who are stuck with those homes can try to make do, at least temporarily, by using their homes to produce extra income and minimize taxes. Some options, such as refinancing to a more favorable loan or delaying improvements, are obvious. Others require more planning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With that in mind, here are some ideas about how to keep a vacation home afloat on less money:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Become a Landlord</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people who once used their vacation homes solely for their own enjoyment are now renting them out, says Sarah Kuzma, corporate relations director for Meyer Real Estate in Gulf Shores, Ala. A second income stream, in addition to tax write-offs for maintenance and repairs, makes this option appealing in many cases, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners can hold on to more of that rental income by marketing the property themselves. An effective do-it-yourself Internet campaign can cost less than $500, compared with the 10% to 25% of total rental income that real-estate agents and management companies may charge to find tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jack Russell of Lexington, Ky., who bought a five-bedroom vacation home in Kiawah Island, S.C., in 2004, has chosen the do-it-yourself route. For $249, he advertised his home on a Web site called Vacation Rentals By Owner, or VRBO.com[http://www.vrbo.com]. A <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> group he started at no charge directs users to that ad. He also advertised on <span class="companylink">Google</span>, which produced hundreds of clicks, for about $200 during a three-month period, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strategies have generated substantial interest, says Mr. Russell, who expects to rent the property for 26 weeks per year. A property-management company oversees cleaning and inspections of the home, which rents for $7,600 per week during the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renting a property for even one or two weeks can produce found money. Homeowners can rent their property for up to 14 days without reporting the income to the Internal Revenue Service, says Michael Kay, a certified financial planner in Livingston, N.J. The strategy can produce a windfall for people who own property in areas that hold one-time annual events, such as the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Help Yourself—and Others</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donating vacation-home use to a charity that auctions the time to raise cash provides a tax break that could help homeowners in softening vacation rental markets, such as Malibu, Calif., and Kauai, Hawaii.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Honore Frumentino of Northbook, Ill., donated her vacation home in Palm Bay, Fla., to two silent auctions—one that benefited a church and another to help defray medical costs of a seriously ill community member. Typically, people who attend the auction bid on the vacation week and pay the sum to the charity. The homeowner can, in many cases, then deduct the fair market rental value from his or her income taxes, regardless of the amount paid to the charity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some companies offer online services that link vacation-home donors with charities that want to auction vacation time. VacationHomesForCharity.org[http://VacationHomesForCharity.org]is one such Web site. Run by The Society of Leisure Enthusiasts, a Denver company that provides marketing support to vacation homeowners and rental companies, the service lists donated vacation-home time free of charge and negotiates with charities to contribute a small portion of rental proceeds toward the owner’s cleaning costs. Property owners can mandate their own rules, such as bans on pets or smoking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many retirees decide to settle down in a longtime family vacation home. But some treasured locations are becoming more difficult to afford as retirement portfolios and incomes decline. Donating a home to charity, while retaining a life estate—the right to live in the house until death—can generate a substantial tax deduction that can stretch across several years, according to Rawson Hubbell, vice president, investment management and trust, at <span class="companylink">Boston Private Bank &amp; Trust Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He recently advised a 65-year-old couple, who live in a $2 million lakefront home in New Hampshire, to set up a charitable life estate. Too much of the couple’s net worth was tied up in the home, whose mortgage had been paid off, he says. The couple was expecting a significant payout of deferred compensation, which is taxable as income. He suggested setting up a charitable life estate to offset that burden, leaving them more money for spending. A charity would own the property after their deaths, but the couple would receive a $900,000 tax deduction, which could put as much as $315,000 in their pockets over five years, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally, people can deduct up to 30% of their adjusted gross income for this type of gift, so a deduction this large is best planned for a year in which there is a major taxable event, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple has no children, but those who do and want to leave something behind may have to weigh other options, such as selling or living on less cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appeal Your Taxes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property taxes are becoming more burdensome for many vacation homeowners, particularly as more municipalities try to make up for budget shortfalls by raising taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Rubino, a tax attorney in Stamford, Conn., says property-tax appeals are now more common. Many homeowners whose properties were reassessed when the real-estate market peaked are stuck with high values for tax purposes, even though prices have since declined. “People aren’t very happy about that,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get a reduction, homeowners must argue the valuation is wrong, either because an appraiser compared the home with properties that weren’t equivalent, or made a mistake, such as miscalculating square footage, says Mr. Rubino.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Carmichael, a property tax lawyer in Eugene, Ore., says he is helping a friend appeal taxes on land in Bend, Ore., a city near the Cascade Mountains. The property cost $100,000 in April, but the tax assessor recognizes $310,000 as its real market value, says Mr. Carmichael. He plans to use that discrepancy to argue a tax appeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property taxes in Oregon, he says, are based on either assessed or real market value, whichever is lower. He is hoping the assessor will reduce the property’s real market value, for tax purposes, to $100,000, which would be less than half the 2008 assessment of $239,270. The owner’s property taxes could decline by more than $2,000 annually if the appeal is successful, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners need to weigh, however, if the savings will outweigh legal costs. Some attorneys will work on a contingency basis, typically charging one-third of the taxes a homeowner saves if the appeal is successful. Others may charge between $200 and $300 per hour, regardless of who wins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Share the Load</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some owners run vacation homes like businesses. Finding a partner to purchase an interest in the home and contribute to overhead expenses could relieve some of the burden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best partner isn’t necessarily a friend or relative, but someone who will adhere to a written agreement that outlines responsibilities, income and a schedule for personal use, says Andy Chapman, president of Halo Business Advisors in Clinton, Miss. “Make sure you get either your share of the income or time,” he says. These types of investment properties typically operate through a legal structure, such as a limited liability corporation or general partnership. A lawyer or accountant can determine the most appropriate option for minimizing taxes and liability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many families set up family limited partnerships or family limited liability companies to reduce a property’s value for estate-planning purposes. Giving relatives an immediate ownership interest in a property, instead of making them wait until the owner dies, may inspire them to contribute to the home’s upkeep. “It doesn’t need to be looked at only as an estate-planning tool but as a way of sharing wealth and also the burdens,” says Mr. Kay, the financial planner in Livingston, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, the home’s owners set up a general partnership or company and then give shares to family members. They’re often difficult for recipients to sell or convey, making the property less valuable, which can help minimize estate taxes. Mr. Kay warns, however, to follow IRS guidelines about discounting the property’s value in a fair and reasonable manner. The IRS has scrutinized what he calls “ridiculous” discounts. “They have problems when people get greedy,” he says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty and John Spence </div><div>518 words</div><div>4 June 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders reported encouraging signs of stabilization in the housing market, but they cautioned that foreclosures and rising interest rates cloud the outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two big builders, <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>., said losses in the fiscal second quarter ended April 30 shrank from year-earlier levels as lower prices lured some buyers back into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report Wednesday from IHS Global Insight, a research firm in Lexington, Mass., said home prices on average fell at an annual rate of 2.2% in this year's first quarter, compared with a 12.5% rate in the fourth quarter of 2008. The report is based on price data from the Federal Housing Finance Agency. In the latest quarter, prices were down in 199 of 330 metropolitan areas examined in the study. In the fourth quarter, 312 metro areas showed declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While it's too early to see a bottom of this housing downturn," the report said, the latest data "may signal that the market is beginning to stabilize."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the biggest worries are rising unemployment and increases in the foreclosure rate. Foreclosure actions were initiated on 1.4% of first-lien home mortgages in this year's first quarter, up from 1.0% a year earlier, the Mortgage Bankers Association said last week. Meanwhile, after falling to their lowest levels since the 1950s, mortgage interest rates have increased. In the week ended May 29, the average interest rate for new 30-year fixed-rate mortgages jumped to 5.25% from 4.81% a week earlier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SPRINGFIELD, Mo. -- Losses at the police and firefighters' pension fund have thrown this Ozark city into its worst budget crisis in decades. The city wants to slash spending on health care, parks and roads. Skunk trapping may have to go, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the pension fund's problems: It's an investor in a $1.1 billion speculative office skyscraper rising in New York's Times Square in the middle of a commercial-property bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That folks in places like Springfield wound up owning a piece of one of the biggest real-estate gambles in America is indicative of how widely today's commercial-property collapse has spread. Some in the industry believe the damage will be deeper than the previous crash of the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sector's woes are considered a major threat to economic recovery. There is some $3.5 trillion in commercial-real-estate debt outstanding -- more than the amount for auto loans, credit cards and student loans combined. And the default rate is rising sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past decade, Wall Street unleashed a wave of "securitized" commercial-real-estate debt, just as it did in residential mortgages. Some $700 billion worth of commercial-real-estate mortgages were sliced up, packaged into securities and sold to a wide range of investors -- meaning that this time, the pain will be felt by many more players beyond banks and thrifts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pension funds, foundations and college endowments became more active players in real estate. Real estate as a percentage of the average portfolio for such institutions doubled in the past 10 years to close to 11%, according to Institutional Real Estate Inc. and Kingsley Associates, two real-estate consulting companies. Between 2000 and 2007, these institutions sank more than $355 billion into real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some pension plans bought real estate directly. Others invested through funds managed by Wall Street firms and insurance companies such as <span class="companylink">Prudential Financial Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The police and firefighters of Springfield are one of 272 pension funds, foundations and endowments that invested in a pooled real-estate fund managed by <span class="companylink">Prudential Real Estate</span> Investors, a unit of Prudential. The insurance giant's fund is the major backer of a Manhattan office building called 11 Times Square. That building is the largest of $2.6 billion in commercial projects across the U.S. that the Prudential fund has committed to pay for over the next three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May 2007, Prudential predicted average rents of $110 a square foot for the 1.1-million-square-foot Times Square edifice, and that it would be fully leased by June 2011, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. By October 2008, Prudential was saying the building wouldn't be fully leased until June 2012 and would garner rent of $99 a square foot. The New York office market has fallen since then; rents in 11 Times Square's neighborhood were about $69 a square foot in the first quarter of this year, down nearly 9% from $76 a year earlier, according to research firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given the deterioration in the midtown Manhattan office market, the financial performance of 11 Times Square will not be what we expected," said Kevin R. Smith, who manages the Prudential fund, known as PRISA, in a statement. "We continue to believe tenants will demand state-of-the-art office space, so we are confident the property is a good investment for PRISA over the long term."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Losses for many such funds are now mounting. Some, including more highly leveraged funds run by <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, have written down more than half their equity value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prudential has marked down the $12.4 billion fund backing 11 Times Square by 32% from one year ago. Fund managers are telling investors to expect as much as 20% in further write-downs this year, according to documents reviewed by the Journal. Investors have lined up to take $1.5 billion out of the fund, but Prudential has stopped funding redemption requests, according to fund documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comparable funds have been written down 27% for the past year, according to the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries, an institutional real-estate-investment trade group, and many have also stopped funding redemptions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We wanted a small portion of our portfolio in real estate, but we also wanted something that was as safe as possible in terms of the investment risk," says Evelyn Honea, president of the Springfield pension board, explaining its January 2007 decision to invest with Prudential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Honea says the investment is a long-term one. "Would they have invested in a building of that size in New York if they had seen this coming? Probably not," she says of 11 Times Square. "But hindsight's 20-20 vision, unfortunately."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Pozycki, the New Jersey developer of 11 Times Square, limited his own risk in the project: PRISA provided nearly all of the equity. He had reason to be cautious. Mr. Pozycki says he put up millions of dollars of his own money after one of his speculative real-estate projects soured in the 1990s recession, though eventually the building was leased and delivered a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every day I learn something about how to position ourselves and not take a risk," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prudential had tried development in Times Square before. Two decades ago, the Newark, N.J., company spent hundreds of millions of dollars of its own on an ill-fated effort to redevelop Times Square, then a seedy area of peep shows and vacant buildings. By the mid-1990s, with office towers still on the drawing board after recession and legal battles, Prudential started selling off its sites, some at big discounts. At the time, Prudential was selling much of the real estate on its balance sheet to reduce risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But years later, as Times Square became a thriving business center, Prudential executives who managed PRISA saw an opportunity. To boost returns and put to work money that pension funds were depositing at record levels, PRISA was funding an increasing amount of development. During the boom years, developments helped PRISA scoop up investments and fees. In 2005, PRISA's annual return was close to 25%. The next year, investors deposited $2.5 billion into the fund. Last year, when PRISA posted a 13% loss, the fund generated $89 million in management fees for Prudential, according to fund documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To sign up new investors, PRISA executives made calls on places such as Springfield, a city of about 150,000. In 2007, at a fire station community room known locally as an affordable venue for birthday parties, the Prudential managers handed out a brochure saying they would aim to put more vacant space on the market, allowing them to "increase income as the economy strengthens and market rents rise." The brochure said PRISA consistently outperformed the overall commercial-real-estate market, with a return of 19% in the year that ended Sept. 30, 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Springfield fund's board members in attendance -- one policeman, two firemen, one retired fireman, three citizens and two City Hall officials -- were generally impressed, meeting minutes show. Ron Hoffman, the retiree, noted Prudential's decades of experience: "The more history you have, the smarter you are going to be," he said, according to the minutes. By a vote of 6-2, with one not voting, the board chose to invest its entire real-estate allocation -- $12 million -- with Prudential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The long-underfunded pension fund was under pressure to boost returns at the time, Ms. Honea says. To avoid asking taxpayers for a greater contribution, actuaries were telling City Hall it had to boost the annual rate of return on the fund's investments to 7.5% from about 5% to meet future obligations to retirees. Real estate seemed to be an answer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With bigger pools of money from clients seeking to invest, Prudential needed bigger deals. To do this, the insurer stuck with a partner it knew well: Mr. Pozycki, whose development firm, SJP Properties, had been doing deals with Prudential since 1996. Most of those were suburban office buildings. But in 2005, Prudential said it was interested in a Manhattan office tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon, Mr. Pozycki approached Howard Milstein, a New York billionaire whose family controlled Emigrant Savings Bank -- and the last open plot of land in Times Square. The Milsteins had owned the site on 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue since 1983, when they bought it for $5 million and planned to develop it. They had broken ground for a 35-story tower on the site in 2002, but never built anything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a meeting in his Madison Avenue office, Mr. Milstein said he was willing to consider Mr. Pozycki's offer for the site, but required a $50 million nonrefundable deposit, according to Mr. Pozycki. Mr. Pozycki and Prudential came up with the money. In May 2006, the $332 million deal was done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pozycki would get the recognition of developing a New York skyscraper -- and developers' fees -- in exchange for putting up 4% of the equity in the project, roughly $15 million, according to a December credit report on PRISA by the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> rating agency. Mr. Pozycki confirms the $15 million number, but says his exposure in the deal is bigger than that because he guarantees the building's budget, among other things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Success depended on the continued strength of the Manhattan real-estate market, which at the time was on a tear. Between 2004 and 2007, Manhattan rents rose 36% to $56.33 a square foot, according to research firm Reis. Prudential and Mr. Pozycki banked on this continuing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The attractiveness of the investment had to do with what at the time was a very tight and quickly improving office-rental market in Midtown," Mr. Smith, the PRISA portfolio manager, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as the building's sloping facade rose into the Midtown skyline, the market reversed. Reis now predicts that rents in the neighborhood of 11 Times Square will fall to about $64 a square foot by the end of this year, from a high of $76 in early 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Struggling banks and other companies have put huge blocks of space on the market in Manhattan's most desirable neighborhoods, to the east of Times Square or closer to Central Park. Mr. Pozycki's building is a block west of the center of Times Square, across the street from the city's huge Port Authority Bus Terminal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eleven Times Square hasn't landed a tenant yet. Mr. Pozycki's broker, Stephen Siegel of commercial brokerage <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group Inc</span>., says there's a 60% to 70% chance the building will have at least one tenant by the time it's finished around the end of this year. "Luck has a lot to do with it," he says. SJP and PRISA executives say they're optimistic the development will be successful and say that as one of Manhattan's few speculative office buildings, it will be well positioned if the economy bounces back soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, Prudential has written down the value of 11 Times Square to 20% less than the building's cost, fund documents show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Springfield, meanwhile, the pension fund's market value was down to $91 million at the end of March, from $131 million a year before. Nearly 10% of that was tied up with PRISA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund's board in December applied to withdraw $5 million, but it may not get the money for years because of PRISA's freeze on redemption requests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A referendum in Springfield for a sales-tax increase to keep the pension fund afloat failed in February, forcing cuts in the city budget. A proposed budget would reduce how often park lawns are mowed and roads are maintained. It would eliminate the city's summer concert series, its multifamily-housing inspections and a service to trap skunks and feral cats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hoffman, the retired fireman, says when PRISA managers visited Springfield about a month ago, they "didn't try to paint some kind of rosy picture." He says, "We were pretty comfortable with them, as comfortable as we could have been with any commercial real estate right now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No one -- again, no one -- could have anticipated what happened in the economy as quickly as it happened," said Mr. Siegel, Mr. Pozycki's broker. "That's where the expression caveat emptor came from -- let the buyer beware."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another sign that the housing market may have begun to recover, the number of people who signed contracts to purchase homes increased for the third month in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said its index of pending-home sales rose 6.7% in April to 90.3 from 84.6 in March. Increases in contract signings typically lead to more sales a month or two later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relationship between the two has been less steady since the fall, as more would-be home buyers have struggled to get financing. But the increase in signings is large enough to augur more home purchases, said Joshua Shapiro, an economist with MFR. "Clearly, within the next couple of months there's going to be a decent increase in actual home sales," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the April increase came from the Northeast, where contract signings rose 32.6%. Signings rose 9.8% in the Midwest and 1.8% in the West; they slipped 0.2% in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year over year, the index was up 3.2%. The 6.7% monthly increase was much larger than the 0.5% gain analysts had projected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the Realtors said sales of previously owned homes rose in April, with sales of foreclosed and other distressed properties accounting for nearly half of the total. The Commerce Department said sales of new homes also edged higher in April.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Continued improvement in investor sentiment aided small-capitalization stocks Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As small-caps shares -- generally defined as stocks valued at less than $2 billion -- are more tied to the ebb and flow of the domestic economy, they are more apt to be punished by negative economic news. Conversely, positive market data will generally help fuel a rally. "The market keeps getting juiced by one set of positive data after another. On Tuesday it was pending home sales," said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist, <span class="companylink">Wells Capital Management</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said pending sales of existing homes in April rose 6.7% -- the biggest monthly jump in eight years. The data along with some better-than-expected news from other economic reports such as strong May U.S. manufacturing data may show the housing market and the broader economy are stabilizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks closed Tuesday up 1.02%, or 5.30 points, to 526.63, up 5.4% on the year and the highest close since Nov. 4, 2008.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer-products company WD-40 was also a leader, tacking on 2.76, or 10%, to 30.28.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In health care, <span class="companylink">Neogen</span>, a maker of food and animal safety products, gained 1.58, or 7.2%, to 23.69 as one of its units signed a partnership agreement with the Chinese government.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In earnings news, <span class="companylink">Lions Gate Entertainment</span> (NYSE) fell 84 cents, or 13%, to 5.42, as the Santa Monica, Calif., entertainment company's fiscal-year loss widened as it recorded disappointing box-office results for releases in the fiscal second and third quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maker of large-screen video displays Daktronics shed 1.20, or 13%, to 8.02, as the Brookings, S.D., company posted a 94% decline in fiscal fourth-quarter profit.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Crude futures were little changed Tuesday, as a rally built on the prospect of an economic recovery later this year sputtered on the weak state of current oil demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Light, sweet crude for July delivery settled 3 cents lower at $68.55 a barrel on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>. The slight decline snapped a streak of six consecutive gains. July Brent crude on the ICE futures exchange settled 20 cents, or 0.3%, higher at $68.17 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Futures are approaching the psychologically important $70 a barrel, a price many analysts have predicted would only be hit once the U.S. economy began to pull out of recession, and even then not until the end of the year. Saudi Arabia's oil minister also predicted last week that prices could hit $75 a barrel this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although oil prices have doubled since February, long, unbroken moves higher have been rare, as futures have risen despite plentiful supplies and only intermittent evidence that a recovery is in progress. On Tuesday, oil prices had traded as low as $67.50 a barrel before an increase in an index measuring pending home sales helped prop up the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors believing in a quick end to the downturn have also sold out of safe havens such as the dollar and into riskier bets, including oil and equities. The euro recently traded at $1.4319, about 1.1% stronger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's just so much supply out there that crude prices should be a lot lower," said Zachary Oxman, managing director of TrendMax Futures in Encinitas, Calif. "In that case, you've got to look at other things that matter, stocks and inflation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With oil prices at a crossroads, Wednesday's release of U.S. crude and fuel inventory data is likely to help determine the market's next direction. Oil inventories have fallen in each of the previous three reports from the Energy Information Administration but remain close to an 18-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gasoline stockpiles, meanwhile, have fallen below average, just as the peak summer demand season is beginning. Analysts believe refiners are in the process of increasing fuel production, which is adding to oil demand in the short run but may also quickly lead to a deluge of gasoline if fewer Americans take driving vacations due to the weak economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Refiners "are turning the spigots back on, and that's when we're going to see a moderation in prices," said Mark Waggoner, president of Excel Futures in Newport Beach, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts expect oil inventories to drop by 1.7 million barrels in the week ended May 29, according to a Dow Jones Newswires survey. Gasoline inventories are seen rising 300,000 barrels, while distillate stocks, including heating oil and diesel, are expected to increase by 900,000 barrels. Refinery utilization is forecasted to rise 0.5 percentage point to 85.6% of capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Front-month July reformulated gasoline blendstock, or RBOB, settled 9 points, or 0.1%, higher at $1.9252 a gallon. July heating oil settled 2.14 cents, or 1.2%, higher at $1.7979 a gallon.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing industry</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">expands in Singapore</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SINGAPORE -- Manufacturing industry in Singapore expanded in May, following eight consecutive months of contractions in the city-state, due to an increase in new orders and electronics output, data issued Tuesday showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Singapore Institute of Purchasing and Materials Management said its purchasing managers' index -- a leading indicator for the manufacturing sector -- rose 2 points from a month earlier, to 51.2 in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in manufacturing activity, while a reading below 50 indicates a contraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The electronics sector chalked up a reading of 52.9 points -- 1.3 points higher than in April -- indicating an expansion for the second consecutive month. The index for new orders for May rose 2.3 points in the month to 51.7 points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australia's central bank</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">leaves key rate unchanged</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SYDNEY -- The <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of Australia</span> left its cash rate target unchanged at a 49-year low of 3%, but it clearly signaled that more rate cuts are likely if the economy stumbles in coming quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With significant stimulus measures already flowing through the economy, the central bank has time to assess evolving economic conditions, but it remains ready to cut rates again, especially as inflation falls, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision, which had been expected, comes as some signs of life return to the domestic and global economy, following sharp contractions in the quarters ended December and March, said Governor Glenn Stevens in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-quarter economic-growth data are to be released Wednesday, which may show Australia has so far sidestepped a technical recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Index suggests home sales</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">in U.S. will continue to rise</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. home sales will likely keep rising, a report suggested Tuesday, as buyers seize on property made cheaper by foreclosures, low interest rates and a tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' index for pending sales of previously owned homes increased for a third month in a row, rising 6.7% in April to 90.3 from 84.6 in March, the industry group said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index was 3.2% above the level of 87.5 in April 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index is based on signed contracts for previously owned homes and serves as a forecasting tool for the used-housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 6.7% monthly increase was much larger than the 0.5% gain analysts had projected.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The income of Americans unexpectedly surged in April, elevated by the economic-stimulus package, while spending declined and the level of savings increased to the highest in 50 years of records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal income rose at a seasonally adjusted rate of 0.5% compared with the month before, the Commerce Department said Monday. Income fell a revised 0.2% in March; originally, income was seen down 0.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal consumption in April fell 0.1% compared with the month before. Spending decreased a revised 0.3% in March; originally, spending was seen falling 0.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a 0.2% decrease in personal income during April and a 0.1% drop in consumer spending. Disposable personal income -- income after taxes -- jumped 1.1% in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stimulus plan, signed by President Barack Obama in February, provided an extra payment for the unemployed and included tax credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income was 5.7% in April, the Commerce Department said. It was 4.5% in March and 4.1% in February. The 5.7% rate was the highest since 5.9% in February 1995; the personal savings level of $620.2 billion was the largest since records began in January 1959.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a year ago, the saving rate started running higher, with the economy in recession and layoffs mounting. The Bush administration had passed its own stimulus package, and people put those payments into savings. Since the recession started in December 2007, 5.7 million jobs in the U.S. have vanished, including 539,000 during April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, U.S. construction spending made an unexpected jump in April, with a rare climb in residential outlays and an increase in commercial construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total spending rose 0.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $968.67 billion compared with the prior month, the Commerce Department said Monday. Spending increased 0.4% in March; originally, March spending was seen 0.3% higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street had expected April construction spending would sink by 0.9%. Spending was down 10.7% since April 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. manufacturing sector, meanwhile, contracted at a slower pace in May, helped by growth in new orders, according to data released Monday by the Institute for Supply Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM's manufacturing index rose to 42.8 last month from 40.1 in April. May's reading was above the 41.5 reading expected by forecasters surveyed by Dow Jones. Readings under 50 indicate contracting activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While employment and inventories continue to decline at a rapid rate and the sector continued to contract during the month, there are signs of improvement," said Norbert Ore, who directs the survey for the ISM, with May the first month of growth in the new-orders index since November 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new-orders index increased to 51.1 from 47.2 in April. New orders are considered a leading indicator, and the index has risen rapidly after bottoming at 23.1 in December 2008.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gazumping, sealed bids and escalating demand for houses -- has the U.K. housing slump been consigned to history?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A raft of recent surveys, among them the latest data from Hometrack and Nationwide, suggest house prices rose in May and estate agents report that confident buyers are resorting to the worst practices of the boom. But the exuberance looks overdone -- more likely, house prices will soon resume their downward trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices have fallen around 20% since their peak in summer 2007, and even with the small monthly rise, prices in May were down 11.3% on the year. Meanwhile, housing market activity has plunged, making the monthly figures much more volatile. Mortgage approvals are well below the 15 year average and gross mortgage lending in April was down 60% year-on-year, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Granted, affordability has improved. The house price to earnings ratio is now at its lowest level for six years at 4.3 compared to a long-term average of four. But first time buyers, crucial to get the housing market moving again, are still struggling to raise finance. The average loan-to-value ratio on mortgages available to first time buyers has fallen to 75% from 89% a year ago, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders. Meanwhile, gilt yields are rising, so mortgage rates may soon start to rise again too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a more pessimistic outlook on U.K. housing, consider the residential mortgage backed securities market where prime delinquencies have doubled in the last 12 months, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span>. The stagnant market and tighter lending criteria are making it more difficult for borrowers at risk of arrears to sell or to refinance their properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ratings agency is forecasting a peak to trough fall in the housing market of 40%. With lending still tight and unemployment continuing to rise, that looks realistic.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Why Your Mortgage Won't Make You Rich; Even when your home rises in value, the costs of borrowing often chew up those gains.</span>
</div><div class="author">By Brett Arends   </div><div>797 words</div><div>29 May 2009</div><div>23:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does a mortgage make your home a better investment? Of course it can. But it's not as simple as many people think.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After my recent column about anemic real estate returns[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124336746233955539.html] lots of readers wrote to ask whether the use of leverage -- in other words, a mortgage -- makes a difference to their investment in a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From my correspondence it seems some are engaging in oversimplified mental accounting. In making the investment case for real estate, some ignored the opportunity cost of their initial down payment. If you weren't buying a home, you could invest the money elsewhere. Others ignored the annual interest cost on their mortgage, as if the debt were free. But you've got to factor both of those into the equation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, as we've probably learned by now, debt isn't magic. You can't borrow at 7%, invest at 5% and expect to make yourself rich thanks to "leverage." Anyone who thinks that way missed their true calling -- working for <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(There may be a job for you at the Treasury, though.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To bring us up to date: From 1994 through 2009, according to the Case-Shiller index, U.S. home prices produced an annualized return of 4.7% a year. The picture since 1987 has been even less appealing. Homes have only gained about 4.1% a year since then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both rates of return are far below typical mortgage rates throughout that period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days mortgage rates look pretty cheap at around 5%. That certainly makes leverage look more enticing. If we see inflation, borrowing at 5% to buy a discounted home may turn out to be a smart move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax Benefits</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax breaks on home ownership are useful, but in many cases overstated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To write off mortgage interest, you must itemize deductions. And that means forgoing the standard deduction that everybody gets, whether they rent, own, or live in a box.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a couple filing jointly, the standard deduction is $10,900. That's about the same as the interest and property taxes on a $220,000 home (Assuming a 20% down payment, a mortgage at 5%, and 1% property taxes). So your tax breaks on home ownership are only valuable if the value of your home is above that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're single, the picture is better because your standard deduction is just $5,450. The tax breaks on home ownership start to kick in on homes over maybe $110,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story doesn't end there. The calculations also depend on what other itemized deductions you take, your state and local taxes, as well as your tax bracket, your property taxes and so on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low mortgage rates mean these breaks are actually worth less in comparative terms. You'll be paying less in interest and, thus, will have less to deduct from your taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Factors</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other issues with owning a home that complicate things financially. Buying takes time and can cost a lot of money and aggravation. And when it comes time to sell, commissions can take a real chunk out of your returns -- normally about 6% of the sale price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology even suggests home owners may end up earning less over the course of their lives than renters do. The reason? Renters can more easily move for good jobs. It may sound fanciful, but it's not completely ridiculous. Just ask someone who owns a home in Detroit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not arguing that buying a home is a bad financial move. My wife and I own. But we bought after running the numbers and comparing the annual costs with renting. We didn't gamble on big capital appreciation to help us out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor am I denying the other benfits of ownership. Owning your own place can be a great feeling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if you are trying to decide whether to rent or to buy, and you take a purely financial point of view, it's risky to rely on brisk home-price appreciation to swing the argument.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real benefits of home ownership are any capital appreciation, plus the imputed rent, minus the effective cost of the mortgage and property taxes, other costs, and the return you could earn on your down payment elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a complex figure, and it varies widely. But if your home's appreciation is lower than the annual cost of borrowing, as it has been for many over the last 20 years, leverage is not much of a friend.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. orders for big-ticket items jumped in April, offering more evidence that the manufacturing slump has abated. But a sharp downward revision to the March figures damped hopes that manufacturers are on the edge of recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods -- long-lasting items that include everything from machine tools to treadmills -- rose 1.9% last month to a seasonally adjusted $161.45 billion. Much of the gain was driven by a 5.4% rise in orders for transportation equipment. Overall orders fell 2.1% in March, a steeper decline than the initially reported 0.8% drop. Even so, the decrease in orders that began in the fall appears to have ended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've bounced around this low point for a couple of months now," said Nomura Securities economist David Resler. "If you look at the level of orders, it's starting to look like a bottom."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for capital goods excluding defense items and aircraft, which economists use as a proxy for business spending on new equipment, fell 1.5%. But the first increase in orders for metals and metal products in nine months suggested that manufacturers have run down their inventories of raw materials to the point where they need to buy more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the U.S. Labor Department reported that the number of workers filing new unemployment claims fell 13,000 to 623,000 in the week ended May 23. Much of the jump in claims that came earlier this month, as workers furloughed by the <span class="companylink">Chrysler LLC</span> bankruptcy filing signed up for unemployment benefits, has reversed itself. But with bankruptcy looking likely for <span class="companylink">General Motors Corp</span>., claims filings could jump again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week average, used to smooth the volatile initial-jobless-claims figures, fell 3,000 to 626,750. But the total number of workers filing for claims hit a new high of 6.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, sales of new single-family homes rose 0.3% last month to a 352,000 annual rate, the Commerce Department said. But sales in March fell 3%, more than the initially reported 0.6% decline. Sales rose 10% in February.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- California's median price for existing homes rose 1.4% in April from March, marking the second consecutive monthly increase in housing prices and prompting some industry officials to declare that the state's long swoon in housing values could be at or near the bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California's housing market is being closely watched as a barometer of the economy -- it is the nation's largest. Prices soared during the boom, but the collapse of housing prices has pummeled homeowners and helped send foreclosures skyrocketing. Any sign of recovery would be taken as a sign that the market is bottoming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the first back-to-back increase in the state's housing prices in two years, following an increase in the median price of homes in March from February. The median price of $256,700 for single-family homes in April is up from a median price of $253,040 in March, according to estimates by the California Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The April prices were still off 36.5% from the same month a year ago, but the sales of 540,360 homes on a seasonally adjusted, annualized basis represented a 49.2% rise over the same time, the Realtors group reported Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">April also marked the eighth consecutive month of single-family-home sales above 500,000 units. The inventory of unsold homes continued to shrink, to 4.6 months' supply from 9.8 months a year ago. "It appears that the median price is now at or near the bottom," said Leslie Appleton-Young, chief economist for the Realtors' association, who has previously made more subdued comments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But no one is pronouncing any imminent turnaround in either the national or California markets. Housing continues to be weighed down by factors including high unemployment, high foreclosures and continued economic uncertainty. While California's home market appears near the bottom of a long slide, prices could continue to fluctuate for the rest of the year, some analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At best, some markets have at least temporarily leveled off in price," said Andrew LePage, analyst at MDA Dataquick Information Services, a market-research firm in La Jolla, Calif. "I don't see any markets that have clearly bottomed out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, the best-performing markets across the state in terms of sales volume were in lower-priced, inland areas that had seen some of the steepest declines in prices. Sales in the high-desert region outside Los Angeles, for example, more than doubled in April from the same month a year ago, after price declines of 49.5% over the same time. Median prices, even month to month, continued to fall there amid a glut of foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in several more densely populated areas, the median price was stronger. Los Angeles County's median rose 1.9% in April from March, after falling 31% over the past year. In Silicon Valley's Santa Clara County, the median price rose 3.6% after a year-over-year fall of 38.2%, the Realtor's group said. Boosting sales are some of the best affordability rates in almost a decade, say economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors' officials said sales remain weaker for more-expensive homes. Inventories of unsold homes in the under-$500,000 segment, for example, shrank to nearly three months' supply in April from about 10 months a year ago. But the inventory of homes priced at more than $1 million rose to about 17 months from 10 months a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem for the higher end of the market is that lending has tightened greatly for the jumbo mortgages that are often needed to buy a home costing more than $500,000, say economists. Some lenders now require down payments of as much as 30% to 40%. As a result, sales have remained anemic in pricey markets like San Francisco.</p>
