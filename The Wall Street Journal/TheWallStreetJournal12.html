<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's some intelligence for Americans who think of Guam only as a military outpost. The U.S. territory in the Western Pacific offers white-sand beaches and ocean vistas—at far lower prices than its closest American neighbor, Hawaii[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/honolulus-kahala-avenue-begins-a-new-chapter-1407971039].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Cielo and Roberto Martinez purchased a three-bedroom beachfront condo for $930,000 in La Stella Maris, a 12-unit building on Tumon Bay. Originally from New Orleans, the couple moved to Guam from Las Vegas nearly four years ago because “my husband always wanted to live by the ocean," says Mrs. Martinez, a 59-year-old retired honorary consul general of the Philippines in New Orleans, whose husband is a radiologist. “It's like living in a cruise ship, we're so close to the ocean. Every morning we sit on the balcony and have breakfast and sometimes we can see stingrays and dolphins."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, the real-estate market is surging on the island, which is about 30 miles long and has about 170,000 inhabitants. Tourism has increased, with travelers from Korea, Taiwan and China buying beachfront condos and other property for less than it costs to buy a one-bedroom unit in their own country. And Guam Regional Medical City, a new, private hospital that opened earlier this year, is bringing doctors and other medical professionals to the Hagåtña area, Guam's commercial district and the seat of government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also significant is the relocation of U.S. military personnel from Okinawa, Japan[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB10001424127887323874204578217490207346314], to Guam. In August, the Navy completed plans to start moving 5,000 Marines and 1,300 family members to Guam. The move is the latest in an effort designed to bolster military defenses in the western Pacific.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A lot of attention is on Guam because of the military buildup," says Beverly Alerta Brady, a local real-estate agent. “That's helping push the real-estate market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Annual sales of single-family homes priced at $500,000 or above increased 52% from January 2012 through August 2015, according to annualized data from Cornerstone Valuation Guam, a local real-estate valuation and advisory company. What's more, only six homes sold for $1 million and above from 2008 to the middle of 2014. From August 2014 to September 2015, there have been seven sales for $1 million or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The highest sale of the year so far, which closed in September, was a 2,871-square-foot home overlooking Tumon Bay on a street called Paseo de Oro, or “avenue of gold," considered one of the island's premier streets. The home, which was listed for $1.58 million, received multiple bids within several weeks and sold for $1.68 million to a local businessman and his wife, according to public records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Down the street, a four-bedroom, 2½-bath home was listed for $1.53 million in early October and already has received several offers, according to real-estate agents familiar with the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In 2013 the market was really slow, listings would just sit there," says Norma Del Carmen, an agent. “Then last year, things really started to pick up, with some places being gobbled up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, Ms. Del Carmen sold a condo in Villa Kanton Tasi, a luxury tower with only 22 units that's less than 100 feet from the sea. Pediatrician Edna Santos paid $1.25 million—the priciest condo sale so far this year—for the three-bedroom, three-bath unit, which has granite countertops, hardwood floors and a 500-square-foot wraparound balcony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Santos, a native of the Philippines who has lived on Guam since 1996, decided to downsize and sold her 6,000-square-foot home for $1.39 million in July. “I was ready for a change and tired of maintaining a house," Dr. Santos, 53, says. “Villa Kanton Tasi was on the beach in the center of Tumon with a spectacular view of the ocean."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buildings where the Martinezes and Dr. Santos have condos are some of the most sought-after oceanfront properties because current construction rules no longer allow buildings so close to the ocean. Guam's new supply of luxury homes has been limited. One of the higher-end buildings, 468 San Vitores, where the 12 units were priced between $600,000 and $1.5 million, was completed in 2014, along with the gated community of Talo Verde Estates, where cookie-cutter dwellings start at about $750,000, and cliff-side luxury homes overlooking Tumon Bay are priced in the millions. As of now, brokers say, there aren't any new high-end projects in the works. Currently, the median price for a single-family home on the island is about $210,000. In the rental market, the average monthly rent on a single-family home was $2,255, according to the Guam Multiple Listing Service. Condos rent for an average $1,617 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate market on such a tiny island can be shaky. “We have a saying that when the world sneezes, Guam catches a cold," says Siska Hutapea, owner of Cornerstone Valuation Guam. “We are very susceptible to external forces." Several new projects that were under way when the global financial crisis hit have been stalled for years and are just now starting to get back on track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no limits on U.S. citizens who purchase property in Guam. Foreigners are allowed to purchase one property, but many bypass the cap by purchasing through a limited-liability company, says Anthony Godwin, principal broker at Today's Realty. Most buyers are looking for investment properties or vacation homes. Also appealing to some homeowners is that Guam is the closest U.S. soil to Asian countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While desirable locals on Guam include the centrally located Tumon, Tamuning and Barrigada Heights, there are still poor areas, with about 20% of the population living below the poverty line. Some commercial areas are somewhat gritty, with massage parlors and bars lining the street less than a mile from Louis Vuitton, Jimmy Choo and Prada luxury stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joe Marchal, a semiretired investment banker who used to live on Guam full time, is selling his home for $6.5 million now that his family lives in Las Vegas. The 8,100-square-foot home, which sits on the cliff-lined street in Talo Verde Estates, includes an infinity-edge pool with waterfalls, a music room, Japanese soaking tubs and a dine-in wine cellar. On the market since 2013, the house has had some offers, but nothing that satisfied him. “I'd like to get my money back," Mr. Marchal says, adding it cost more than $5 million over three years to build.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is currently the highest single-family home listing—an outlier, since only nine single-family homes are for sale above $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of Guam's housing market started to take shape in the 1970s, about 30 years after the U.S. recaptured the island from Japanese forces in 1944. (The U.S. first claimed Guam as its own territory in 1898, following the Spanish-American War.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rita and Jay Miller, originally from the U.S., have lived in their luxury beachfront condo for the past 10 years. They purchased the home, which has solid teak floors, granite countertops and high-end kitchen appliances, for $1.1 million. Today the couple—he's an electrical engineer and she's a retired corporate executive—estimate it's worth about $1.7 million, based on a sale for the same price in the building last year. While the couple say they have no plans to sell, they aren't immune to a good deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If someone offered us $2 million, we'd probably take it," Mrs. Miller says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a slowing Hamptons market[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/east-end-aside-home-sales-up-on-long-island-1445561105], a century-old Water Mill home has sold for $27 million—30% less than its original asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate of the late hedge-fund pioneer Jack Nash originally went on the market in June of 2014[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/hamptons-estate-of-jack-nash-to-list-for-38-5-million-1403826389]for $38.5 million and saw s-everal price cuts. The roughly 6-acre property was last listed at $28 million, and the sale closed in late October, said co-listing agents Harald Grant of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> and Tim Davis of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. They declined to identify the buyer, but said there were multiple bidders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was surprised it took this long to sell," Mr. Grant said. “But you can't always predict the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built in the early 1900s, the shingle-style house had been in the Nash family for more than 30 years. With roughly 500 feet of frontage on Mecox Bay, the property has a six-bedroom main house with staff quarters and a guesthouse. The grounds include a swimming pool, a tennis court and a dock. A four-story water tower, original to the property, contains a bathroom and kitchenette.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property was challenging to price because it needed updating, Mr. Davis said. “This was an older home," Mr. Grant added. “It had a lot of charm, but with the charm comes additional work."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in the <span class="companylink">Hamptons</span> have slowed over the past year. According to a quarterly market report from <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span> there were 507 closed sales in the third quarter, down 20% from 634 in the same period last year. At the high-end, the average sales price of a home in the top 10% of the <span class="companylink">Hamptons</span> market fell 15.1% to $7.14 million in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Davis attributed the decline to a shortage of available trophy properties after several busy years. Mr. Grant said many European and South American buyers are staying away due to currency issues, a factor that could be affecting demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nash was chairman of the investment firm <span class="companylink">Oppenheimer &amp; Co</span>. before co-founding the hedge fund and private-equity firm Odyssey Partners in 1982.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a new development of three spec homes in the tony Los Angeles neighborhood of Bel Air, one property will have a 15,000-square-foot guesthouse. Another home has plans that call for a "Champagne room," a chilled, glass rotunda with walls filled with bubbling liquid. A third home will have a 2,100-square-foot spa with separate steam and massage rooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only thing missing: a crowd of buyers who can afford to live in them. The Park Bel Air, the 11-acre development currently under construction, has asking prices that start at $115 million -- and go up to $150 million with upgrades and custom furnishings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are probably only about 3,000 people [in the world] who can afford this," says Barry Watts, the Los Angeles-based president of Domvs London, the Park Bel Air's developer. The buyer "needs to be a billionaire."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Angeles, the latest trophy homes -- many of them speculatively built -- may top the $100 million mark. Sales at eye-popping prices have been fueled partly by wealthy international buyers who traditionally shopped for second homes in places like New York, London or Monaco, but have lately turned their sights on Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently there are more than four dozen homes on the market in the L.A. area priced above $20 million, and the priciest trophy homes seek over $50 million. The most ambitious of the projects: A spec home under construction in Bel Air will hit the market when it's completed next year with an unprecedented asking price of $500 million, according to its developer, Nile Niami.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, while demand in L.A. remains strong, real-estate experts note that ultrahigh asking prices are seldom the sale prices. Instead, stratospheric pricing is often more of a marketing ploy than an attempt to place a real value on a home, says Jonathan Miller, head of New York-based appraisal firm Miller Samuel. "It's almost as if there is no shame in wildly overpricing a listing anymore," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Shapiro, chairman of Westside Estate Agency and the listing agent for the homes in the Park Bel Air, says the location and size of the properties justify the prices. The homes will range from 58,000 square feet to 66,000 square feet and are on unusually large lots in the flat section of Bel Air, but have views more typically found in hillside homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer than 10 U.S. homes have ever sold for $100 million or more, according to Mr. Miller, including just three in the state of California. The priciest was the 2012 sale of a $117 million property in Woodside to Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son, according to the <span class="companylink">Los Angeles Times</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Niami's $500 million home sells at even a 50% discount, it would top what is thought to be the most-expensive home sale: $221 million paid in 2011 by Ukrainian billionaire Rinat Akhmetov for a penthouse in London's One Hyde Park condominium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Angeles, the highest known price paid for a private home is $102 million for Fleur de Lys, a 41,000-square-foot furnished mansion modeled after a French chateau that sold earlier this year. The home had been on the market with an asking price of $125 million since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To set the latest slate of trophy homes apart, developers are loading them up with every imaginable amenity. Designs for homes in the Park Bel Air call for <span class="companylink">IMAX</span> movie theaters and master suites as large as 8,000 square feet with closets that include catwalks and built-in cameras for viewing outfits from multiple angles. Two of the homes will have race-car simulators. Gavin Brodin, who oversaw the renovation of the $85 million, 57,000-square-foot Spelling Manor, one of the priciest and largest homes ever sold in a Los Angeles, is handling the design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Habibi, a professor at UCLA's Ziman Center for Real Estate, says many high-end builders take a counterintuitive approach: The pricier the spec home, the more specialized, one-of-a-kind amenities. Developers hope that unique features will prompt one buyer to shell out big bucks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's uncharacteristic for how you usually sell," he says, which is to design a home that would broadly appeal to buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Niami's spec home will include 100,000 square feet of space across a 4-acre property. Four separate swimming pools, parking for more than 30 cars, a four-lane bowling alley and an 8,000-square-foot nightclub with a VIP room and casino are also planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home will include nine bedrooms, and the 5,500-square-foot master suite could function "more like a private apartment" for the homeowners, says architect Paul McClean. Eight additional bedrooms and living quarters for staff will be located in a completely separate structure underneath the home's main driveway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Niami purchased the hilltop lot three years ago for about $30 million, according to public records. He says he wasn't initially planning to build something so large, but that it evolved during the design process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some residents say the scale of the latest developments has gone too far, with construction timelines that can stretch into years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fred Rosen, the former chief executive of Ticketmaster, co-founded the Bel Air Homeowner's Alliance last year to voice community concerns over massive construction projects. He says that the home Mr. Niami is building involved the removal of tens of thousands of cubic yards of dirt, which brought an endless stream of large trucks that choked traffic for weeks. Recently, the city set limits on the amount of soil that can be excavated for underground living spaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosen says he doesn't necessarily begrudge the size of the new homes being built -- after all, this is Bel Air, where the average sale price last year was $5.2 million. He does, however, question the logic of some of the home designs. "When you think of it, who in their right mind needs four swimming pools?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Why would you not need four swimming pools?" says Mr. Niami, who says the number makes sense for a property of this size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joe Horacek, an entertainment lawyer, lives in Bel Air below a 30,000-square-foot home under construction by Mohamed Hadid, an ultraluxury spec-home developer who says he plans to list the home for $200 million. Mr. Horacek says Mr. Hadid was not approved to build a home of that size on the hillside lot. Prompted by complaints by Mr. Horacek and other neighbors, the city has halted construction because the home exceeds the size it was permitted for and has unpermitted retaining walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hadid says he is working to comply with the city's order, and that he plans to resume construction as soon as he is approved to do so. A representative from the city attorney's says the city is pursuing a misdemeanor criminal complaint against the limited liability company that owns the property. Mr. Hadid says he is developing the property but is not the owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosen and other neighbors are also concerned with the risk that the massive spec homes will sit on the market unoccupied for years or never sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is that possibility of abandoned white elephants," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers say they are confident there are buyers for their properties. Mr. Niami says that about 20 potential buyers have expressed interest in the home. He predicts his buyer will likely come from the Middle East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think whoever is buying this house is going to have 10 other houses," he says. "Nobody buys a 100,000-square-foot house as their principal residence to use every day."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—The number of previously owned homes that went under contract across the U.S. fell last month, a sign of choppiness in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales—which measure purchases before they become final—declined 2.3% to a seasonally adjusted reading of 106.8 in September, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday. That marked the second-lowest level of the year and the second consecutive monthly drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had predicted a 1% rise in September sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR, an industry group, attributed the latest decline to a shortage of home listings that have limited options for buyers, particularly at the lower end of the market, as well as recent stock-market volatility that may have rattled prospective buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The rockiness in the financial markets at the end of the summer and signs of a slowing U.S. economy may be causing some prospective buyers to take a wait-and-see approach," said Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the latest softness, the housing market overall is strengthening on the back of low interest rates, a steadily expanding labor market and improved household finances. Pending sales were up 3% in September compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales are a bellwether of the housing market since they measure transactions early in weekslong homebuying process. But because many contracts never reach “closing," the gauge isn't as closely followed as the NAR's existing-home sales report that reflects final purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales—reflecting about 90% of all purchases—climbed 4.7% last month from August[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-sales-of-existing-homes-surge-in-september-1445522932], coming close to a postrecession high, the NAR said last week. Sales are on pace for their best year since before the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, intermittent signs are surfacing of a slowdown this fall in the new-home market. On Monday, data released by the Commerce Department showed that the pace of new-home sales in September marked an 11.5% decline from August and a tepid year-over-year gain of 2%[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-fall-11-5-in-september-1445868162].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>., a builder operating in nine states, posted a 4% gain in third quarter orders for new homes in comparison with the year-earlier figure, well short of analysts' expectations. Meritage's sales deteriorated throughout the quarter, from a 22% gain in July and an 8% gain in August to a 12% decline in September. Meritage Chief Executive Steve Hilton said the builder expects that its October sales will produce a gain of 10% to 15%, but he added that the September decline was enough to hamper Meritage's results for the fiscal year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We expected a much bigger month in September," Mr. Hilton said on a conference call with investors to discuss the results. “I think our results in September were consistent with what other builders saw in that time period. I'm not sure if it was stock market volatility or what it was that caused buyers to pull back in that month, but it was very disappointing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, other builders have posted mixed results for the third quarter. <span class="companylink">MDC Holdings Inc</span>., the parent of <span class="companylink">Richmond American Homes</span>, posted a 3% gain in orders well below analysts' expectations. <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>. registered a healthy 8% gain. But McGuyer Home Builders Inc., a closely held Texas builder, said its smaller-than-expected 4% gain in September orders occurred despite a strong flow of would-be buyers through its model homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's taking buyers longer to make a decision," McGuyer President Gary Tesch said. “There is obviously competition, more storefronts available in our Texas markets. But I think there's just enough negative static out there in the media that people just aren't jumping out to buy right now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some factors affect the new-home market the same way as they do with existing homes. For example, buyers of either type of home might be influenced by recent reports of a slowing U.S. economy[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-economic-growth-cools-in-third-quarter-1446122018] and dented corporate profits[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-companies-warn-of-slowing-economy-1445818298]. And a slowdown in Houston's busy housing market because of depressed oil prices stands to affect national results for both new homes and resales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders, however, face the additional obstacles of construction delays because of labor shortages and unusually wet weather earlier this year. Builders including Meritage, <span class="companylink">MDC</span> and Pulte have acknowledged challenges in finishing construction of homes sold last spring and summer by year-end so they can book that revenue and profit this year. In turn, those builders now faced with a growing backlog of homes sold but not yet completed likely are reluctant to add to that burden by selling additional homes they can't even start building for many weeks or months.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years into the housing market recovery, New Jersey-based builder Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. is taking another turn for the worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The eighth-largest U.S. home builder faces $467 million in debt coming due through 2017 -- and has no easy answers for how to repay it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hovnanian's share price has declined by 44% in the past year, the second steepest drop among 22 publicly traded U.S. home builders behind only that of small California builder UCP Inc. Hovnanian's market value, which peaked at $4.5 billion in 2005, now languishes at $317 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hovnanian's plight shows the shadow cast by the housing crisis, which cut the ranks of U.S. home builders in half between 2007 and 2012 and left the survivors chastened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the largest builders used their heft to rebound. A number of small and midsize builders failed, got gobbled up by larger acquirers or, like <span class="companylink">William Lyon Homes</span> and <span class="companylink">WCI Communities Inc</span>., shed their debt in bankruptcy court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are the unusual cases of a few builders, led by Hovnanian, that skirted bankruptcy during the downturn only to be dogged by debt for years afterward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts and investors are eyeing Hovnanian's next big debt payment -- $173 million of bonds due Jan. 15 -- to see whether the builder can refinance or face the less-palatable options of dipping into its cash or selling land to partners to retire the bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hovnanian Chief Executive Ara Hovnanian said in an interview that the Red Bank, N.J., company will be profitable in its fiscal quarter ending Oct. 31, excluding taxes and charges. In Hovnanian's previous quarter, which ended July 31, the builder posted a loss of $7.7 million -- its 13th net loss in the past 20 quarters -- and a 4.8% decline in homes delivered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a Sept. 9 conference call with investors to discuss Hovnanian's quarterly results, the builder's executives took the unusual step of outlining how the builder can sell or mortgage land or sell and lease back its model homes to raise additional cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've outlined in reasonable detail how, with no improvement in the current market conditions, we can dramatically improve our balance sheet over time," Mr. Hovnanian said in an interview. "We can do it just based on our performance."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hovnanian's struggles can be attributed almost entirely to its own missteps, rather than to any weakness in the overall new-home market. Hovnanian, with an average sales price of $375,215 in its latest quarter, caters almost equally to buyers in the first-time, move-up and luxury segments. While total U.S. new-home sales are up 17.6% so far this year from last year, the greatest volume gains in that span came in the middle tiers of homes priced from $200,000 to $500,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hovnanian, like many big real-estate companies, is a decades-old venture run by its founding family's second generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevork Hovnanian, an ethnic Armenian who grew up in Iraq, fled political upheaval and violence in Baghdad in 1959, abandoning his road-building business to join his three brothers already in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Settling in Toms River, N.J., he started his home-building empire there from a construction trailer parked on land where he built a 20-lot subdivision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevork Hovnanian's son, Ara, joined the company in 1979 and became chief executive in 1997. The <span class="companylink">University of Pennsylvania Wharton School</span> graduate added the chairman role after his father died in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ara Hovnanian, 58 years old, led the company through one of the industry's biggest acquisition sprees from 1999 to 2006, continuing even as the housing crash began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hovnanian's 19 deals to buy small builders and land portfolios in that span greatly contributed to the builder's $2.1 billion debt load, which now costs it $35 million to $40 million per quarter in interest alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making those deals at peak prices haunted Hovnanian as property values rapidly fell. Since 2006, the builder has written off more than $2.7 billion,.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hovnanian's situation worsened this year despite the housing market's gradual recovery. The builder's 7% growth in orders for new homes in the 12-month period ended in July fell short of most of its peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hovnanian also revealed in earnings calls in March and June that an aggressive bet on speculative homes -- those built without a buyer already lined up -- had backfired. That left the builder with hundreds of homes it had to sell at a discount, hammering its already-weak profit margin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The threat of bankruptcy is increasing for Hovnanian," said Vicki Bryan, a senior analyst with bond-research firm Gimme Credit LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hovnanian responded in the interview that bankruptcy was "absolutely not" a possibility.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making those deals at peak prices haunted Hovnanian as property values rapidly fell. Since 2006, the builder has written off more than $2.7 billion, much of it from those peak-market deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Hovnanian's crushing debt and scant equity kept it from buying cheap land in the early years of the housing market's recovery of 2011 through 2013, which has since hindered its profit margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Being left with a more constrained balance sheet has affected every decision that they have made subsequently," said Nishu Sood, an analyst tracking home builders for <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hovnanian's situation worsened this year despite the housing market's gradual recovery. The builder's 7% growth in orders for new homes in the 12-month period ended in July fell short of most of its peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hovnanian also revealed in earnings calls in March and June that an aggressive bet on speculative homes—those built without a buyer already lined up—had backfired, with lackluster sales in markets such as Virginia, Maryland and New Jersey. That left the builder with hundreds of homes it had to sell at a discount, hammering its already weak profit margin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That spooked investors concerned about Hovnanian's ability to handle its debt payments. Yields on Hovnanian's bonds have increased by roughly a third since August, a sign that investors have cooled on Hovnanian. Bond yields move in the opposite direction of price. Rather than refinancing a slug of bonds that came due on Oct. 15, Hovnanian opted to use precious cash. Its Oct. 8 deal to sell land to a land banker for $125 million likely leaves it with roughly $322 million of liquidity in addition to cash generated in its current quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least one analyst is unconvinced. “The threat of bankruptcy is increasing for Hovnanian, given its threadbare liquidity versus severe cash consumption and significant debt maturities in coming months," said Vicki Bryan, a senior analyst with bond-research firm Gimme Credit LLC. “And we doubt it can borrow or land-bank its way to solvency."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hovnanian responded in the interview that bankruptcy was “absolutely not" a possibility. Larry Sorsby, Hovnanian's chief financial officer, separately reiterated the company's game plan to raise cash by selling some of its land to land bankers, mortgaging some of its land or selling and leasing back its model homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Hovnanian's bondholders agrees that the builder can survive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Any company that has a lot of debt and is in a cyclical business needs time [to] grow back into their balance sheet," said Andy Geryol, a senior analyst at Invesco Ltd., which holds more than $15 million of Hovnanian's bonds. “I think the market environment does allow that for Hovnanian."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto   </div><div>610 words</div><div>27 October 2015</div><div>16:16</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose in August, according to a report released Tuesday, suggesting the market has momentum heading into the final months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index increased 4.7% in the 12 months ended in August, slightly better than the 4.6% gain recorded in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The last three, four, five months, we've been on this very steady pace. I think that's a good sign," said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at home-tracker Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller 20-city index jumped 5.1% year-over-year through August, after July's 4.9% increase. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a 5.1% increase in the 20-city index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller 10-city index increased 4.7% from a year earlier, compared with a 4.5% increase in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">West Coast cities remained the strongest markets over the past year, with San Francisco and Denver gaining 10.7% through August, and Portland, Ore., jumping 9.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Portland showed the strongest price growth from July to August of the large U.S. cities covered by Case-Shiller, with a gain of 1.1% before seasonal adjustment. In all, 18 of 20 cities reported month-over-month price increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rebecca Walter, a real-estate agent with Redfin in Portland, said she has seen an influx of people moving to escape San Francisco's rising home prices and the Northeast's punishing winters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign of the market's strength, she said, some buyers are offering more than the asking price even when they are the only bidders. She said that might be because buyers coming from places like California and New York view Portland as a bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, she said, the market has cooled slightly. “It's a little bit calmer," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists caution that home prices, which are rising about twice as quickly as incomes, represent one of the market's biggest long-term challenges. A lack of new construction has created a supply shortage, magnifying the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People slowly but surely get priced out of the housing market," said David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the Index Committee for S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the Commerce Department released data showing the national homeownership rate remains near its lowest point in several decades. Not seasonally adjusted, the homeownership rate ticked up slightly to 63.7% from 63.4% in the last quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics, said the numbers could show that the homeownership rate, which has been declining steadily for a decade, is finally leveling out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don't expect any significant increase anytime soon, but I think we're finally at bottom," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Case-Shiller offers a delayed picture of how the housing market is faring. More recent indicators largely have been strong. Sales of previously owned homes increased sharply in September[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-sales-of-existing-homes-surge-in-september-1445522932], climbing 4.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.55 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on Monday, the Commerce Department said new-home sales tumbled[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-fall-11-5-in-september-1445868162]11.5% from August to September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Until Monday, when I saw new-home sales, the housing market looked wonderful," Mr. Blitzer said. Still, he said the overall numbers suggest “housing is having a good year."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of newly built homes fell across the country in September, suggesting a segment of the housing market could be cooling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of new single-family homes fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 468,000 in September, the Commerce Department said Monday, down 11.5% from August's downwardly revised rate of 529,000. September's pace was 2% higher than the same month a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 5.8 months' supply of newly built homes in September, the highest level since July 2014. The number of homes for sale at the end of September stood at 225,000, the most since March 2010, although most of the 9,000-home uptick was in homes that weren't yet started or still under construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders have reported labor shortages as many construction workers who lost jobs during the recession moved on to other industries or left the labor market altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edwin Woods, a division president of <span class="companylink">Dan Ryan Builders</span>, which operates in six East Coast states, said inventories are tight in his region in North Carolina because supply isn't keeping up with demand. He hasn't been able to keep speculative homes -- those that go under construction without a buyer lined up -- in stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We barely have any homes currently available that will deliver in the next 60 days," Mr. Woods said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price of new homes stood at $296,900, up from $261,500 a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of new homes fell in every region of the country in September, but the drop was most precipitous in the Northeast. The rate of home sales in that region fell by 61.8% in September from August, and is down 56.7% from September a year ago. The South and West regions are still up from September 2014, despite a downward tick last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales figures are volatile and frequently revised, with the reported figure having a margin of error of plus or minus 11.3 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite September's drop, 2015 has seen a significant improvement in the overall rate of new home sales. The year-to-date rate of new-home sales, not seasonally adjusted, is up 17.6% from the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The September report was a clear disappointment, but does little to alter our view that the housing market is continuing to recover," said Daniel Silver, an economist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span>, in a note to clients. "We view the new home sales data as unreliable and many other more reliable housing indicators have been sending upbeat signals lately."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economist Stephen Stanley at Amherst Pierpont Securities said September's fall from August was "most likely statistical noise," given the volatility of the new-home sales figures, but noted that it could reflect what was a bumpy September for financial markets.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of newly built homes declined in September, suggesting a segment of the housing market could be cooling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of new single-family homes fell to a seasonally adjusted rate of 468,000 in September, the Commerce Department said Monday, off 11.5% from August's downwardly revised rate of 529,000. The reported figure has a margin of error of plus or minus 11.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September's pace of newly built home sales was up 2% from the same month a year earlier. There were 5.8 months' worth of supply of newly built homes in September, the highest since July 2014. The number of homes for sale at the end of September stood at 225,000, the most since March 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price of new homes stood at $296,900, up from $261,500 a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales figures are volatile and frequently revised. Despite September's drop, 2015 has still seen a significant improvement in the overall rate of new-home sales. The year-to-date rate of new-home sales, not seasonally adjusted, is up 17.6% from the same period a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the housing market can continue its recovery in the face of domestic and global headwinds remains to be seen. Sales of existing homes rose 4.7% in September to the second-highest pace in eight years as continued low interest rates and pent-up demand supported the housing recovery. Existing-home sales account for about 90% of the residential real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home building rebounded in September after two straight months of declines, the Commerce Department said last week, largely because of a sharp increase in construction of apartments and other multifamily housing. And a gauge of home-builder sentiment rose to a 10-year high in October, a sign of momentum for a key sector of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But home builders have reported labor shortages, as many construction workers who lost jobs during the recession moved on to other industries or left the labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some factors remain supportive, such as a decision in September by the Federal Reserve not to raise short-term interest rates, which likely would have caused mortgage rates to rise. But wage gains have been muted over the recovery despite steady job creation over the past six years, making it harder for potential buyers to save for a down payment on a home.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar slid broadly on Monday as investors booked profits on recent gains after disappointing housing numbers[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-fall-11-5-in-september-1445868162]underscored how U.S. economic data remain uneven ahead of the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> monetary-policy meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar fell 0.3% against the euro, as the common currency bought $1.1056 in late-afternoon trade, on pace to end a three-session advance. The dollar declined 0.3% versus the yen to ¥121.04, halting a seven-day rally against the Japanese currency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a basket of commonly traded currencies, slipped 0.2% to 88.45, falling for the first time in four sessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar had strengthened over much of last week as investors grew more confident that the Fed would raise interest rates this year. At the same time, they are betting that central banks such as the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> and the <span class="companylink">Bank of Japan</span> will boost easing policies[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/boj-keeps-policy-unchanged-despite-mounting-doubts-over-2-price-target-1444193301]that have weakened their respective currencies as they continue their struggle against low growth and inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, <span class="companylink">the ECB</span>indicated it could act[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/ecb-leaves-interest-rates-unchanged-1445514521]as soon as December. Analysts predict even chances for the BOJ to augment its stimulus program at its policy meeting on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors on Monday took profits on the dollar's rise, a move that accelerated after data showed that new home sales in the U.S. fell 11.5% to a seasonally adjusted rate of 468,000 in September, the Commerce Department said. Economists had forecast 555,000 newly built homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“New home sales put a damper on things; housing has been a bright spot in the U.S. economy recently," said Brad Bechtel, managing director in Jefferies FX Group. “We might see a little unwinding of recent dollar gains going into the week."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Open Market Committee concludesa two-day meeting[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/betting-against-a-fed-rate-rise-1445790240]on Wednesday. Few investors anticipate the central bank will raise interest rates before December, but the Fed could reinforce the view that December remains possible, Mr. Bechtel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher interest rates in the U.S. would make the dollar more attractive to investors seeking yield.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto   </div><div>820 words</div><div>26 October 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Protesters of rising home prices in the San Francisco area blame the technology sector, saying the industry's high salaries and lavish stock-option awards are fueling the increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they have had little evidence to support such claims, in part because many of the cities with the highest concentrations of technology workers also have limited housing supply and tough rules governing new projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now they have some hard data to chew on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The San Francisco area is home to a concentration of tech firms, including <span class="companylink">Apple Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Google</span> parent <span class="companylink">Alphabet Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Facebook Inc</span>., all of which are based near neighborhoods with rising home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home tracker Zillow, at the request of The Wall Street Journal, homed in on employees at Apple, the world's largest tech firm, studying the neighborhoods where they live to tease out the extent to which tech workers in particular are pushing up home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings: Apple workers live in pricier homes than other residents in the region, and home values are rising much faster in neighborhoods where Apple workers live. The gap between homes that Apple employees live in and overall prices in those areas, according to Zillow, has widened since the release of the first iPhone in 2007. The iPhone has helped boost Apple's stock price and, in tandem, employee compensation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apple is likely not the only technology company to have such an effect, but the labor-intensive nature of the research made it difficult to study several firms. Zillow used census data to track down where workers in the census tract that is dominated by Apple's Cupertino, Calif., headquarters live -- primarily neighborhoods in the San Jose and San Francisco metropolitan areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings offer a cautionary tale for cities around the U.S. looking to attract more tech jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a concern that you're displacing the current population," said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tech workers can't be blamed for all of San Francisco's and San Jose's housing troubles. Zoning laws and regulatory red tape are key factors as well. Markets with high concentrations of tech workers but with readily available land and more permissive zoning regulations, such as Seattle and Austin, Texas, are seeing more modest price increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home values shot up 11% in San Jose and 14% in San Francisco in the year ending in October, according to real-estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, they increased by 10% in Austin and 9% in Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, for cities that historically have been considered affordable places for middle-class families, the change in home prices as the tech sector flourishes can be dramatic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Boulder, Colo., which enjoyed an influx of tech workers over the past five years, home values have risen nearly 38% over the period, according to <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Stone, an agent in Boulder with real-estate brokerage Redfin, said he has watched local buyers struggle to compete with tech workers coming from California who find prices a bargain and often pay in cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other sellers have decided to pocket a profit from the rise in their homes' value over the past couple of years and leave the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Francisco and San Jose, Apple employees lived in homes with a median value of $1.1 million as of July. In comparison, the median home value for the entire San Jose metro area was $896,000. In San Francisco it was $757,000, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes occupied by Apple workers are appreciating at 18% a year, compared with 11% for San Francisco as a whole and 12% for San Jose. Since iPhone sales launched in June 2007, the Zillow analysis found, the average difference between the median home value of Apple workers and San Jose workers has swelled to 20% from 13%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The region's housing problems aren't easily solved. Because homes are so expensive, many young people must rent. That has created a swell in demand for rentals. New construction has failed to keep pace. The result is that rents also have skyrocketed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011, one in seven people in the Bay Area searched the Redfin website for homes outside the Bay Area, the company said. Now it is one in four.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, the trend bodes well for longtime residents of the neighborhoods Apple employees favor. Their home values are appreciating, leaving them or their heirs with bigger profits when it comes time to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some people may be selling because the price is high and also because they think the bubble is going to burst any time because it's just insane already," said Sophie Tsang, a Cupertino-based agent at Intero Real Estate Services. "There's another group of potential sellers that think it's going to keep going up."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Former Trader</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A former <span class="companylink">Rabobank</span> trader wanted by U.S. prosecutors for his alleged role in manipulating a key interest rate has been arrested, authorities said Saturday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Thompson, an Australian citizen and former derivatives trader for Dutch bank <span class="companylink">Rabobank</span> Groep NV in Singapore, was detained Thursday following an extradition request by the U.S., a spokesperson from the <span class="companylink">Australian Attorney-General's Department</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Thompson is one of seven former <span class="companylink">Rabobank</span> employees charged in connection with the world-wide Libor manipulation scandal that has ensnared at least 18 financial institutions and 35 individuals. The interest rate underpins bank lending products worth trillions of dollars -- from mortgages to student loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Mr. Thompson is wanted to face prosecution in the United States for wire and bank fraud offenses," the spokesperson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, Mr. Thompson's wife, Robyn, said: "There is no reason for Paul to be charged by the U.S. For this reason we were hoping that Paul could defend himself against any allegations in either Australia or the U.K., so he could have access to the necessary evidence, financial and emotional support to do this properly."

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Caixabank</span> SA's third-quarter profit rose 26%, but fell short of analysts' expectations, as the Spanish bank moved more aggressively than anticipated in removing interest-rate floors on some home loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank said net profit was 288 million euros ($320 million) for the quarter, compared with 228 million euros a year earlier. Analysts had expected a result of 305 million euros, according to a poll by data provider FactSet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Caixabank</span> said net interest income -- the difference between what lenders pay clients for deposits and charge for loans -- was 1.04 billion euros, down from the 1.06 billion euros the bank reported a year earlier, and below forecasts of 1.07 billion euros.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figure was weaker than expected in large part because <span class="companylink">Caixabank</span> had removed floors on more than 94% of the roughly 200,000 mortgage contracts that had such limits, Chief Executive Officer Gonzalo Gortazar said Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Caixabank</span> and some other Spanish banks have begun eliminating interest-rate floors in mortgage contracts as they await a court decision on the legality of such limits.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Alejandro Lazo   </div><div>789 words</div><div>24 October 2015</div><div>05:30</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO—Tensions over high housing costs in this tech-boom city have spurred a contentious ballot measure in next month's municipal election that takes aim at home-sharing sites such as <span class="companylink">Airbnb Inc</span>. by limiting short-term home rentals to 75 nights a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measure F, dubbed the “<span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> initiative," would also authorize the city to fine such sites for listing apartments that aren't registered with the city as short-term rentals, and allow neighbors to pursue hosts and companies in private lawsuits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nov. 3 ballot measure is a key test for <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>, a San Francisco-based startup recently valued at $25.5 billion, on its home turf as it faces a variety of regulatory challenges[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/airbnb-says-it-doesnt-want-to-bulldoze-our-way-to-success-like-uber-1445020468] in cities where it operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measure is being backed by tenant-rights organizations as well as a group representing landlords.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, it has split prominent local politicians, drawing support from Democrat U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and opposition from fellow Democrats Mayor Ed Lee and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is running for governor of California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proponents say the measure is needed because short-term rental sites such as <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> are taking housing units off the market in San Francisco at a time when the city is experiencing a shortage of affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average asking rent in the city hit $2,828 a month for a studio apartment during the first nine months of the year, according to real estate data company RealFacts. That compares to an average rent of $2,575 for the same kind of unit in 2014. San Francisco's median home price was $1,097,000 in September, a nearly 17% increase from the same month last year, according to real estate data company <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have the worst housing crunch this city has suffered since the 1906 earthquake—we cannot build housing fast enough," said Dale A. Carlson, a media consultant in the city who wrote the measure, and whose “Share Better" campaign has raised $356,000 to pass it, with the largest contribution coming from a hotel workers union. “So to lose housing units for tourist accommodations—it is just insanity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> and its supporters are fighting back with an $8 million political campaign. Over the summer, the company hired Chris Lehane, a former consultant to former President Bill Clinton and veteran of California political fights, to serve as the company's head of global policy and public affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lehane said the initiative does nothing to address affordable housing and makes it more difficult for San Franciscans who are dealing with high housing costs to get by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This initiative, at the end of the day, is an attack on the middle class of San Francisco, who share their homes to help make ends meet," Mr. Lehane said. “Home-sharing in this city is a lifeline for thousands."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics of the measure are particularly concerned about a provision that would allow neighbors of sites being rented to take the company, and those who use it, to court. The critics say the provision would be subject to abuse. They also oppose a provision that would require people who host homes on home-sharing sites in the city to file reports on a quarterly basis, indicating the number of days the unit is occupied by the homeowner or primary tenant and when it is rented out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measure is part of a long-running political debate over <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> and other sites in the city. Last year, the city's Board of Supervisors passed a law regulating home-sharing in the city, limiting home-sharing to 90 days a year when a host isn't home, but activists still feel the measure didn't go far enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In particular, they say the city has no way to penalize a company, even if it lists a home that has been subject to certain types of evictions or that has been designated as affordable or below-market-rate housing by the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> measure isn't the only housing-related fight San Francisco voters will consider. Voters will be asked to approve $310 million in bond funds to finance, build and acquire affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another would institute an 18-month ban on housing construction of any kind other than affordable housing in the city's rapidly gentrifying Mission District, once the heart of this city's Latino community, now a popular destination for technology workers. The Board of Supervisors failed to pass a 45-day moratorium on luxury housing construction[http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/developments/2015/06/02/san-francisco-to-vote-on-luxury-housing-moratorium/] in the area in June.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel   </div><div>618 words</div><div>23 October 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home sales sagged over the summer in the elite, second-home market of Long Island's East End, including the Hamptons, they surged across the island's vast middle-class expanses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were up 13.4% in the third quarter, rising to the highest level in 12 years on Long Island, excluding the East End, according to market reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in sales mirrored -- and, by some measures, surpassed -- increases seen across the region and the nation as economic growth has picked up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers and analysts said the rise also reflected falling inventory of homes for sale, low mortgage-interest rates and worries those rates might rise in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales growth was particularly strong in parts of the region that had lagged the high-end markets that recovered strongly in the past few years both in the city and in wealthier suburban neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The high end has leveled out," said Dottie Herman, president of Douglas Elliman. "The South Shore took longer to recover and it has recovered."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers said the suburban sales surge also reflected rising interest in those areas from buyers from New York City who were looking for more space and at lower cost. Prices in Manhattan and Brooklyn have soared in the past few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our strongest market is from people from Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan coming to the South Shore," said Scott Wallace, a broker at the Garden City office of Daniel Gale Sotheby's International Realty. "A couple of years ago they were single, now they have gone from single to married to expecting children."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were down 20% in the Hamptons and 16.2% on the North Fork from the same quarter last year, according to a market report by <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> released on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc. who prepared the Elliman report, said he had also seen heavier volumes than usual in Westchester and Fairfield counties. Sales in Westchester were the highest in 34 years, he said. "Some of it is residents of the city seeking affordability," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strongest gains in both sales and prices were on the South Shore of Nassau County, in suburban towns with modest commutes to Manhattan, where the recovery had lagged in part because of the lingering effects of flooding from superstorm Sandy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Nassau's South Shore, sales were up 14.3% from the same quarter in 2014, and median prices were up 7.9% during the same period. Across Long Island, excluding the East End, the median price rose 2.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Louise Pitlake, a broker at Elliman who sells many homes in Merrick, said that after Sandy, a lot of people walked away from damaged homes and sold them to developers who built new homes. But the uncertainty created by new flood maps and rising flood-insurance costs chilled sales for a while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, Igor Kogan, a lawyer, and his wife, Mila, who works for a bank, paid $875,000 for a Colonial-style house on Elliot Street in Merrick, "mainly for the kids," Mr. Kogan said. They had been living in a two-bedroom co-op in Forest Hills, Queens, with their two children, now 2 and 4. He likes the location near a canal, with a spacious back yard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The kids have a lot of freedom to go nuts and run around," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Hamptons, with fewer sales at the top and at the bottom, the average sale price was down 1.7%, while the median price rose 9.8%, according the Elliman report.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes swung to a big increase in September, putting the market back on track for its strongest year since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales climbed 4.7% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.55 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Thursday, just shy of the postrecession high touched in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September's gains came on the heels of an unexpectedly weak August. The NAR on Thursday revised down August's figure to 5.3 million from an initial estimate of 5.31 million. Stock-market turbulence and uncertainty about interest rates might have prompted some buyers to hold off on making purchases in August, economists noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The September pace was 8.8% above a year ago at this time. The increase puts the market on pace for its best year since before the recession. Better job growth, continued low mortgage rates and pent-up demand are fueling activity, according to Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the peak in February 2007, existing-home sales touched a recent high of 5.79 million. The average from 2010 to 2014 was 4.6 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is less certainty about whether the U.S. housing market can sustain its robust activity into next year. Employment generally has been strong in 2015, but the pace of job creation slowed in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have this list of things that worry me about how can we sustain this," said Richard Moody, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Regions Financial Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among his biggest concerns: first-time home buyers. The share of such purchasers fell to 29% of sales in September from 32% in August. New buyers are critical to the long-term health of the housing market because they represent new demand, not just existing homeowners trading properties among themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest problem for young purchasers is that home prices are rising much faster than incomes. The national median home price was $221,900 in September, up 6.1% from a year earlier. Incomes, by contrast, have been growing at roughly 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That makes it more difficult for potential buyers to save for a down payment on a home, especially in regions like the South and West, where home prices have risen the fastest over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An increase of college-educated professionals and a lack of new construction have helped drive up prices, said Matthew Brennan, a real-estate agent with real estate brokerage Redfin in Portland, Ore. His local market is "kind of crazy right now," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combination of rising prices and affordability constraints is beginning to weigh on the market. Redfin said sellers of 25% of homes on the market in September dropped their asking prices, up from 20% a year ago, suggesting the strong market has swelled sellers' expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It looks to us that the healthy market is seducing sellers to list a little stronger than they should," said Nela Richardson, chief economist at Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lack of inventory, and especially a dearth of new-home construction, is feeding the problem. Inventory stood at 4.8 months of supply, down from 5.1 months in August, according to the Realtors group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Come spring of next year, based on the current trend, we find we could be facing really tight inventory situation once the spring buying season returns, unless home builders really ramp up production," Mr. Yun said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Adam Bonislawski   </div><div>414 words</div><div>23 October 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rise in gas prices can drive up the cost of everything from a gallon of milk to a cup of coffee. But it can reduce the cost of buying a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For every $1 increase in gas prices, home prices drop by $4,060, according to a working paper from faculty at Longwood University and <span class="companylink">Florida Atlantic University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This effect is even more pronounced when a relatively inexperienced agent is handling the sale: The study finds that in such cases, a $1 rise in gas prices translates to a roughly $6,600 decline in house prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What accounts for this phenomenon? In part, says study author Bennie Waller, professor of finance and real estate at Longwood, high gas prices may lead agents to market properties less aggressively. Specifically, when prices are high, agents may try to minimize the miles they drive in showing homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Waller notes that gas prices influence many factors -- such as disposable income and consumer sentiment -- that also affect the housing market. But, he says, the fact that gas costs have a disproportionate effect on sales by inexperienced agents (defined as those working four years or fewer as an agent) indicates that a reluctance to run down their gas tanks in pursuit of a deal also plays a role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A high gas price is "a fixed cost for all agents, but older agents can spread it out over lots of transactions, whereas younger, less experienced agents don't have a lot of transactions to spread those fixed costs over," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Waller and his co-author, FAU professor Ken Johnson, looked at 17,122 homes listed for sale on a central Virginia MLS between 1999 and 2009, correlating this data with average monthly per-gallon gas prices for Virginia as reported by the <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Energy</span>. Over the period studied, gas prices averaged $2.34 per gallon and ranged between a low of $1.11 and a high of $4.12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should sellers go to market before gas prices rise? No rush, says Timothy Hess, a petroleum-markets analyst with the <span class="companylink">U.S. Energy Information Administration</span>. According to agency projections, per-gallon prices will average around $2.42 in 2015 and around $2.38 in 2016.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing homes rose 4.7% in September to the second-highest pace in eight years as low interest rates and pent-up demand supported the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose in September from August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.55 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase marked the fourth month of gains in the past five months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September's rise follows a sharp drop in August, which came on the heels of three straight months of gains. August's sales were revised down to 5.3 million from an initial estimate of 5.31 million. The national median home price was $221,900 in September, up 6.1% from September 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been relatively robust in many markets across the U.S. Prices have risen on an annual basis for more than three straight years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of existing homes for sale stood at 4.8 months' worth of supply at the current pace of sales, down from 5.1 months in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the NAR, said the low inventory was less worrisome now in the softer fall and winter selling season but could be an issue in the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Come spring of next year, based on the current trend, we find we could be facing [a] really tight inventory situation . . . unless home builders really ramp up production," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were up in all four U.S. regions in September, with the biggest percentage increase in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The action was concentrated in sales of single-family homes, which rose 5.3% from August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate of sales of existing condominiums and co-ops was unchanged from August at 620,000, up 3.3% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes typically stayed on the market for 49 days in September, down from 56 days in September 2014 but up from 47 days in August. Time on the market also was 44% longer than the average of 34 days in June, which was the shortest period since the NAR began tracking these figures in 2011.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index of U.S. home-builder confidence is released by the National Association of Home Builders. A U.S. News article Wednesday about the housing market incorrectly said the National Association of Realtors releases the index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJA October 23, 2015)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home building rebounded in September, driven by a boost in multifamily construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 6.5% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.21 million in September, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. The increase was due to an 18.3% surge in multifamily units, which include apartments and condominiums. Starts of single-family homes, which make up nearly two-thirds of the market, barely budged, rising 0.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New applications for building permits, an indication of future construction, fell 5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-construction figures can be volatile and subject to significant revisions. Tuesday's report showed new-home starts for August were revised to a 1.7% decline, compared with an initial estimate of a 3% decrease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year-to-date, housing starts are up 12% and building permits are up 13%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing construction remains subdued by historical standards even though other indications suggest the housing market may be firming. New-home sales rose in July and August, although sales have yet to reach their prerecession levels. Sales of existing homes, however, slipped in August, perhaps because of rising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low interest rates, a stronger job market and rising rents have led more people to look for homes to buy. But a shortage of supply in some areas, combined with slow-rising wages, may make purchases difficult. That could be changing. Builders completed more housing units in September, on a seasonally adjusted annual basis, than at any point since November 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders remain hopeful despite the uncertainty in the housing market. An index of home-builder confidence released Monday by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> rose to 64, higher than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The underlying story is that housing demand is quite strong, and builders are slowly but surely ramping up their groundbreaking to meet the need," wrote Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another gauge of the housing market will come Thursday when the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> releases new data on existing-home sales.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stock indexes ended lower Tuesday, as declines in health-care shares and a downbeat report from <span class="companylink">International Business Machines</span> kept a lid on gains in other sectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 13.43 points, or 0.1%, to 17217.11. The <span class="companylink">S&amp;P 500</span> slipped 0.1% to 2030.77, while the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> Composite fell 0.5% to 4880.97.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.4% to 362.67.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., <span class="companylink">IBM</span> shares slid 5.7% after the company reported lower quarterly revenue for the 14th straight quarter. <span class="companylink">IBM</span> also lowered its earnings per share guidance for the fiscal year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Harley-Davidson</span> tumbled 14% after it reported weaker-than-expected earnings and planned layoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health-care stocks, which investors have punished in recent weeks amid politicians' increased scrutiny of drug pricing, fell Tuesday. The <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span>'s health-care index was off 1.8% in afternoon trading. Merck shares closed down 1.9%, while <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> fell 1.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors were also studying economic data from the U.S. and China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese economy grew 6.9% in the third quarter, according to data released Monday, its slowest rate of expansion since 2009. While better than expected, the figure did little to allay concerns that the world's second-largest economy is slowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Global growth concerns remain," said Patrick Zweifel, chief economist at Pictet Asset Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some companies are adjusting to challenges in China. <span class="companylink">Pizza Hut</span> and <span class="companylink">KFC</span> owner <span class="companylink">Yum Brands</span> said it would split off its China business. Yum shares rose 1.9% in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts rose 6.5% in September from a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But investors are still focused on whether the <span class="companylink">U.S. Federal Reserve</span> will raise interest rates this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's the same drill. The markets are hostage to the Fed," said Ted Weisberg, a trader at <span class="companylink">Seaport Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Europe, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 slipped 0.1% to 6345.13. Germany's DAX fell 0.2% to 10147.68. France's CAC 40 declined 0.6% to 4673.81.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors in Europe are looking forward to the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span>'s meeting Thursday. Expectations have grown that <span class="companylink">the ECB</span> will expand its stimulus program, also known as quantitative easing, or QE, before the end of the year to combat sagging inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"None of the central banks were able to stop QE when they initially thought, and they had to extend it," said Christel Aranda-Hassel, an economist at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Aranda-Hassel said she expects <span class="companylink">the ECB</span> to announce an extension of its QE program until March 2017 or beyond in December. <span class="companylink">The ECB</span> has previously said it would buy 60 billion euros ($68 billion) of public-sector securities each month until at least September 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asian stocks were mixed.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of home-builder sentiment rose to a 10-year high in October, a sign of momentum for a key sector of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> housing-market index climbed to 64 this month, the trade group said Monday. A reading over 50 means most builders generally see conditions in the single-family housing market as positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index stood at 61 in both August and September. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a reading of 62 in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index has been positive since mid-2014 and in recent months has risen to levels last seen before the housing bubble burst. In October 2005, it registered at 68 but just one year later had plummeted to 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With firm job creation, economic growth and the release of pent-up demand, we expect housing to keep moving forward as we start to close out 2015," said NAHB Chief Economist David Crowe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alongside rising employment, low mortgage rates have helped fuel demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With mixed signals from other sectors of the economy, the chances of a <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> interest-rate increase in 2015 are diminishing. That would help keep mortgage rates at historically low levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.82% for the week ending Thursday, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That was the 12th straight week below 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite a broadly upbeat report, the home-builders group warned of potential choke points for the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our members continue to tell us there are still pockets of softness in some markets across the nation and that they face challenges regarding the availability of lots and labor," said NAHB Chairman Tom Woods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More housing data is due out later this week, including the Commerce Department's report on housing starts on Tuesday and the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>' report on existing-home sales on Thursday.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson and Jeffrey Sparshott   </div><div>884 words</div><div>13 October 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders this year have booked their strongest sales since the recession. A shortage of construction workers, however, is making it tough for them to deliver all those new homes on time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. residential construction spending in August climbed above $36 billion, the highest monthly total since October 2007, according to government data. Yet there were 676,500 fewer workers in residential construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delays, economists and builders said, could dent builders' profits in the short term due to higher labor costs and concessions to buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Eventually, the higher costs, if we want these projects to go forward faster, are going to mean passing on the costs" to buyers, said Bernard Markstein, president of Markstein Advisors and a construction-industry consultant. That could price out some buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders, contractors and economists point to a few reasons for the shortage. Wages, particularly in residential construction, are too low to attract enough qualified workers to the physical and sometimes dangerous work of building houses. Tightened immigration policies, meanwhile, are deterring foreign labor from returning to the U.S. And efforts to train and recruit young trade workers atrophied in past years as many school districts focused less on certain vocational training.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The labor shortage has led to costly delays. Seventy-four builders surveyed in September by industry tracker John Burns Real Estate Consulting Inc. have reported slowdowns as long as two months as they wait for carpenters, drywall workers, foundation pourers and others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas builder <span class="companylink">CastleRock Communities LP</span> now needs an average of 155 days to complete a house, up from its historical average of about 115 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our flooring contractors are having a hard time finding enough guys to lay tile," said Lance Wright, a partner in CastleRock. "Plumbing is three weeks out. Everything that used to be a three- to five-day lead time is now three weeks to 30 days out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction-labor shortages aren't unheard of during housing-market recoveries, but this shortfall is more extreme than usual, economists said. Overall, the residential industry has regained less than a third of the roughly 1.5 million jobs lost from 2006 to 2011. An analysis by the <span class="companylink">Associated General Contractors of America</span> found that the number of jobless workers with construction experience dropped last month to the lowest September level since 2000, a development the trade group attributes to a dearth of available workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the housing market is heating up. New-home sales, which historically account for about 10% of all home sales, are up 21% in the first eight months of this year from the year-earlier period, while the ranks of home-construction workers are up only 4.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., the second-largest U.S. builder by homes sold, said labor costs in its most recent quarter rose 10% from a year earlier. <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>., which builds in nine states, in September lowered its earnings forecast, due in part to higher labor costs and deferred revenue and profit due to delayed home completions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some builders are offering concessions. In Columbia, S.C., McGuinn Homes has paid for two families to stay at a Hilton Garden Inn for the past month as their homes near completion. McGuinn, which builds about 150 homes a year in South Carolina, is about 30 to 45 days behind schedule, and the hotel is costing it $200 per night per family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If I promise something and I can't deliver it, I'm going to make it right," Chief Executive Wade McGuinn said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing analysts said the shortage could eventually lead to even higher prices. Already, the median price for newly built homes in August was $292,700, just 3.3% shy of the record set last year, due to roughly five years of builders aggressively increasing prices as far as buyers allowed and building increasingly larger homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Blue Springs, Mo., builder Tom Woods said it takes six to eight weeks to line up a framing crew, versus less than two weeks last year. Their rates, he added, have climbed as high as $8 per square foot from the $5.50 to $6 range. Electricians, bricklayers and other subcontractors are also charging more, he said. That ripples through significantly to home prices, Mr. Woods said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national average pay for residential-construction workers was $26.32 an hour in August, compared with $25.10 for all private-sector jobs, according to Labor Department. That isn't enough of a premium to entice people to leave other jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To get people back onto the construction site, we're going to have to pay a lot more," said Christopher Huebner, owner of HSCB Homes LLC, a framing contractor in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Juan Antonio Rivera worked as a carpenter and painter in Texas for 12 years, leaving in 2013 to rejoin his family and trade cattle in the Mexican city of Tempoal. He said he now earns twice to nearly three times as much each week as the $700 to $800 he made in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm doing excellent -- much better than in the U.S.," said Mr. Rivera, 44 years old.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Joe Light   </div><div>521 words</div><div>12 October 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New federal mortgage rules and expectations of rising interest rates are affecting lending and could weigh on the housing market over the longer term, but reports this week could shed light on whether signs of headwinds are fleeting or of growing concern</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>., <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span>. are set to announce their third-quarter results this week, providing a window into the health of the mortgage and housing markets. In August, sales of previously owned homes were at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 5.31 million, 6% greater than August 2014, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. But sales were 4.8% off their July pace, and the NAR's pending home-sales index, which is based on signings for home purchases, declined 1.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders' figures and their comments on home buyers' loans should offer a glimpse into the overall market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new mortgage rules, effective at the beginning of October, are designed to make it easier for borrowers to understand mortgage terms. But the requirements also have led to new processes and technical challenges that could lead to disruptions in home closings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, those fears haven't played out, said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun. The trade group has reached out to real-estate agents for signs of any disruptions, but hasn't heard of anything significant, he said. But Mr. Yun added that the real test won't occur until the first big slug of home closings under the new regime begins in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Hopefully, this is like a Y2K event. The clock turns but nothing happens," he said, referring to the fear that computers would fail on Jan. 1, 2000, in the new century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The banks also could shed light on whether mortgage affordability and availability concerns are starting to rear their heads again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 3.76% in the week ended Oct. 8 from 3.85% a week earlier, which helps affordability by reducing the borrowing cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, some banks have begun to pull back from some types of mortgage lending in response to proposed federal rules they say would open them up to too much liability for minor errors in making mortgages. That reduces mortgage availability for certain borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing analysts will look to bank executives' comments for clues on whether these trends are accelerating. <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>, for example, already has largely pulled out of lending through the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>, a primary avenue for loans to first-time home buyers and others with relatively poor credit or little money for a down payment. <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> in September said it would raise the minimum credit score it will accept on <span class="companylink">FHA</span> loans to 640 from 600, a reversal of its loosening in February 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On net, the new restrictions "could add downward pressure on credit availability," said <span class="companylink">Compass Point Research &amp; Trading</span> analyst Fred Small in a note to clients.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel   </div><div>543 words</div><div>8 October 2015</div><div>00:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world's love affair with everything Brooklyn is translating into record high home prices across the borough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A series of reports being released Thursday show the median price in Brooklyn during the third quarter soared to a record for homes overall, as well as for the individual co-op, condo and one- to three-family home categories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home prices have been rising across the country, median price gains in Brooklyn exceeded those in Manhattan, and outpaced the 4.7% gain in existing single-family home prices across the U.S. in the year ended in September, according to S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strength in pricing in Brooklyn extended from near-record prices in Brownstone Brooklyn to records in newly fashionable neighborhoods in south Brooklyn that are beginning to attract younger buyers priced out of Manhattan and other popular Brooklyn neighborhoods, brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Brooklyn brand is taking over neighborhood after neighborhood," said Aleksandra Scepanovic, managing director of Ideal Properties Group. “We are talking about a different type of buyer starting to pay attention."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for a Brooklyn co-op, condo or one- to three-family home rose 15% in the third quarter from the same period in 2014, according to a report by appraiser Jonathan Miller by <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sarah E. Burke, who oversees sales for Elliman in Brooklyn, said prices were driven higher, especially on houses and condominiums, because of sharply reduced inventory. “Demand is very high," she said. She said many buyers now see Brooklyn as a “first destination," while others are looking farther out in Brooklyn for more space at a lower cost than in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listing inventory shrank sharply in all categories in the third quarter. The average listing was on the market for 55 days, down 40% from a year earlier and the shortest listing average in eight years, the Elliman report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report by <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> said the number of contracts signed in the third quarter was up 9% from the same period in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Percesepe, who oversees Brooklyn sales for Corcoran, said the “summer was pretty frenetic," leading to an extreme shortage of inventory this fall. “There is a little bit of a pause," he said, adding that “we are still doing plenty of business."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Brownstone Brooklyn, from Brooklyn Heights to Park Slope, the median sale price was $2.36 million, up 31.9% from the same quarter last year, just before a sharp uptick in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In South Brooklyn, the median sale price was up 18.5%, to $560,000. Brokers said new groups of buyers are discovering neighborhoods like Bay Ridge, Gowanus, Cypress Hills and Kensington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tara Power, a television producer and her husband, Jeremy Derbyshire-Myles, an art director, fell in love with a two-bedroom co-op with a terrace in on Ocean Parkway in Kensington, after touring more than 50 apartments with their broker Sully Klein from Ideal Properties. “It just started getting its first cool coffee shops, bars and restaurants," she said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By M.K. Quinlan   </div><div>893 words</div><div>2 October 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Europe Edition)</div><div>WSJE</div><div>W10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The locals nicknamed Sullivan's Island, a quaint 2.5-square-mile enclave off the coast of South Carolina, "Mayberry by the Sea." But if Sheriff Andy Taylor were around today, he might have trouble paying $1.4 million -- the island's median sale price -- for a home here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This historic beach town -- population 1,790 -- has long been a well-kept secret among South Carolinians. But with the explosive growth of nearby Charleston, where <span class="companylink">Boeing Co</span>. is rapidly building out its 265-acre campus and <span class="companylink">Volvo</span> is set to open its first U.S. plant in 2018, word of Sullivan's Island's charms is spreading. Now buyers from New York, California and even London are staking their claim on the island, just a 15-minute drive from Charleston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're going to sell more houses on Sullivan's Island in 2015 than we ever have in history," said Everett Presson, a real-estate agent who has practiced on the island for 37 years. At the market's peak in 2005, 45 of the island's 900 homes were sold. In 2015, 39 home sales have closed through August. With demand high and only 41 homes on the market, the median sales price has increased by 15% since 2014 to $1.4 million, according to data from Charleston Trident MLS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though summer is Sullivan's Island's busiest season, 80% of its residents live there full-time, according to Mr. Presson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After traveling from Knoxville, Tenn., to the island for a wedding in 2003, Cortney and Baker Bishop fell in love with the "easy, breezy, preppy-cool lifestyle" of Sullivan's, Mrs. Bishop, a 42-year-old interior designer said. They set their sights on a circa-1890 traditional low-country home where she had attended a cocktail party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They purchased it a year later for $1.8 million. The house includes five bedrooms, five baths, a pool, and is two blocks from the beach, two blocks from the island's marsh front and two blocks from a new oceanfront elementary school. "This house is the best decision I've made in my entire life, for my whole family," said Mrs. Bishop, whose two young children attend the new school. "I mean, what place in the United States can you still just take off on your bike without your parents in the third grade?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Hamontree, a former medical executive, and his wife, Lynne, an artist, both in their late 50s, are happy to have settled in a place that doesn't feel like a retirement community. "There are families with young kids and there are single people who aren't yet married," said Mr. Hamontree. "This variety in the people makes for a real sense of community."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With their two children grown and out of the house, they've listed the 5,000-square-foot home they purchased for $2.5 million in 2006 with the hopes of building something smaller elsewhere on the island. The four-bedroom, 4 1/2-bath home includes a pool, an expansive third-story screened-in porch, and a light-filled fourth-floor artist's studio. The rooftop deck has 360-degree views of the island and its surrounding waterways. They're asking $2.5 million for the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The island's allure is due, in large part, to a handful of ordinances passed over the past 30 years that have blocked the development of high-rise condos and the kind of spring break-style debauchery that has plagued other East Coast beach towns. "We've outlawed weekly rentals, so you don't have a bunch of people partying in the house next to you," said Mr. Presson, who served on the town council from 2005 to 2009. You can't construct a building over 38 feet tall, or a home over 5,600 square feet, even if you bought 10 contiguous lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Wes Fuller, 41, the executive managing director of investments for Greystar, a Charleston-based international real-estate firm, his wife Betsy and their three young kids, easy access to the beach and the marsh was a big factor in their decision to buy on Sullivan's Island in 2012. "Whether you want to go surfing, or paddle boarding, or fishing, or whether you just want to go swimming in the ocean, you have all of those options on Sullivan's," said Mr. Fuller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're selling their newly built 3,700-square-foot, five-bedroom, 4 1/2-bathroom house for $2.475 million after a recent relocation to London for Mr. Fuller's job. They purchased a larger, 0.90-acre marsh-front lot earlier this year for $1.35 million, where they plan to build a bigger home upon their return to the U.S. in 2016.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices grew steadily in July, according to a report released Tuesday, underscoring the housing market's strong run in the first half of the year, even as more recent indicators suggest that it is slowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, covering existing single-family homes across the U.S., rose 4.7% in the 12 months ended in July, outpacing June's 4.5% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index of 10 major cities gained 4.5% from a year earlier, roughly the same as in June. The 20-city index gained 5%, slightly more than in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indicators of the housing market's strength have been mixed in recent weeks. Price growth remains strong, but the pace of sales of existing homes slumped in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said a forward-looking indicator of the housing market -- its pending home-sales index, based on signings for purchases of previously owned homes -- declined 1.4%. (<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, which owns The Wall Street Journal, also owns realtor.com, the listing website of the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said this opaque national picture in part reflects disparities among housing markets across the country, which vary with the health of local economies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We got so used to this being a national story because the crash was extremely national," as was the increase in prices as the market recovered, said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at real-estate website Zillow. "Now that we're starting to slow down, we can see these trends emerging that are very local."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-to-month price gains were tepid. Between June and July, the national index -- not seasonally adjusted -- rose 0.7%, while the 10-city and 20-city indexes were up 0.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After seasonal adjustment, the U.S. index was up 0.4%. The 10-city and 20-city composite were both down 0.2%, with prices declining in 11 of 20 metro areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets in the western part of the country are for the most part stronger than those in the East. Most metropolitan areas west of the Mississippi saw price gains from June to July, while most cities east of that line saw declines. After seasonal adjustment, Chicago saw prices decline 1.2% and the New York area saw prices fall 0.5%. Prices, meanwhile, grew 0.8%, seasonally adjusted, in San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over time, the divide between California cities and some of their Rust Belt counterparts has become even more apparent. Home prices in Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego have more than doubled since January 2000. In Detroit they have grown just 3% since then, and in Cleveland just 10%, according to Case-Shiller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's some really strong cities, and then there's Detroit at the other end of the spectrum," said David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the Index Committee at <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span><span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market has slowed in recent months, a development that most economists see as healthy: Prices in many markets were increasing faster than incomes, they note, making it difficult for younger buyers to afford a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Selma Hepp, chief economist at real-estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, owned by <span class="companylink">Zillow Group</span>, noted that prices for the most affordable homes continue to rise sharply, even as gains on the luxury end have slowed. Prices at the lowest price tier in Denver increased 16% and in Atlanta they increased 12% in the year ended in July, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Buyers are worried about too-high prices and are more cautious about making offers," said Karen Krupsaw, vice president of real-estate operations at Redfin, a real-estate brokerage. "We're seeing that sellers are getting the memo, as more people are dropping their prices in the past few weeks."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Downtown Brooklyn's higher-education institutions drew some 60,000 students and generated $2.8 billion in economic activity in 2013, according to report released Tuesday by a civic group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report from the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership analyzed the nine schools in the neighborhood and measured direct spending by their administrations, their construction spending, labor costs and estimated student spending. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like other parts of New York City, downtown Brooklyn has seen an uptick in higher-education activity over the past decade. <span class="companylink">NYU</span> has expanded its facilities in the area, <span class="companylink">Brooklyn Law School</span> has added to its faculty, and the New York City College of Technology broke ground on a new academic complex. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It occurred to me we needed to start to sell the wealth of the higher-education sector here in Brooklyn," said Eddie Summers, executive director of the Brooklyn Education Innovation Network, a part of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership that oversaw the study. The network was founded earlier this year to link higher-education institutions in the area to local businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You see students shopping at the Fulton Mall, you see faculty and staff at cafes," he said, “but what surprised me is that the impact was this large." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The leading contributors to the $2.8 billion in economic activity were <span class="companylink">NYU</span>, the New York City College of Technology, <span class="companylink">Long Island University</span>, and Pratt Institute. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If I look outside my window, I can see 360 degrees of cranes building in Brooklyn," said Nick Allard, the president of Brooklyn Law School, which also participated in the study. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">                                                                            In other parts of the city, encroaching higher-education institutions have been met with pushback. <span class="companylink">NYU</span>'s expansion plan was challenged in court by a group of local residents, faculty, and preservationists, but the school prevailed. <span class="companylink">Columbia University</span> has faced criticism for its expansion in West Harlem. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooklyn borough President Eric Adams cheered the findings in an interview on Tuesday. “Brooklyn is a real college town," he said. “When you generate $3 billion that's nothing to laugh about or sneeze at." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He pointed to a merger between <span class="companylink">NYU</span> and Polytechnic University, completed in early 2014, as helping the area to grow as a hub of higher-education. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenwich Village, where <span class="companylink">NYU</span> is based, is “oversaturated," he said, but Brooklyn “won't have an issue of oversaturation….We're taking into account demand when we are building."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Violent Incidents Fell</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moderately in 2014</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Violent crime fell slightly in the U.S. last year, according to data released Monday by the <span class="companylink">Federal Bureau of Investigation</span>, although big-city police chiefs recently said the number of killings this year appears to be rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the <span class="companylink">FBI</span>, the number of violent crimes fell 0.2% in 2014 compared with the previous year. Property crimes decreased by 4.3%, according to the data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the Major Cities Chiefs Association held a meeting in Washington to discuss a spike in killings this summer. Some law-enforcement officials fear that trend may signal an end to two decades of falling crime rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 11 million people were arrested in 2014, and about 73% of them were male.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Murder and manslaughters decreased 0.5% to 13,472, according to the <span class="companylink">FBI</span> estimates, while robberies fell 5.6%. Rape and aggravated assaults increased about 2%, the agency said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In announcing the data, FBI Director James Comey appealed to law-enforcement agencies around the U.S. to help close a major information gap by providing reliable figures for how many people are shot by police officers each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local, state, and federal law-enforcement agencies have come under growing scrutiny and criticism recently for not disclosing how many people are killed by officers each year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—A forward-looking gauge of U.S. home sales slipped in August, further evidence that the surge in momentum in the first half of the year has slowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday its pending home sales index, which is based on signings for purchases of previously owned homes, declined 1.4%[http://www.realtor.org/topics/pending-home-sales] to a seasonally-adjusted 109.4 in August, from a reading of 110.9 in July. The group blamed the dip on rising prices and a limited supply of homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report suggests home sales could soften in the third quarter. Still, it isn't necessarily cause for broader concern about the housing market, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While the report is a negative development, mortgage applications are on an upward trend while supply is tighter—both suggest the drop in pending home sales will be short-lived," <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> economist Bricklin Dwyer said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 0.4% rise in August. Home sales typically close within a couple months after signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales are still well above where they were a year ago. The index rose 6.1% in August from a year earlier, the 12th consecutive annual increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Even with existing-housing supply barely budging all summer and no relief coming from new construction, contract activity is still higher than earlier this year and a year ago," Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors' group, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also owns <span class="companylink">Move Inc</span>., which operates a website and mobile products for the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other recent data point to steady demand in the housing market this summer. Sales of new, single-family home sales, which account for about 10% of the market, rose by 5.7%[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-up-5-7-in-august-1443103942] last month. Meanwhile, the pace of completed existing-home sales has returned to its prerecession levels, although sales slipped in August[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-down-4-8-in-august-1442844601] after a strong start to the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Despite the recent weakness evident in the data on the existing home sales market, we maintain a relatively upbeat view on the housing market more generally," <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> economist Daniel Silver said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite a large increase in sales, new construction of single-family homes only increased 8.7% from a year ago in August, according to data from the Commerce Department. But builder sentiment is the highest it has been in nearly a decade[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-home-builder-confidence-hits-near-decade-high-1439820086], according to a survey of home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stronger job gains have also helped build momentum in the housing market. Interest rates also remain at historical lows. The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.91% in August, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the lowest it has been since May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun said sales in the coming months should be able to maintain their current pace, but he warned a looming government shutdown and further stock-market volatility could cause some buyers to put off home purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Monday's report, pending home sales rose modestly in the West, but declined in every other region.</p>

</div><div class="author">Douglas Feiden   </div><div>898 words</div><div>25 September 2015</div><div>22:34</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sofas and stoves were ripped out of homes in Brighton Beach and hurled onto the boardwalk as superstorm Sandy raged. A flotilla of cars, propelled by a 9-foot storm surge, slammed into apartment buildings, their horns honking, recalled Pat Singer, a resident since 1964. Afterward, soldiers and troopers patrolled half-empty streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I thought we had lost the neighborhood," said Ms. Singer, the executive director and founder of the <span class="companylink">Brighton Neighborhood Association</span>. Barely a month later, shops reopened, home repairs began and people returned. “That old fighting immigrant spirit asserted itself," she said. “We were coming back."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of real estate quickly resumed its ascent as Cyrillic-lettered signs were repainted and Siberian dumplings, Georgian flatbreads and horseradish-flavored Ukrainian vodka were served again in cafes and nightspots in “Little Odessa," as Brighton Beach is also known.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the median asking price for all Brighton Beach homes, a classic measure of market optimism, hit $589,000 this year, up 23% from $479,000 in 2013, the year after Sandy devastated the south Brooklyn beach communities, according to StreetEasy, a real-estate database.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is a community that's not to be intimidated by Mother Nature," said Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first eight months of 2015, the median sales price for condos, co-ops and one-, two- and three-family homes soared to $475,000, up 32% from $360,000 in the same period in 2012 before the superstorm struck that October, said Jonathan Miller, president of appraisal firm Miller Samuel. There have been 140 sales so far this year, edging up from 135 at the same point in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a place known for more humble inventory, a few megasales of oceanfront condos at $1 million and up accounted for the price jump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the most expensive known sale took place only eight months after Sandy, at 125 Oceana Dr. East, when a 2,800-square-foot, three-bedroom duplex penthouse traded for $3.5 million, or $1,250 a square foot, Mr. Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's priciest offering: $10 million for a gated waterfront mansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owner Gary Vinbaytel, 46, a Ukraine-born builder of East Village condos, said he upped the tab $2 million last week after receiving multiple offers. “I rolled the dice," he said. “It's worth more."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those are dizzying prices even for Manhattan-fronting areas like Dumbo, Williamsburg and Brooklyn Heights. But they represent a sea change in this one-square mile, historically middle-class enclave bounded by the boardwalk on the south, Shore Parkway on the north, Ocean Parkway on the west and West End Avenue on the east.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The gap between southern Brooklyn and northern and middle Brooklyn has been steadily shrinking," said Jason Muss, 44, a principal at <span class="companylink">Muss Development LLC</span>, whose family constructed the 15-acre Oceana Condominium &amp; Club fronting the Boardwalk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It replaced the Brighton Beach Baths, a members-only pool club that opened in 1907 and was renowned for mah-jongg games, Yiddish-language gossip and performers like Milton Berle and Herman's Hermits. In the 1960s, it had 13,000 members; there were 1,100 when it closed in 1997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Oceana, with 927 high-end units in 16 buildings, was built in phases over the past 14 years and quickly became a magnet for Jewish and other immigrants from the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When we first told people in 2000 we were building condos in south Brooklyn, they looked at us as if we were crazy," Mr. Muss recalls. “But it was a precursor to the overall boom in Brooklyn."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Maseratis and Lamborghinis are often spotted in the Oceana compound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parks: The neighborhood's heart and one of the world's great waterside promenades is the 15-block, 3,900-foot boardwalk that links Brighton Beach to the rollicking amusement district of Coney Island, with its much longer boardwalk to the west, creating an unbroken, 2.6-mile ribbon of parkland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schools: With a population of 32,500, the area has six elementary and middle schools with 3,841 students, and three high schools with 3,466 students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 31% of its third- to eighth-graders are proficient in English Language Arts and 45% in math, according to Insideschools, an independent guide to the city's public schools. Borough-wide performance is weaker, at 25% and 30%, respectively, data shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dining: Café Volna on the Boardwalk offers Seabass Shish-Kebab and Khachapuri, a Georgian cheese-stuffed bread. Rival Tatiana's serves two dumpling-like creations, fried Siberian pelmeni and sweet-cheese vareniki. Also available: Black Sea-style Moldovan dishes and Caspian Sea-style Azerbaijani fare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shopping: Residents and tourists alike can find Russian Ushanka fur and faux fur hats, Fabergé-style eggs and Russian authors nesting dolls at St. Petersburg Global Trade House on Brighton Beach Avenue. Ocean Wine &amp; Liquor sells honey-pepper vodka, bison-grass vodka and Lithuanian black-currant vodka, among 100-plus brands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entertainment: Gambrinus Seafood Café on Ocean Parkway, named for the “patron saint of beer," presents the Yaacov Mayman Jazz Quartet on Thursdays. Tatiana's offers Russian, Gypsy and Ukrainian dancers in perhaps the glitziest floor show east of Vegas. Drink, dance and gawk at showgirls until 3 a.m.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KB's average selling price, meanwhile, increased 9% to $357,200. Higher home sales prices and stronger delivery volume, in addition to land sold during the quarter, pushed revenue up 43% from a year earlier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of newly built homes reached the highest level since early 2008 in August, evidence that demand for housing is strengthening heading into the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new, single-family homes rose by 5.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 552,000, the Commerce Department said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest data "point to robust momentum in new-home sales," said Stephen Stanley, economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities. He said strong readings could continue for several months because weather delays in the first half of the year may cause housing markets to "remain busy later into the year than usual."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest figure marks a new a postrecession high, supplanting February's reading. From February until July, sales had settled somewhat but were well above year-earlier levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data largely indicates low interest rates and stronger job creation are supporting demand for new housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales account for about 10% of the home purchase market, with existing homes making up the rest. Month-to-month data can be volatile; August's increase had a margin of error of plus or minus 16.2 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a year earlier, sales were up 21.6% in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many home builders are reporting steady, year-over-year sales gains in the low double-digit percentages. <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> on Thursday reported a 19% rise in orders in its fiscal quarter ended Aug. 31 from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. posted a 10% gain in orders for its quarter ended Aug. 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our results reflect the slow but steady growth in the overall home-building market," Lennar Chief Executive Stuart Miller said during a conference call with investors. "This year's summer season, and the spring selling season before it, confirm that the market is continuing to improve at a fairly consistent pace."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-builder sentiment is at its highest level in nearly a decade, according to a survey earlier this month from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>. The group reports increased buyer traffic and improving sales conditions. Builders, however, are concerned about future sales conditions, including the expectation that interest rates will rise later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, sales of existing homes have returned to levels recorded just before the recession began in 2007, though they slipped in August after a strong start to the year, according to data from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's report showed August's median sales price of new homes was $292,700, a 0.3% rise from a year earlier. Sales increased most strongly in the Northeast, up 24.1% from July, but declined 9.1% in the Midwest, the only region to see a drop-off.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The 19th-century brick rowhouse on a leafy street in the capital's upscale Dupont Circle neighborhood is the sort of property that normally would spark a bidding war in a hot real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when the elderly owners were ready to sell, the home didn't appear in the local real-estate listings. There was no for-sale sign, or even an open house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, like a growing number of properties sold here and in other major cities, the home was sold as a "pocket listing." Such properties aren't advertised to the public, but pitched mostly by word-of-mouth among tightknit networks of agents and their clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pocket listings -- also known as "whisper" and "coming soon" listings -- have been popular for years among celebrities and the wealthy. But they increasingly are used by a broader segment as the housing market heats up and inventory remains tight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The practice has its critics. Some agents say pocket listings are anticompetitive, preventing sellers from getting full market value. Proponents say such listings are useful if homeowners are looking for a quick sale and understand it might result in a lower price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this case, the owners' agent walked four competing developers through the five-bedroom home one morning last summer. The developers planned to gut it and turn it into a high-end condo building with several units. Two days later, the agent had an offer in hand for $1.76 million, which the couple accepted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the agent knew the buyer, "I didn't need to do any work whatsoever -- not even cleaning," said Jean Kim, an 83-year-old retiree who owned the house with her husband.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renovating the house or even holding a traditional open house would have been impractical because her husband is disabled, Ms. Kim said. The couple didn't get an outside appraisal, she said, adding she was happy with the sale price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data on pocket listings are hard to come by. In D.C., industry officials point to a rise in the share of sales that spent only one day on the main listing database, MRIS, or never appeared on it, as a sign that pocket listings are rising. That share rose to 8.5% in the first eight months of this year from 6.7% in the comparable period five years earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in a strong market, homes typically spend at least a week or two in a listing database, so appearing for only a day can be a telltale sign of a pocket sale. Though it isn't required, some agents list pocket sales in the database so the selling price can be registered, helping them keep better track of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Denver metro area, 15% of homes sold last year were never listed on the main database, up from 7% in 2011, according to its operator, REcolorado.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the five counties that make up California's Silicon Valley, the share of home sales that didn't appear on the main listings database rose to 17% in the first half of 2014 from 13.6% in 2012, according to operator MLSListings Inc. Industry officials in Austin, Texas, and south Florida also have reported increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, which owns The Wall Street Journal, also owns realtor.com, the listing website of the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daryl Judy, Ms. Kim's agent, notes that "buyers really love" access to houses that aren't publicly listed, while sellers have greater control over the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some agents note the practice can lead to problems beyond a lower sale price. Pocket listings punish buyers who lack connections and don't have a chance to bid on properties. There also is the risk of discrimination, whether intentional or unintentional, if a property is shown only to an agent whose clients all happen to be white.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There also is the potential for a conflict of interest when an agent finds a buyer from a colleague in the same brokerage, which then collects fees from the buyer and the seller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State laws don't prohibit pocket listings, but generally require that agents serve their clients' best interests, which includes wide-scale advertising to maximize a property's value, said June Barlow, general counsel at the <span class="companylink">California Association of Realtors</span>. However, many states allow agents to bypass that step if they get their clients' written consent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil B. Garfinkel, an adviser to the Real Estate Board of New York, a trade group, said pocket listings could subject agents to lawsuits if their clients believe they didn't fulfill their fiduciary duty by getting the best price. He wasn't aware of any such suit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend comes amid growing frustration over a shortage of homes up for sale. Nationally, at the current sales pace, it would take 5.2 months to eat up the supply of existing homes on the market, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. That's down from 5.6 months a year earlier and roughly the same level as in 2005, during the housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents who use pocket listings say they can generate an air of exclusivity. One pitch: Pocket listings reduce the risk of a property becoming stigmatized if it is advertised publicly and sits on the market for too long, which can depress the value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Judy said he uses pocket listings only when the seller is fully informed and indicates that a quick sale suits his or her needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some sellers, particularly wealthy ones, don't want to go through the hassle of listing properties and holding open houses, where dozens or hundreds of people trample through, often with no real intent of buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers like Alesia Barfield, a 47-year-old nurse, and her husband, a Defense Department employee, benefit. Transferred to MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla., last year, they toured at least 50 houses but couldn't find what they were looking for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then their agent introduced them to a colleague's client who was thinking about selling. "She said, 'I think we're going to have a listing and I think it's more of what you're looking for,' " Ms. Barfield said.

</div><div class="author">By Anya Martin   </div><div>772 words</div><div>25 September 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I left my wallet in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tech-sector gold rush in recent years has made San Francisco the nation's most expensive place to buy a home, with a median sale price of $1,312,500, according to the <span class="companylink">California Association of Realtors</span> (CAR).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are high in popular areas elsewhere in the state as well. In Los Angeles, the median home price is $486,310. But home buyers who want to live in L.A.'s most desirable areas will pay much more, and inventory is tight, says Eric Lavey, director of the estate division of Beverly Hills-based The Agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Demand is high at every level and every price point," he says. For homes priced at $2 million and under -- even up to $3 million -- the market is "insane" right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of coastal California is basically insane right now, referring to real estate, of course. Yet government-backed conforming loans are capped at $625,500 in high-price areas. So unless they can make a substantial down payment to qualify for a <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> or <span class="companylink">FHA</span> loan, the only way many Californians can finance their mortgage will be a jumbo loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"California is by far the biggest lending state when it comes to jumbo mortgages -- both in dollar amount and number of loans," says Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, which covers the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of the West</span>, which lends in 22 states, has its largest market share in California, says Paul Wible, senior executive vice president. "The ability to lend in the jumbo loan sizes here is critically important," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than half of <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>'s jumbo lending is originated and closed in California, and dollar volume from January through August 2015 was up 20% over a year ago, says Ann Thompson, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>'s regional sales executive for Northern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spring housing market in the Bay Area was "incredibly aggressive," and even in the slower summer, hot properties continued to sell with bidding wars pushing them above list price, says Maggie Visser, an agent with San Francisco-based <span class="companylink">Paragon Real Estate Group</span>. Inventory is tight for single-family homes because there is no land to build new ones, she adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents in San Francisco are notoriously high, driving young professionals -- often in technology or biotechnology jobs -- to want to buy instead, says Mathew Carson, a broker with San Francisco-based First Capital Group. The median monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment there was $3,530 in August, according to rental website Zumper. About 43% of <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>'s California jumbo loans in the first half of 2015 went to first-time home buyers, Ms. Thompson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest challenge for these borrowers isn't income, but having enough money for the 20% down payment, Mr. Carson says. Home buyers who come up short are left with the choice of buying a lower-priced home or paying a higher interest rate for a jumbo with a lower down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 40% of <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>'s borrowers in California opt for a jumbo that requires a 15% down payment on loan amounts up to $1 million, Ms. Thompson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are a few more tips:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Get preapproved. With cash competitors, sellers won't consider an offer from buyers who are borrowing unless a lender has guaranteed that they qualify for the loan amount, Ms. Visser, the real-estate agent, says. Be prepared to waive appraisal and home-inspection contingencies, too, she adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Await a new cap. The $625,500 cap on conforming loans in California's high-price areas hasn't changed since 2008. The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> (FHFA), which determines loan limits, has indicated that it may raise the cap slightly this fall. Borrowers may find it easier to qualify for a conforming loan, and perhaps get a lower interest rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Look nearby. While coastal areas have exorbitant home prices, inland places, such as capital city Sacramento ($292,950 median home price) and college towns such as Merced ($199,280), aren't always so pricey, according to CAR data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the San Francisco Bay Area has some relative bargains being found by millennials willing to "push the edges" into transitional neighborhoods, Ms. Thompson says. The lowest Bay Area median home price is $360,690 in Solano County, about 90 minutes from San Francisco.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than half of <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>'s jumbo lending is originated and closed in California, and dollar volume from January through August 2015 was up 20% over a year ago, says Ann Thompson, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>'s regional sales executive for Northern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spring housing market in the Bay Area was “incredibly aggressive," and even in the slower summer, hot properties continued to sell with bidding wars pushing them above list price, says Maggie Visser, an agent with San Francisco-based <span class="companylink">Paragon Real Estate Group</span>. Inventory is tight for single-family homes because there is no land to build new ones, she adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents in San Francisco are notoriously high, driving young professionals—often in technology or biotechnology jobs—to want to buy instead, says Mathew Carson, a broker with San Francisco-based First Capital Group. The median monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment there was $3,530 in August, according to rental website Zumper. About 43% of <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>'s California jumbo loans in the first half of 2015 went to first-time home buyers, Ms. Thompson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest challenge for these borrowers isn't income, but having enough money for the 20% down payment, Mr. Carson says. Home buyers who come up short are left with the choice of buying a lower-priced home or paying a higher interest rate for a jumbo with a lower down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 40% of <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>'s borrowers in California opt for a jumbo that requires a 15% down payment on loan amounts up to $1 million, Ms. Thompson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are a few more tips:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Get preapproved. With cash competitors, sellers won't consider an offer from buyers who are borrowing unless a lender has guaranteed that they qualify for the loan amount, Ms. Visser, the real-estate agent, says. Be prepared to waive appraisal and home-inspection contingencies, too, she adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Await a new cap. The $625,500 cap on conforming loans in California's high-priced areas hasn't changed since 2008. The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> (FHFA), which determines loan limits, has indicated that it may raise the cap slightly this fall. Borrowers may find it easier to qualify for a conforming loan, and perhaps get a lower interest rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Look nearby. While coastal areas have exorbitant home prices, inland places, such as capital city Sacramento ($292,950 median home price) and college towns such as Merced ($199,280), aren't always so pricey, according to CAR data. Even the San Francisco Bay Area has some relative bargains being found by millennials willing to “push the edges" into transitional neighborhoods, Ms. Thompson says. The lowest Bay Area median home price is $360,690 in Solano County, about 90 minutes from San Francisco.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Rising home prices are starting to catch up with buyers and may be leading some to put off buying for a little longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales tumbled 4.8% in August to a 5.31 million seasonally adjusted annual rate, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday, the steepest month-to-month decline since January, when they fell 4.9%. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected August sales would drop 1.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.53 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behind the decline were particularly big drops in the West and the South, two areas where prices have risen particularly sharply. In the South, where the median home price is up 6% over a year ago, month-to-month sales fell 6.6%. And in the West, where the median price rose 7.1% over the year, sales were down 7.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Nationwide</span>, the median home price hit $228,700 in August, a 4.7% increase over a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes were down 5.3% in August while sales of condominiums and co-ops dropped 1.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said they weren't particularly troubled by the monthly decline, noting that year-over-year sales were up a robust 6.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Even with the decline, I believe we are comfortably set for the best home sales year in eight years," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun said a shortage of supply could be contributing to rising prices. The NAR estimates it would take 5.2 months to exhaust the existing inventory assuming a current sales pace, down from 5.6 months a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> economist Daniel Silver said he maintained “a relatively upbeat view on the housing market," based on low inventory levels and a decrease in foreclosure sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The August lull in existing home sales should prove short-lived because the fundamentals for housing remain highly supportive," wrote <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> economists Joseph LaVorgna, Brett Ryan and Aditya Bhave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory Daco, head of U.S. macroeconomics at Oxford Economics dismissed the August number as a “hiccup" in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Rising employment, slowly accelerating wage growth, rising housing demand, slowing home price inflation and mortgage rates at historical lows will underpin greater housing demand and in turn sales through the remainder of the year and into 2016," he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing has been a bright spot this summer, with measures of home builder confidence[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/home-builder-confidence-rises-1442412330] and applications for building permits rising more than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">August housing starts, on the other hand, fell 3% from the previous month but analysts attributed the drop to the end of an affordable housing tax credit in New York rather than weakness in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s decision last week to hold rates steady at near-zero levels could give the housing industryan added boost[http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/moneybeat/2015/09/17/who-wins-and-who-loses-when-rates-rise/]in the coming months. Even when the central bank decides to raise rates, expected before the end of the year, the effect on mortgage rates and home sales will likely be modest, said Mr. Yun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are not too concerned, even in a rising interest rate environment because there are many compensation factors," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Continued job growth and an easing of mortgage underwriting standards could attract more potential buyers into the housing market, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 3.91% in August and Mr. Yun said he expected it to rise to 4.1% by the end of the year and to 5.0% by the end of next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales for July were revised down slightly to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.58 million from 5.59 million.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builder <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. posted double-digit percentage gains in new orders, deliveries and net income for its fiscal third quarter, underscoring a sustained but unspectacular recovery in the U.S. new-home market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar Chief Executive Stuart Miller described the market as improving in a "slow and steady manner" in <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>'s quarter ended Aug. 31, echoing what the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s monetary policy-setting arm said in its statement last week. Miami-based <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>, the second-largest U.S. home builder by houses constructed, behind <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>., posted a 10% increase in orders from a year earlier, a 16% increase in deliveries of completed homes and a 5% increase in average price, to $350,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have believed and continue to believe that the downside in the housing market is very limited and the upside very significant," Mr. Miller said Monday in a conference call with investors to discuss <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>'s results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller outlined several points that bode well for a U.S. home-construction market that, though it is rebounding, remains at roughly half of its average annual output in the latest normal housing market of 2001 to 2003 due to weak demand for starter homes so far in the recovery and shortages of construction labor and buildable land. Construction starts on single-family homes in the U.S. in this year's first eight months are up a lukewarm 11% from the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, Mr. Miller noted that, though mortgage-qualification standards remain prohibitive for many borrowers, the share of <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>'s sales going to first-time buyers rose to 30% in its third quarter from 25% a year earlier. That dovetails with a report by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> on Monday that 32% of sales of existing homes in August went to first-time buyers, up from 29% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> remains bullish on its rental-apartment business, which has 28 projects totaling 7,700 units under development with partners. "There is very, very large pent-up demand both in rental and in for-sale (housing) for buyers who need to come back in," Mr. Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>'s gains in orders and closings, and a 24% increase in revenue to $2.5 billion, the builder's gross margins slipped to 24.1% from 25.2% a year earlier. That was due mostly to higher land costs, which surged 56% from last year's quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts were expecting a steeper decline in margin, but the surge in closings and incentives that were little changed from a year earlier were behind the gross-margin beat, said Jay McCanless, an analyst at Sterne Agee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the quarter, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> reported a profit of $223 million, or 96 cents a share, up from $177.8 million, or 78 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts projected 80 cents in per-share profit and $2.42 billion in sales, according to Thomson Reuters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller also provided an update on <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>'s nascent efforts to build communities of single-family homes for rent. The builder earlier this year started its first such project of 80 homes near Reno, Nev. <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> now "expects to expand on that platform" due to the "very successful" early results from the Reno project, Mr. Miller said. He didn't provide additional details on the call.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chicago Mayor Plans</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue-Raising Steps</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel was set to release a plan Monday that was expected to confront a growing fiscal crisis in the third-largest U.S. city through a hefty property-tax increase and expanded fees on such services as trash collection and taxi rides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposal comes as the city faces a $426 million shortfall fueled by a sharp rise in pension costs. Details of his budget proposal have been leaking in recent weeks, with aldermen expecting a proposed property-tax increase of $500 million and an expansion of various fees and taxes. A spokesman for the mayor said details of his proposed budget were scheduled for release Monday, ahead of Mr. Emanuel's address to the City Council on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Emanuel had worked to reach agreements with city workers on looming pension payments that are coming due after years of shortchanging the retirement funds. But months into his second term, such deals haven't come to fruition, hobbled most recently by a court decision blocking changes to already agreed upon pension benefits.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates Not Driving Home Sales</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There has never been a better time to buy a home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While impossible to disprove without the benefit of hindsight, it is safe to say the slogan's prominent use at the peak of the housing boom was unfortunate.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There has never been a better time to buy a home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That phrase, or variations on it, can be found in thousands of advertisements from real-estate agents[http://www.c21affiliated.com/Blog/Take_the_plunge_Now_is_the_Time_to_Buy_a_Home]and home builders[http://www.lennar.com/mylennar/resource-center/article/rent-vs-own]. While impossible to disprove without the benefit of hindsight, it is safe to say the slogan's prominent use at the peak of the housing boom was unfortunate. Maybe it was even used during the Lyndon Johnson administration, which was the last time the U.S. homeownership ratio was so low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With that in mind, it is worth asking whether the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s decision last week to keep interest rates near zero for a bit longer will give a fillip to home sales.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Home-building in the U.S. slipped in August, with declines in both single-family and apartment-building construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts fell 3%[http://www.census.gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf] from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.126 million last month, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected August housing starts to fall 2.5% to 1.18 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several economists noted that higher levels of multifamily starts in June and July were due to developers rushing to begin construction in New York before the expiration of an affordable housing tax credit, and said August's drop didn't signal weakness in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The multifamily data have been very noisy lately mainly because of a massive swing in the data for the Northeast related to a changing tax incentive. The data available for the third quarter to date are significantly below the second-quarter averages because of effects of the tax change, but we think the underlying trends in the multifamily data remain solid," said <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> economist Daniel Silver in an analyst note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, new applications for building permits, a bellwether for forthcoming construction, rose 3.5% to 1.17 million, from a revised July rate of 1.13 million. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected 1.15 million building permits to be issued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits for single-family homes rose to 699,000, the highest since Jan. 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Single-family permits—the most important, and most stable—number in the whole report, have now recovered from their winter drop and are now trending higher," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts on single-family homes, which account for nearly two-thirds of the market, fell to 739,000. Multifamily units, which include apartments and condominiums, fell to 387,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-construction figures are volatile and often revised. Thursday's report showed new-home starts revised down to 1.161 million in July, compared with an initial estimate of 1.206 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, developers of multifamily projects, namely rental apartments, are finding ample capital available to finance their projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're seeing a lot of starts because the money spigot is wide open," said Carl Dranoff, whose <span class="companylink">Dranoff Properties Inc</span>. is developing five upscale apartment and condominium projects totaling 600 units in the Philadelphia and Newark, N.J., markets. “I don't know that demand is going to keep up with the supply."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction levels for new homes remain low by historical standards. Demand for homes for purchase remains strong, supported by low interest rates and the growing cost of rent in many areas. Despite this month's slip, housing starts were 16.6% higher in August than a year ago, and permits were up 12.5% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically low interest rates and rising rents have made a home purchase more appealing for those who can afford a down payment, but housing prices have also risen in much of the country. Although job growth has been steady over the past five years, wages have stayed relatively flat, making it harder for people to save for a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The South bucked the downward trend in starts that hit the rest of the country. New home construction in the South rose to 590,000 in August, the highest level since late 2007 and 10.1% above the year-ago figure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saun Sullivan, chief executive of DSLD Homes, a closely held builder based in Denham Springs, La., reported starting construction of 189 homes in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama last month. That is up from 168 a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sullivan said DSLD is starting more homes later this year due to the spring's unusually wet weather across much of the south, which delayed many projects. Even so, DSLD's construction starts so far this year are 17% ahead of its pace at this time last year. But Mr. Sullivan doesn't foresee DSLD dramatically overshooting his original target of 2,000 home sales for this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think demand is there," Mr. Sullivan said. “Down here, we don't have people waiting in line at model homes, but we still have solid demand. Oil prices haven't had a dramatic effect yet, but they definitely will cause some headwinds in our area and Texas."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home builders continue to report a positive outlook, although some voice concerns about a lack of land and construction workers. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>' confidence index rose[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/home-builder-confidence-rises-1442412330] in September to its highest level since November 2005, to a reading of 62, the group said Wednesday. A reading above 50 means most builders generally hold a favorable view of the market for newly built, single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late August, the Commerce Department reported new-home sales in July rose by 5.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 507,000, after unexpectedly sinking in June. Sales of existing homes climbed to their precession pace in July, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported in August. The August existing-home sales figure will be released Sept. 21, and new-home sales data will be released Sept. 24.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Adam Bonislawski   </div><div>437 words</div><div>11 September 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can a looming election make it more difficult to sell your home? Yes -- particularly if the contest is close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a paper published last year in the British Journal of Political Science, Princeton economist Brandice Canes-Wrone and her co-author Jee-Kwang Park, an assistant professor at Nazarbayev University in Astana, Kazakhstan, used data from <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span> to look at housing sales during 73 U.S. gubernatorial elections in 35 states from 1999 to 2006. They found that in election years, homes sales declined between two-tenths and three-tenths of a percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That might seem small, but the impact, they note, is comparable to "that of other, well-established influences on housing markets" such as a standard deviation decrease in per capita income growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The likely cause, says Dr. Canes-Wrone, is uncertainty, the notion being that house hunters are more reluctant to buy if they're unsure how a coming election will affect their financial fortunes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bolstering this contention, she observes, is the fact that the study found the election effect was especially pronounced in the case of competitive races. In elections where the winner received less than 55% of the vote, home sales fell by between a third and a half of a percentage point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The closeness of the election matters a great deal," she says. "There is this average electoral effect, but really it's being driven by these tight elections."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate analysis from 2012, real-estate site Movoto uncovered a similar effect using data from the California Realtors Association to look at presidential elections. During election years, the analysis found, home prices rose by just 4.5%, while they rose by 6% and 5.3%, respectively, in the years before and after an election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drs. Canes-Wrone and Park likewise detected a slight price decrease in election years, but Dr. Canes-Wrone says she considers that finding less solid given the difficulty of determining whether the drop is due to demand-side effects (like buyer uncertainty) or increased supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a survey of consumers the researchers conducted during the 2008 election, they did find the contest was weighing on the minds of would-be buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We found a link between the extent to which an individual believed the election would affect them personally and the likelihood of them delaying a house purchase until after the election," Dr. Canes-Wrone says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Summer is over, but luxury real-estate brokers are still sweating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wild swings in the U.S. stock market over the past few weeks have prompted many high-end home buyers across the country to rethink selling off assets to finance down payments, leading to canceled purchases, delayed closings and requests for price reductions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the unstable equities markets have made real estate more attractive to global investors who see the U.S. as a haven in the face of economic and political unrest overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid the financial uncertainty is speculation that the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> will raise interest rates before the end of the year, increasing the cost of mortgage borrowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's been a stressful few weeks. The moment the U.S. stock market has one little blip, everyone says, 'Oh, my god, the world is falling apart,'" says Ryan Serhant, a broker with high-end agency <span class="companylink">Nest Seekers International</span> in New York. Mr. Serhant reports his firm lost about six buyers in the $5 million range because of the current economic turbulence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month the <span class="companylink">S&amp;P 500</span> fell 6.26%, according to FactSet. For historical perspective, economists at home-listings website Realtor.com looked at two of the most recent periods -- in October of 2008 and August of 2011 -- in which the <span class="companylink">S&amp;P 500</span> posted losses over 10% to see the effect on high-end real estate. In 2008, prices of luxury homes, defined as the top 5% of the local market, declined 13.9% six months after the October drop. In 2011, luxury prices were only down 0.8% six months after the August drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Jonathan Smoke, chief economist for Realtor.com, current economic conditions are more similar to what happened in 2011 than in 2008, when the U.S. was in full-blown recession mode. As a result, luxury real estate will "be in a better position for recovery following the correction," he says. (<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, which owns The Wall Street Journal, also owns Realtor.com, the listing website of the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the short-term, however, the decline in stock portfolios may cut into some buyers' funding: In 2014, 21% of buyers used the proceeds of a stock or bond sale or borrowed against their retirement accounts to finance a home purchase, according to NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And markets that had been boosted by heavy buying from Chinese investors could suffer, as huge declines in China's stock market and Beijing's tightened capital controls have made it more difficult and expensive to buy U.S. real estate, says Daren Blomquist, vice president of Irvine, Calif.-based real-estate analytics firm RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Gilbert, a Boston-based real-estate agent for Luxury Residential Group, says in the past month, he has lost about a fifth of his individual home-buying clients looking for condos in the $650,000 to $950,000 range. Those with occupations tied to financial markets were most likely to walk away, he adds. However, Mr. Gilbert has seen a pickup in interest in those same condos from investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Miami, <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span> luxury-sales senior director Mick Duchon says clients have become more sensitive to pricing, adding that people are slower to "pull the trigger" on deals now. But the jitters aren't at the same level as they were in 2008 or in 2011, in part because the high-end market has been so strong lately, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gloria Grimshaw, co-owner of Nantucket-based Jordan Real Estate, says a real-estate attorney on the island warned her some buyers had started holding off. Ms. Grimshaw told a seller that the volatility in the market made it strategically wise to accept an earlier offer that had been rejected in hopes of getting a higher price. The $2.2 million sale price was just 5% below the asking price, a "good offer -- and their only offer," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases the turmoil is a boon to banks and developers. Hoyt Gier, Head of Citi Private Bank's Seattle office, says uncertainty about interest rates has increased requests for lender financing. One Citi client recently changed his mind about paying cash for a multimillion-dollar property and instead got a mortgage, Mr. Gier said. In New York, several developers report a recent uptick of buyers at luxury buildings that are still under construction, as future owners want to lock in at current rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, many home buyers are taking a wait-and-see approach. In suburban Chicago, Chris Crawford, an agent with Village Sotheby's International Realty, says a surplus of homes in the $2 million to $5 million range in his area makes it easier for prospective buyers to wait out the stock-market fluctuations. "People don't want to jump off a cliff right now," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nelson Yong, a 30-year-old account director at Silk, a digital-marketing company in Seattle, has been considering a condo purchase. Last month, he attended a new seminar offered by Realogics Sotheby's International Realty intended, in part, to reassure buyers about the recent stock-market trends. Mr. Yong said the presentation was helpful. But soaring real-estate prices in the city and memories of watching friends and family struggle to make mortgage payments in past downturns only fueled his reluctance to become a homeowner. "I don't feel like it's urgent to buy now," he says.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market dragged the economy into a deep recession nearly eight years ago. Could it now insulate the domestic expansion during a fragile period of global growth?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent numbers look promising, but several obstacles -- including shifts in where young households want to live, their capacity to take on debt and rising costs for home builders -- suggest the sector won't soon offer breakout growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the good news: New foreclosures have dropped to precrisis levels and sales of previously owned homes -- the bulk of the market -- have climbed to the pace of the early 2000s. Rising housing prices have made homeowners feel better about spending on their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem: Housing still isn't contributing much to overall economic growth because new construction of single-family homes, which packs an outsize economic punch, is stuck near levels of the early 1990s recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially, construction collapsed due to falling demand. Now, supply constraints have emerged as more people want to live in cities and construction costs have risen, while demand remains stubbornly weak at the entry level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The forces hindering home building matter a lot. New single-family homes give the economy a bigger boost than existing-home sales or the construction of new apartments. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> estimates that building a single-family home supports three full-time jobs for a year in construction and ancillary services. In comparison, it estimates that construction of a condo or apartment unit supports one full-time job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the past year, single-family construction added up to just 1% of gross domestic product, roughly half the contribution during the 1990s. Even though new-home sales are running more than 20% ahead of last year's pace, that pace is still well below almost every year of the 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contracted sales of newly built, single-family homes accounted for 16% of the annual unit volume of all single-family home sales in the 1990s, on average. Last year, that ratio was 9.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With homes for sale in short supply, price gains are outstripping income growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So if prices are rising, and resales thriving, why does home construction remain so weak?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, blame soft entry-level demand. New-home sales are more closely tied to household formation than existing home sales, which depend more on churn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Demand has been exceptionally low in aggregate because household-formation rates have been unusually low," said Brad Hunter, chief economist for construction research firm Metrostudy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While household formation is picking up, most of those new households are renters. The boost in rental households explains why the homeownership rate has fallen to a 48-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Households also need to qualify for a mortgage. Before the bust, builders relied on no-money-down programs to put new buyers into homes. Now, those programs are gone. Even though lending standards aren't as tight as commonly assumed, perceptions of tight credit can also dissuade would-be buyers from looking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, living preferences have shifted. In the past, builders put up entry-level homes in far-flung suburbs where land is cheaper, but many buyers today aren't willing to commute to get a better deal. Instead, many are opting for apartments closer to where they work and socialize, places that also happen to be more crowded and where land is more expensive. Home building is low because "the places where people want to live are not that buildable," said Hui Shan, an economist at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising supply bottlenecks magnify the demand problem if builders don't see a reason to reliably produce starter homes. <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>., which builds in 29 states, often must sell three to four move-up homes each month in a given community to meet its desired return on capital. To build less-expensive starter homes, that hurdle is six to eight sales a month, because profit margins are lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labor costs have increased because many construction workers left the industry after the bust. Ms. Shan ran an analysis on nationwide data that found just 54% of a sample of 637 construction workers from 2007 were still in the industry by 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even more daunting: Builders' largest raw material -- land -- shot up in price. To the extent there's a substantial gap between prices of new and existing homes, "that's land prices," said John Burns, who runs a builder consulting firm in Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, policy makers have focused on boosting demand by maintaining low interest rates and easing credit standards. Some industry analysts say other approaches will need to focus on supply bottlenecks by, for example, improving the permitting process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are on the cusp of a serious housing shortage," said Aaron Edelheit, an investor who earlier this year sold his company that had amassed some 2,500 rental homes in Atlanta beginning in 2009. "Everyone keeps focusing on rates or qualifying for loans. They need to pay attention to supply."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. construction spending rose to the highest level in more than seven years in July, suggesting that the housing market and business investment can help underpin economic growth amid turbulence outside American borders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total construction spending climbed 0.7% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.083 trillion, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, the highest level since May 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private building led the way, with both residential and nonresidential construction hitting new postrecession highs. State and local government spending dropped in July, but only after posting solid gains during the previous four months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The overall impression from the past few months is that the construction sector overall is the strongest part of the economy, with spending up at a remarkable 26% annualized rate in the three months to July," Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, construction spending data is volatile and often heavily revised. Low oil prices, meanwhile, may hinder investment in structures used to extract natural resources from the ground. But the overall construction trend has been building through the course of the year and the most recent updates were broadly positive for second-quarter growth. Actual spending during the first seven months of the year was up 9.3% from the same period in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest construction data stand in contrast to August manufacturing figures out Tuesday, which showed that sector expanding but at a slower pace. Other components of the economy have been broadly positive, with second-quarter growth revised to show a healthy rebound and early readings for the third quarter suggesting a degree of momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> revised its second-quarter gross domestic product growth estimate to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.8% from 3.7% after Tuesday's construction data. The bank is forecasting growth at a 2.2% pace in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the U.S. economy appears to be holding its own, growth in China and elsewhere appears to be on shakier ground. U.S. stocks fell early Tuesday following weak manufacturing data from the world's second-largest economy.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Derek Kravitz   </div><div>1177 words</div><div>29 August 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A16</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Change has come quickly, but not easily, to Dyker Heights, a fast-growing middle-class enclave in southwest Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its top-ranked schools are among New York City's most crowded, and complaints about illegally subdivided homes have soared as the neighborhood's population has grown over the past decade, residents and local officials say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known for its extravagant Christmastime displays on its attached row houses and redbrick Colonials, Dyker Heights has attracted an influx of affluent Asian professionals and families, leading to ballooning home prices, and tension between new residents and the area's older, largely Italian-American population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In some ways, it's not a very busy community. It's more laid-back and kind of sleepy," said Fran Vella-Marrone, president of the Dyker Heights Civic Association, who has lived in the neighborhood for almost three decades. "Traditionally, it's been a bedroom community, and around Christmastime everyone comes out for the lights. It's a national and international phenomenon. But that's changing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 2000 and 2011, Dyker Heights was the fastest-growing neighborhood in southern Brooklyn, according to city planning estimates. Most of the growth has been concentrated between 65th and 79th streets, from Fort Hamilton Parkway and 14th Avenue, Ms. Vella-Marrone said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that period, Dyker Heights's foreign-born population, mostly first- and second-generation Chinese, grew 35.5%, while some of the long-standing Italian-American families that spurred the area's post-World War II growth died out or moved away, according to city planners and the Brooklyn Chinese-American Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with its larger neighbors to the east and west, Dyker Heights is still relatively small, with just 55,000 residents spread over 1 1/2 square miles. It's also somewhat isolated, with only one subway line, the D, which runs through next-door Bensonhurst. The x28 express bus runs to Manhattan and takes about 45 minutes to reach Midtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But its hilly terrain and scenic views overlooking the ocean have made Dyker Heights an enviable and much-sought locale in this corner of Brooklyn. The median sales price of homes has risen quickly, from $822,500 in 2014 to $900,000 so far this year, according to data compiled by Janine Acquafredda of House N Key Realty, a local real-estate firm. "It's just gone nuts," said Sal Girgenti, owner of <span class="companylink">Ben Bay Realty</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median annual property-tax bill is $3,594, according to BlockShopper.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial property has followed suit. A four-story, mixed-use retail and apartment building on 81st Street sold for $8.9 million in March, setting a neighborhood commercial sales record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parks: The community is anchored by Dyker Beach Park and Golf Course, a 217-acre municipal park and 18-hole public course just below the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. It's one of the oldest golf courses in the city. The park, between 86th Street and the Belt Parkway, features tennis, handball and bocce courts. The CityParks Junior Golf Center, the first of its kind in the country, is open to youths 6 to 17 years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The smaller, 6-acre McKinley Park, between 73rd and 78th streets and Fort Hamilton Parkway, features several summertime programs for children: Readings in the Park, a free arts series, and Arts in the Park, a free reading series.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schools: Dyker Heights is in School District 20, which covers a broad swath of south Brooklyn, including Bay Ridge and parts of Bensonhurst, Borough Park and Sunset Park. Local schools include P.S.-I.S. 229, also known as Dyker, which offers prekindergarten to eighth grade; P.S. 127, also known as McKinley Park, which teaches kindergarten to fifth grade; and J.H.S. 201 and 259, Dyker Heights and William McKinley, respectively, each with 1,400 students in sixth to eighth grades. There are also several parochial schools and the private Poly Prep Country Day School.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2015, 42% of District 20 students in grades three through eight received a proficient score on the English Language Arts exam and 55% on the math exam, using the <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Education</span>'s default scoring levels, 3 and 4, according to state data released this month. Those scores are among the highest in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dining: Dyker Heights has a number of mom-and-pop bakery shops, including the Mona Lisa Bakery. For traditional Italian fare, locals have flocked to Tommaso Ristorante on 86th Street since it opened in 1974. Newer Chinese takeout and dim-sum restaurants, including the aptly named Wong Good Hand Pull Noodle, have cropped up on Eighth Avenue. East Harbor Seafood Palace, on the border between Dyker Heights and Sunset Park, was featured on the travel and food show "Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shopping: The main commercial thoroughfare is 13th Avenue, also referred to as Dyker Heights Boulevard, and features several long-running specialty food stores, including La Bella Marketplace with its collection of homemade cookies and soups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entertainment: The annual "Dyker Lights" Christmas celebration, with its sea of neon, 30-foot Santas and inflatable snowmen, draws thousands of visitors by foot, car and bus, and starts in earnest after Thanksgiving. For night life, locals tend to head to busier Bay Ridge, but residents recently celebrated the grand opening of the first Brooklyn branch of Pinot's Palette, which offers painting classes where the students can enjoy alcoholic beverages.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Rob Taylor in Sydney and Wei Gu in Hong Kong   </div><div>861 words</div><div>28 August 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Asia</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>22</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs are emerging that Chinese property investments abroad will maintain their torrid pace despite the market turmoil, as wealthy individuals and well-heeled companies seek to shelter their money in more stable havens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Australia, where China this year topped the U.S. as the biggest source of foreign real-estate investment, officials are worried that wealthy Chinese investors will pour more money into an already overheated Australian property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese investors are "looking for safe, stable, secure investments," Treasurer Joe Hockey said in an interview on Wednesday. "Australian real estate is very attractive for them in that regard," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's currency devaluation this month sparked a global selloff of stocks amid concern over the nation's economic health. After dropping by nearly a quarter over the previous five trading days, the Shanghai Composite Index rose 5.3% on Thursday. Any rise in Chinese investment would come despite the yuan's diminished buying power abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If wealthy Chinese feel that the recent devaluation is the beginning of a much longer and deeper depreciation, they may be motivated to move liquid assets overseas before that happens," said Andrew Taylor, co-CEO of Juwai.com, a Chinese website that helps people to search for overseas homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., where, as in Australia, Chinese buyers this year surpassed their nearest rivals to become the biggest foreign real-estate investors -- in this case above Canada -- at least one broker describes a sudden surge in Chinese interest in buying high-end residential properties in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have never seen demand be so strong for top-tier properties in Manhattan," said Carrie Chiang, associate real-estate broker at Corcoran, a U.S. real-estate company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Yuan devaluation will make Chinese clients think they should put some tangible asset in New York, because that's stable," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those expectations follow a tear in Chinese purchases abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the first half of 2015, Chinese investment in overseas commercial properties, which is a proxy for outbound residential investment, totaled $6.5 billion, well on track to surpass 2014's total of $10.5 billion, according to CBRE, a U.S.-based property-services firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise for U.S. properties was most pronounced, with the first half already exceeding the whole of 2014 by 68%, owing to a few large deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further, two Chinese life-insurance companies, <span class="companylink">China Life Insurance Group Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">Ping An Insurance</span> Group Co. of China, said in April that they would make their first equity investments in U.S. real estate, in an office and residential project in Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese investors are drawn to the U.S. for its stability, with low interest rates and moderate economic growth during a time of global economic uncertainty, according to Cushman Wakefield, a property consultant. Australia and the U.K. were the second- and third-most popular destinations for Chinese property investment, according to Cushman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you look at the Chinese investments in the U.S. this year, those companies have lowered their currency risk and diversified their holdings," said Michael Cole, a real-estate-market analyst at Mingtiandi.com, a website that tracks Chinese real-estate activities. "Those are very smart investments."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese foreign-property investments may get a further boost from Beijing's plan to loosen its capital controls with a new trial program in six cities allowing wealthy individuals to invest directly in overseas assets, including real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fresh surge into Australian property worries policy makers, who believe real-estate prices in big cities, such as Sydney and Melbourne, have in the past two years risen to levels that are pushing many middle-class families out of the market. Foreign buyers, including from China, are among those driving the boom, officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, Australia's foreign-investment review body said China had overtaken the U.S. as the country's biggest source of investment from overseas, with a total of 27.6 billion Australian dollars ($19.6 billion) last year. Residential and commercial real estate accounted for almost half of that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices in Sydney are 48% higher than they were at the start of the current growth cycle, in May 2012, and 32% higher in Melbourne, according to data from <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> RP Data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With soaring prices putting homeownership out of reach of many Australians, the government is under pressure to make housing more affordable. The bank regulator late last year adopted some measures to curb bank lending toward the purchase of investment property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hockey said officials were closely monitoring overseas interest since the turmoil of recent days on global stock markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government isn't concerned with overseas purchases of newly built property. However, officials believe many people, including from China and Southeast Asia, are abusing the system through loopholes to illegitimately buy existing homes and have recently began cracking down on them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Provided [the Chinese investment] goes into new real estate, creating the jobs in the construction industry that we want, that's welcome," Mr. Hockey said.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">In San Francisco’s Bidding Wars, Home Prices Go Ballistic; In the San Francisco Bay Area, selling a house is easy. The trick is getting $100,000 or more over the asking price</span>
</div><div class="author">By Candace Jackson   </div><div>1283 words</div><div>27 August 2015</div><div>09:45</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the San Francisco Bay Area's hot real-estate market, the question for many sellers isn't whether they'll get an offer. It's how much over the asking price the offer will be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's easy to sell," said Ken DeLeon, a real-estate agent based in Palo Alto. “The key is getting the extra $100,000."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in an extreme seller's market where bidding wars are common[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/bidding-wars-return-to-home-market-1437350840], upfront prep work and smart marketing are essential to getting top dollar for a property, homeowners and real-estate agents say. Sellers who invest $15,000 or more when listing their homes can recoup their costs many times over[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB10001424052702304840904577422084009663536].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several weeks before listing their 1,800-square-foot, loft-style condominium on Haight Street in San Francisco, Melanie and Adam Gensler spent $6,639 to repaint and recarpet the unit, $1,740 to repair and refinish the concrete floors and nearly $13,000 on staging—complete with contemporary paintings leased from local galleries through the <span class="companylink">San Francisco Museum of Modern Art</span>. The effort was coordinated by the couple's real-estate agents, Gregg Lynn and Alex Hachiya, of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Genslers—he's a financial and tax planner and she works in advertising sales—said they understood the need to freshen up and stage their condo before selling because they'd recently been house-hunting themselves. “For me the contrast has been pretty stark," said Mr. Gensler, whose home's interiors were handled by Mark Lopez at Guild Staging and Design. “Though I was surprised at the cost."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bay Area's latest market boom[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/tech-expansion-overruns-cities-in-californias-silicon-valley-1430156870]has been driven by an influx of high-paying tech jobs and, in some areas, overseas buyers looking for investment properties. A scarcity of listings is sending prices to new highs. In June, the number of new listings in San Francisco was down 23.1% from a year prior, according to the San Francisco Association of Realtors. The average listing spent 26 days on the market, compared with 31 days in June 2014. Median sales prices were up to $1.177 million—a 12.1% jump from a year ago. Real-estate agents say bidding wars are most common on properties priced below $2.5 million, and that buyers often make offers on numerous properties—anywhere from two to 20—before finally winning one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roh Habibi, a Bay Area real-estate agent who stars on Bravo's “Million Dollar Listing San Francisco," said he and a client, a 20-something <span class="companylink">Google</span> employee, made 12 offers before finally winning a bidding war on his 13th offer, a place in the Mission District that he purchased for $900,000—about $200,000 above asking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. DeLeon said low pricing can create an “auction dynamic" that draws high bids. After a 1,904-square-foot home in Menlo Park, listed for $1.895 million, was sold for $1.92 million, Mr. DeLeon listed a comparable home on the same street. He intentionally priced it low, at $1.498 million, which he said helped bring in 13 offers and a final sale price of $2.29 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Palo Alto, where the median sale price of a home is $2.667 million—up from $1.42 million four years ago, Mr. DeLeon said he experimented with extreme pricing, asking just $1 for a small condo he owned. “I knew I couldn't have a client take a chance on that," he said. It sold for $385,000, which he said was a record price for the complex at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Setting prices artificially low leads to some guesswork for buyers. Nora Dahr and Firas Azmeh have been looking for a four- or five-bedroom house for themselves and four children in Menlo Park, Palo Alto or Los Altos. The couple, who moved to the Bay Area from Texas for Mr. Azmeh's job at a mobile-security company, have put in seven offers and increased their budget from $2.5 million to just under $3 million with a large cash down payment and no contingencies. “The challenge now is that sellers aren't even willing to accept asking price these days," she said. “You're almost bidding blindly as to what they want, which encourages you to come in way above ask."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lynn said underpricing can drive traffic and create momentum, but he has also seen it backfire. “Sometimes Realtors end up with egg on their faces" if a home gets no offers or only one low offer, he said. “It's basically like you're a Hollywood producer and you didn't do well at the box office." Other agents say if a home receives no offers, they'll take the counterintuitive step of raising the price, as a way to indicate to buyers the price they're willing to accept.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, the Genslers priced their Haight Street loft at $1.55 million—the higher end of the expected price range. Mr. Gensler said he'd be happy with any offers above $1.6 million. Ms. Gensler said she hoped it would sell for much higher, though she said “the most important thing is that we sell it, so we could just focus on our family." The couple purchased the condo in 2006 for under $1 million and spent nearly $150,000 on improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents say the right price tag and attractive staging are key to prompting the kind of quick decisions that spark a bidding war. Mr. Lynn and Mr. Hachiya, like many Bay Area agents, also encourage sellers to get a thorough pre-sale inspection report, which for the Genslers' loft cost $500. (Typically, buyers pay for this during the closing process.) A satisfactory pre-inspection report makes potential buyers more willing to put in offers that aren't contingent on a home inspection. Buyers willing to waive the contingency on bank financing are also more attractive to sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few days before the brokers' open house at the Gensler home, the listing got picked on Curbed, a popular real-estate blog, which gave the home “two thumbs up" and described it as “a tad underpriced." Mr. Lynn and Mr. Hachiya held three open houses, one for agents on a Tuesday and two for buyers the following Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three days after the Sunday open house, the Genslers received two offers, one for $1.57 million and another for $1.62 million with a large down payment, no inspection or loan contingencies, a 21-day closing window and a four-paragraph personal letter with a photo of the buyers, a young couple relocating from Seattle. They accepted the higher offer, which was $70,000 over their asking price. The home went into contract nine days after it was listed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lynn said he thinks the property might have gotten even more offers if it had listed in the spring or the fall, peak selling seasons in San Francisco, but that the highest offer was strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gensler said he hoped for a higher offer, but was happy with the three-week closing and no contingencies. “In the end, we got pretty much what my conservative working number was," he said. Plus, they can now focus on enjoying their new place in the Oakland Hills. They paid $1.75 million for it in a bidding war, offering about 17% over the asking price.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kate Davidson   </div><div>602 words</div><div>27 August 2015</div><div>10:54</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—A forward-looking gauge of U.S. home sales edged up slightly in July after falling the previous month, suggesting the surge in momentum in the first half of the year could be leveling off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday its pending home sales index, which is based on signings for purchases of previously owned homes, rose 0.5% to a seasonally-adjusted 110.9 in July, from an upwardly revised reading of 110.4 in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 1% rise in July. Home sales typically close within a couple of months after signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are inclined to interpret the softness at the start of the quarter as payback after a strong performance at the beginning of 2015 and expect the housing market to remain in recovery mode," <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> economist Blerina Uruci said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales also remained well above year-ago levels. The index rose 7.4% in July from a year earlier, the 11th consecutive annual increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Led by a solid gain in the Northeast, contract activity in most of the country held steady last month, which bodes well for existing-sales to maintain their recent elevated pace to close out the summer," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors' group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Yun also warned that “available listings in affordable price ranges remain elusive for some buyers trying to reach the market and are likely holding back sales from being more robust."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also owns <span class="companylink">Move Inc</span>., which operates a website and mobile products for the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other recent data point to a healthy pickup in activity in the housing market this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of completed existing-home sales increased 2% last month from June, the strongest since February 200, NAR said last week. Sales of new homes in July were 21% higher than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-building also increased last month, thanks to a surge in construction of single-family homes, according to data from the Commerce Department. Builder sentiment is the highest it has been in a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stronger job gains have also helped build momentum in the housing market, and interest rates remain at historic lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 4.05% in July, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, but was back down to 3.84% last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's report suggests the big housing gains of the past few months could be over, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But we see no reason to expect an extended decline," Mr. Shepherdson said. “Mortgage applications are steady and could even rise over the next couple of months, thanks to the latest drop in rates; employment growth is robust and credit conditions are gradually easing. The existing homes market looks to us to be in pretty good shape."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent stock market volatility could cause some buyers to delay buying a home out of an abundance of caution, Mr. Yun said, but overall the prospects for continued strength in the housing market “remain intact for now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The readings were mixed across regions. According to Thursday's report, pending home sales rose 4% in the Northeast and 0.6% in the South. They fell by 1.4% in the West, and were unchanged in the Midwest.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A firming housing market and growing consumer confidence, alongside nearly five years of steady job creation, suggest the U.S. is resilient enough to weather the forces roiling stock prices and hurting commodity-producing countries reliant on China as an export market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instability in China and concerns about a <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> rate increase in coming months have caused turbulence in U.S. and other markets recently. But the turmoil doesn't mesh with the domestic economy's fundamentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumer confidence rose in August to its highest level since January, reflecting optimism about an improving labor market. New-home sales picked up the pace in July, rising 21% from a year earlier. Home builder sentiment is at its highest level since November 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is hard to make the case that the stock-market mess has anything to do with the U.S. economy as the data are all pointing to solid growth," said Joel Naroff, chief economist of Naroff Economic Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Mattamy Group Corp</span>., which is based in Canada and builds homes in five American states, sold 155 houses in the U.S. in July, nearly doubling its year-earlier output of 80. Its U.S. homes sell for $300,000 on average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's sunshine and blue skies, notwithstanding what's happening on Wall Street," said Brian Johnston, Mattamy's chief operating officer. "There's a lot of headline news going on in places like China, but the U.S. is a more internally focused economy than others in this world."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes are still about a third of their July 2005 peak of 1.4 million, and are still significantly below precrisis levels. But economists note that the market could strengthen as rental prices have climbed in major cities and potential buyers are eager to lock in mortgages before interest rates rise, which would make mortgages more expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers in the U.S. also are more upbeat. The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>, a private research group, said Tuesday that its index of consumer confidence rose to 101.5 in August, bouncing back after a steep decline in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Slowly accelerating wage growth and rising employment should drive a solid advance of household spending in the latter half of 2015," said Gregory Daco, an economist at Oxford Economics. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic output.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some economists warned that China's slowdown and Wall Street loses could weigh on confidence in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tracy Tannascoli, a Re/Max real-estate agent, said her higher-end clients already are feeling the pinch in Denver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With the high-end buyers, what's going on in the stock market and the global economy matters more to them," she said. "The slowdown does make it easier for first-time buyers, but those buyers are still very price-wary."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ana Campoy   </div><div>860 words</div><div>26 August 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AUSTIN, Texas -- This city's official motto is "Live Music Capital of the World." But as Austin experiences a tech-fueled economic boom that has driven up living costs, civic leaders are stepping in to help keep the tunes playing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Austin region, one of the fastest-growing metro areas in the country with a population of 1.9 million, has added more than 165,000 jobs over the past five years and boasted the lowest unemployment rate, 3.3%, among big U.S. metro areas in June. But with prosperity has come what Ryan Robinson, the city's demographer, refers to as "collapsing affordability." Median home prices in June reached $272,250, up more than 30% from 2010, according to the <span class="companylink">Austin Board of Realtors</span>. Rents jumped by 23% since the end of 2009, real-estate data firm Reis says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most public and private leaders are realizing that, to retain its identity as an enclave of cool and keep luring talented professionals from places such as California, the Texas capital needs to assist musicians and club owners strapped by higher costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Black Fret, a nonprofit started by tech executives, is raising money to provide grants to musicians so they can further their careers. So far it has handed out $130,000 in living stipends for artists to create and perform new music.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The music division of Austin's economic development department is offering professional seminars to help musicians find new ways to make money, and helping the nonprofit and private sectors on projects such as Mosaic Sound Collective, a one-stop shop for musicians that will have a music venue, recording studios, video production facilities, and eventually affordable housing for artists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is also studying longer-term policies to boost the local music industry, including hooking up sound artists with more profitable areas of the business, such as film and videogame production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're going to do some experimental things," said Kevin Johns, the department's director, who like many here has a musical background himself, playing bass guitar. "Clearly this demands putting out as many ideas as possible."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Redman, the developer of Mosaic Sound Collective, expects the campus, which will include vinyl records manufacturing and screen printing facilities, to generate 100 steady jobs for musicians. Mr. Redman, the father of two teenage boys in a band, said he and other collaborators are "passionate" about helping Austin live up to its motto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Musicians say something has to change for many of them to stay in Austin. A recent city survey of some 1,900 musicians found that more than 20% live below the poverty line and about half are eligible for publicly subsidized housing. A report accompanying the survey noted "fault lines developing that if left unchecked, may allow the erosion and disintegration of critical parts of the Austin music community."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can't pay your bills with cool," said Josh Logan, 32, frontman for local rock band the Blind Pets. He has decided to tour all of next year and live in his van after rent for his duplex jumped to $2,000 from $1,050.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among musicians' problems: Austin's cool vibe has attracted too many of them, creating a supply-demand problem. As Austin becomes a larger music market, more touring bands are also making it a stop. Those factors have kept pay stagnant, musicians say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the cost of doing business is going up, from higher rents for club owners, to more expensive parking, to the extra expense of rehearsal space for musicians who can no longer practice at home in newly gentrified neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeremy Murray, partner in the Blackheart, a bar in a Victorian home in the city's historic Rainey Street District, said that although recent transplants love live music, they don't necessarily like living next to it. As new apartment buildings have popped up around his club in the past couple of years, he has had to invest $50,000 in sound proofing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some bands, meanwhile, have begun adapting to the new economic reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Members of Casual Strangers, which plays a mixture of genres they dub "cosmic sludge," have full-time, if flexible, day jobs. Instead of loading into a bus to tour the country, they fly, spreading synthesizers and other equipment among their checked bags to avoid fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can do other jobs on the road," said Paul Waclawsky, the band's lead singer, a contract worker for a teacher-retirement system. "It's a new frontier."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eddie Wilson, a fixture on the Austin music scene since he started the now-defunct venue Armadillo World Headquarters in 1970, said rising property taxes are forcing him to find a new Austin location for one of his Threadgill's music-themed restaurants. But he is confident that for the city, the show will always go on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Music still causes a certain twitching in the buttocks that's self-perpetuating," Mr. Wilson said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto   </div><div>531 words</div><div>25 August 2015</div><div>09:02</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home price growth remained largely flat in June, according to a report released Tuesday, a further indication that the housing market is holding steady after years of turbulence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, covering the entire nation, rose 4.5% in the 12 months ended in June, slightly greater than a 4.4% increase in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-city index saw a slightly lower gain of 4.6% from a year earlier, compared with a 4.7% increase in May. The 20-city index gained 5% year-over-year, compared with a 4.9% increase in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a 5% increase to the 20-city index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month's Case-Shiller numbers are being closely watched after Monday's stock market plunge has some investors eyeing real estate as a more stable investment. Another important indicator, sales of new homes in July, is also set to be released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But economists cautioned that the report reflects the state of the housing market a couple of months ago. It doesn't take into account whether there will be any impact from the latest market news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you're uncertain about the economy you're not going to take your money and buy a house," said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research. “It's just a question mark that we didn't have before."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the Index Committee at <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span> Dow Jones Indices, pointed to a major stock market drop as one potential factor that could cool off the housing market in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A stock market correction is unlikely to do much damage to the housing market," he said. “A full-blown bear market dropping more than 20% could present some difficulties for housing and other economic sectors."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-over-month home price gains were modest, according to the report. Not seasonally adjusted, the U.S. Index rose 1% from May to June. The 10-city and 20-city indexes saw a 0.9% and 1% change over the month respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After seasonal adjustment, the national index was up 0.1% and the 10- and 20-city composites were down 0.1% over the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hottest markets in the country continued to see huge price run-ups compared with the tepid increases around much of the country. Denver reported a 10.2% price increase over the year, San Francisco saw a 9.5% price increase, and Dallas showed an 8.2% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside of those top markets, economists say there is evidence that the housing market is cooling off, after prices have gained steam much more quickly than incomes. Rapid home price growth is largely good for existing homeowners but makes it difficult for younger buyers to enter the market for the first time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price gains have remained largely flat in 2015 at just over 4% nationally, after low double-digit gains in 2013.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anna Louie Sussman   </div><div>729 words</div><div>21 August 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes climbed in July to their prerecession pace, but low inventory and higher prices threaten to curtail those gains heading into the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose 2% last month from June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.59 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday. Last month's sales pace was the highest since February 2007 and 10.3% higher than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite relatively steady gains in home sales in the past year, thinning supply and high prices loom as headwinds that could slow the recovery. As well, mortgage rates could be poised to rise when the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> raises short-term interest rates, potentially as soon as next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total inventory fell 0.4% to 2.24 million existing homes available for sale at the end of July, 4.7% lower than a year ago. At the current pace of sales it would take 4.8 months to exhaust the supply of homes on the market, down from 5.6 months a year ago, the NAR said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Klinge, a real-estate agent in San Diego, said inventory is low in his area because residents are reluctant to move to another town or state. In prior years, high prices would encourage some people to sell and leave town, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said every new listing generates intense interest from buyers, such as a three-bedroom home he listed Saturday night at $579,000 for which he had already received 30 queries by Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have to recognize that we have a broad-based housing shortage," said Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist. "Home builders have been essentially out of the game or underproducing" since the crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for a previously owned home slipped slightly to $234,000 from June's $236,300, but is still 5.6% higher than a year earlier. July's prices mark the 41st straight month of year-over-year price gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This combination of rising prices and thin supply has left some prospective buyers on the sidelines, especially as rising rents eat up a larger portion of incomes, making it harder to save for down payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun noted that first-time buyers declined to 28% of all buyers, the lowest share since January. Sales are being driven largely by buyers who already own homes, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to mortgage company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose in July to 4.05% from 3.98% in June. Mortgage rates are still low by historical standards, but could rise in the fall if the central bank raises interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market dynamics have also given an edge to existing homeowners, who can tap into rising home equity as their own properties appreciate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most of our business this year has been move-up buyers," said Steve Capen, an Atlanta-based agent with <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span>. "A lot of those people got trapped when the market crashed and they're finally starting to get some equity in the house so they can actually make move."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures this week on housing starts indicate that some new inventory will eventually make its way onto the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts of new homes rose 0.2% in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.21 million, the highest since October 2007, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. That is the third time in four months the figures reached a new high since the recession began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's existing-home report showed that July's gains were driven by sales in the single-family segment, which rose by 2.7%. Condo and co-op sales fell by 3.1%, the NAR said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales performance also differed by region. Home sales rose in the South and West, but fell in the Northeast and stayed flat in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Selma Hepp, chief economist at real-estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, said the regional differences in labor markets have contributed to divergent housing market performance. "Western states, such as California, have generally been the epicenter of both housing activity and job growth over the past year thanks to the job growth in higher-wage sectors, such as technology, health care and finance," she said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anya Martin   </div><div>757 words</div><div>21 August 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of real estate, the winter of 2014-15 may be the best thing that ever happened . . . to Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sunshine State is No. 2, behind California, in jumbo volume for both primary and secondary homes at Quicken Loans, says Bill Banfield, vice president at Quicken, one of the country's largest jumbo lenders. "When you have got people who get cold in the wintertime, they start thinking about places they would rather be. And that places Florida at the top of the list," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, sales of single-family homes were up 19.6% and condo sales 14.6% in Florida compared with a year ago, according to Florida Realtors, the state's largest trade association for residential real-estate professionals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home-sale price for single-family homes in Florida is $203,500, well under the $417,000 limit for government-backed loans in all but two counties in the state. Driving jumbo lending are markets like Miami Beach, where conforming loans are capped at $417,000 but the median sale price of a bayfront home is $2.7 million and waterfront estates can reach $40 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Home Mortgage</span>, the top metro area in Florida for jumbo lending is Naples-Marco Island, located in Collier County, where the conforming loan limit is $425,000. (The only other county that exceeds the $417,000 limit is Monroe County in the Florida Keys, where conforming loans are capped at $529,000.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Florida metro areas with high jumbo volume include Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach area (median sales price $295,000), North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota ($245,000), Cape Coral-Fort Myers ($212,250) and Jacksonville ($212,000), says Andre Brooks, Florida regional sales manager for <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Home Mortgage</span>, which holds the largest volume of jumbo mortgages in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders say that many borrowers in Florida are retirees moving south or out-of-state residents buying vacation homes. But another big demographic is self-employed entrepreneurs, says Tom Wind, executive vice president of home lending at Jacksonville, Fla.-based EverBank. Small-business owners like the fact that Florida has no state income tax and a business-friendly environment, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EverBank also does most of its Florida jumbo lending in the south and southwest coastal regions, with the majority of loans in the $800,000 to $1 million range, Mr. Wind says. "We see a lot of people coming from the Northeast to the east side of Florida, and from the Midwest to the West Coast," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign buyers, mostly from France and South America, are also big in the Miami area, where more than half of sales this summer have been cash transactions, says Ines Hegedus-Garcia, an agent with Miami-based RelatedISG International Realty. In hot areas like Miami Beach, home buyers should be prepared for bidding wars and final sale prices above listing prices, she adds. In competitive markets, borrowers are sometimes losing out to cash buyers even when they bid higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are a few more tips for Florida jumbo borrowers:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher down payments. While jumbo mortgages typically require a 20% down payment, some Miami sellers will also make that mandatory even when the buyer's lender has looser requirements, Ms. Hegedus-Garcia says. "The seller wants to see a stronger buyer," she adds. Many Florida borrowers put down even more, 30% or 40%, on homes in the $1 million range, Mr. Banfield says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash now, finance later. One way that jumbo borrowers compete with cash buyers is to purchase with cash and then refinance a few months later, Mr. Brooks says. Roughly half of Quicken's Florida jumbos are refinances, Mr. Banfield says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider an ARM. About 40% of <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>'s jumbo mortgages in Florida are adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) compared with only 10% of the general mortgage population, Mr. Brooks says. Quicken also sees a lot of ARM borrowers who aren't quite at retirement but want to buy a second home. They get a jumbo with low rates for the initial five years, for example, then use the proceeds from the eventual sale of their primary home to pay off the ARM before higher rates kick in, Mr. Banfield says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathon Fischer, 52, and his wife Christine Avanti-Fischer, 44, have owned properties in Miami, Los Angeles, New York City and the Muskoka region of Canada. Their latest acquisition is in a destination where they can vacation in style and, they hope, see a return on their investment: Los Cabos, Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last May, they bought a four-bedroom, roughly 4,000-square-foot house in the Villas del Mar resort for $1.85 million. The couple is now spending between $1.5 million and $2 million to add about 1,000 square feet and "renovate every square inch to make it modern," said Mr. Fischer, a venture-capital investor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What intrigued us about the peninsula was that they had this concentration of really nice resorts and hotels and a surprising amount of activities in a small area," Mr. Fischer said. Created about 20 years ago, Villas del Mar has a golf course, 16 miles of walking paths and property managers who pay owners' bills and grocery shop for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of the U.S. housing crash and press about Mexico's crime problems, Los Cabos saw transactions freeze, prices drop and construction stall. Real-estate brokerages fled the market altogether. Last September, Hurricane Odile closed the area's luxury hotels for most of the tourist season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But today, the recovery in U.S. luxury-home prices, particularly in California, is driving a post-hurricane revival in Los Cabos. A change in government and subsequent reduction in drug-related homicide helped reduce fears about violence in Mexico overall; Los Cabos has remained a relatively safe and low-crime area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers of some of the world's most luxurious resorts are moving in, while resort concepts that have been stalled for years are back to building. Sales reported to multiple listing services were up 18% in 2014 compared with the year prior, despite the hurricane, said Carol Billups, owner of Cabo Realty Pros.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Cabos, also known simply as Cabo, lies at the southern tip of Mexico's Baja California peninsula. It consists of two towns -- Cabo San Lucas to the west and San Jose del Cabo to the east -- and a 20-mile corridor between them, where most of the beaches, resorts and high-end residential developments are. Until the 1980s, the area was mainly undeveloped desert and fishing villages. Then, drawn by sport fishing, golf and nearly year-round sunshine, U.S. and Canadian visitors helped build the area's current tourist-oriented economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices at the top end are $1,300 to $1,400 a square foot -- 30% to 40% higher than during the crash years of 2009 and 2010, said Chris Snell, a veteran real-estate agent in the area. These figures include prime land costs and top-end construction of "air-conditioned space" (excluding terraces and patios). During the peak years from 2004 to 2007, top-end prices were a bit higher, at about $1,400 to $1,500 a square foot, Mr. Snell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Billups said that before the bust, her average sale was a $2 million property, but that transactions stalled so badly she revamped her company to serve retirees buying $300,000 to $500,000 homes. This fall, she will begin aiming for the luxury vacation market again, she said. <span class="companylink">Christie's International Real Estate</span> discontinued its relationship with a Christie's affiliate in Los Cabos five years ago, but is currently searching for a new partner in the area, said Senior Vice President Zackary Wright.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ohana Real Estate Investors, the group behind Hanalei Plantation Resort in Hawaii and the Montage Beverly Hills, began selling properties at its new resort, Maravilla, last year. The community includes family-friendly amenities such as a two-story climbing wall, an 18-hole putting course and a kids' activity center that will include educational programming on the local habitat and history. Empty oceanfront lots cost between $5 million and $10 million. Condos and townhouses, the first of which were completed last year, also cost between $5 million and $10 million, said Director of Residential Real Estate Neil Johnson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales have been brisk, said Mr. Johnson, despite the fact that Maravilla has thus far spent little money on marketing. Mr. Johnson said that instead of advertising, the company is taking a careful "word-of-mouth" approach to finding buyers, and will turn away those deemed unworthy. "We don't want to have anybody who is not a good person or has a questionable background or ethics," he said. "We don't want people snapping pictures of people out by the pool, or to point out specific units and say, 'that's where so and so lives.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chileno Bay Club, a 1,200-acre area with 2 miles of beachfront on Chileno Bay, where development has started and stopped for years, has already sold $50 million worth of property since launching a year ago, said Mr. Snell, a former brokerage owner who is now director of development for Chileno Bay Club.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Maravilla, Chileno Bay Club is eschewing a traditional Mexican look for modern lines and finishes. It will also have a kids' club with a burger restaurant and videogame room, two movie theaters, an 18-hole, Tom Fazio-designed, members-only golf course and a network of bike paths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modern design was a draw for Joel and Terry Ray from Dallas. The couple bought a four-bedroom house for $2.3 million in Villas del Mar two years ago, and spent an additional $300,000 to $500,000 to modernize the interior, Mr. Ray said. They now plan to list that property for about $3 million, after they build a five-bedroom house in Chileno Bay Club. They start construction this fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One of the things that attracted me was that we could custom-build our own home and we're right on the water," said Mr. Ray, 63, who owns a company that provides medical benefits. Mr. Ray said the fact that Chileno Bay Club houses have solar panels is also a big draw, because he can sell energy back to the grid when they are not in the home, reducing energy costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chileno Bay Club's beachfront lots have sold for $7 million to almost $9 million, while elevated lots are $7 million to $15 million, said David Michonski, executive vice president at Snell Real Estate, now an affiliate of Engel &amp; Volkers, a Germany-based international brokerage. Construction -- whether buyers use their own architect or ask the developer to build the house -- is additional, and costs roughly $500 a square foot, Mr. Michonski said. Chileno Point Villas, the type of oceanfront home the developer is building for the Rays, cost $6 million to $10 million for both the land and construction. Mr. Ray declined to say what he paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers and real-estate agents say that the typical buyers 10 to 20 years ago were retirement-age couples looking to get away from it all. Today, by contrast, there are more young families and more retirees who are catering to the needs of their children and grandchildren. "In the olden days it was two guys with a fishing cabin raising hell," said Mr. Snell. Today, "the profile of our buyer has become more family oriented."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're building more meeting places, a club house, places where people sit together, places to watch a movie together at night," said developer Mark Cooley of SV Capital, based in Englewood, Colo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That appealed to Fred Hearn, a property developer in Vacaville, Calif. Mr. Hearn, 61, and his wife Diane, 59, have been vacationing in Los Cabos for over 30 years, and own a condominium within walking distance to Cabo San Lucas, where "there's always a party," said Mr. Hearn. But in March, they put a deposit on a four-bedroom condo at VieVage. Mr. Hearn declined to say what he paid for the unit; Mr. Cooley said beachfront four-bedrooms are selling for about $3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We did it more to have the grandkids down and be in a safe environment for them," said Mr. Hearn. The fact that VieVage will be managed by Auberge Resorts Collection, a high-end resort company, was also a draw, added Mr. Hearn, who said he is familiar with Auberge from their resort in the California wine country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We got involved prior to having anything in the ground," said Mr. Hearn. "It was a leap of faith."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anna Louie Sussman   </div><div>776 words</div><div>20 August 2015</div><div>17:14</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of existing homes climbed in July to their prerecession pace, but low inventory and higher prices threaten to curtail those gains heading into the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose 2% last month from June to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.59 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday. Last month's sales pace was the highest since February 2007 and 10.3% higher than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite relatively steady gains in home sales in the past year, thinning supply and high prices loom as headwinds that could slow the recovery. As well, mortgage rates could be poised to rise when the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> raises short-term interest rates, potentially as soon as next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total housing inventory fell 0.4% at the end of July to 2.24 million existing homes available for sale, 4.7% lower than a year ago. At the current pace of sales it would take 4.8 months to exhaust the supply of homes on the market, down from 5.6 months a year ago, the NAR said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Klinge, a real-estate agent in San Diego, said inventory is low in his area because residents are reluctant to move to another town or state. In prior years, high prices would encourage some people to sell and leave town, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said every new listing generates intense interest from buyers, such as a three-bedroom home he listed Saturday night at $579,000 for which he had already received 30 queries by Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have to recognize that we have a broad-based housing shortage," said Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist. “Home builders have been essentially out of the game or underproducing" since the crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for a previously owned home slipped slightly to $234,000 from June's $236,300, but is still 5.6% higher than a year earlier. July's prices mark the 41st straight month of year-over-year price gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This combination of rising prices and thin supply has left some prospective buyers on the sidelines, especially as rising rents eat up a larger portion of incomes[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/rising-rents-outpace-wages-in-wide-swaths-of-the-u-s-1438117026], making it harder to save for a down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun noted that first-time buyers declined to 28% of all buyers, the lowest share since January. Sales are being driven largely by buyers who already own homes, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to mortgage company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose in July to 4.05% from 3.98% in June. Mortgage rates are still low by historical standards, but could rise in the fall if the central bank raises interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market dynamics have also given an edge to existing homeowners, who can tap into rising home equity as their own properties appreciate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Most of our business this year has been move-up buyers," said Steve Capen, an Atlanta, Georgia-based realtor with <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span>. “A lot of those people got trapped when the market crashed and they're finally starting to get some equity in the house so they can actually make move."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures this week on housing starts indicate that some new inventory will eventually make its way onto the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts rose 0.2% in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.21 million, the highest since October 2007, the Commerce Department said Tuesday[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/housing-starts-edge-up-0-2-1439901362]. That is the third time in four months the figures reached a new high since the recession began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's existing-home report showed that July's gains were driven by sales in the single-family segment, which rose by 2.7%. Condo and co-op sales fell by 3.1%, the NAR said. Prices in both categories rose, with single-family home prices jumping 5.8% and condo prices rising 3.2%. These prices are not seasonally adjusted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales performance also differed by region. Home sales rose in the South and West, but fell in the Northeast and stayed flat in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Selma Hepp, chief economist at real-estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, said the regional differences in labor markets have contributed to divergent housing market performance. “Western states, such as California, have generally been the epicenter of both housing activity and job growth over the past year thanks to the job growth in higher-wage sectors, such as technology, health care and finance," Ms. Sepp said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James Ramage   </div><div>468 words</div><div>20 August 2015</div><div>16:20</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar weakened broadly on Thursday as investors continued to push back expectations for higher U.S. interest rates one day after the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> signaled it was no closer to raising them at its September meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar sank 0.8% against the euro, as the common currency traded at $1.1210, on pace for its highest New York close against the buck since June 29. The U.S. currency slid 0.3% versus the yen to ¥123.45 in late-afternoon trade, heading for its weakest New York close in more than three weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a group of 16 commonly traded currencies, fell 0.3% to 88.35.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors sold dollars as they looked past solid U.S. numbers for weekly jobless claims[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-jobless-claims-rise-4-000-to-277-000-1440074093], existing home sales[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-rise-to-pre-recession-pace-1440079684] and a gauge for the mid-Atlantic manufacturing sector to focus instead on the latest signals from the Fed[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-july-policy-meeting-minutes-leave-mixed-markers-on-rates-1440006546], which pointed to a reduced likelihood of lifting its benchmark short-term interest rate at its meeting next month. Higher U.S. rates would attract yield-hungry investors to the greenback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minutes from the meeting of the Fed's policy-making body late last month, which were released Wednesday[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-july-policy-meeting-minutes-leave-mixed-markers-on-rates-1440006546], underscored how U.S. inflation would fall below the central bank's 2% target through 2017 and move up only gradually thereafter, as falling crude-oil prices would continue to weigh on consumer energy costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's pretty clear the Fed will not be ready to raise rates in four week's time," said Lennon Sweeting, currency payments analyst at USForex, which helps U.S. corporations hedge their currency exposure. “There isn't confidence that inflation will reach the Fed's target anytime soon, so many investors have probably repositioned themselves, and are shying away from long-dollar bets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Open Market Committee next meets over two days on Sept. 16-17 to set monetary policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors also softened their timeline for the Fed and interest rates after China devalued its currency last week[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/china-moves-to-devalue-the-yuan-1439258401], a move that upended financial markets as it battered riskier assets, including emerging-market and commodity-linked currencies[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/emerging-market-currencies-struggle-as-analysts-warn-of-total-carnage-1440071008]. China's shift on the yuan also raised fears about the country's slowing economy and the global inflation picture, suggesting that investors were less likely to see tighter U.S. monetary policy amid such a darkening global backdrop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal-funds futures, which traders and investors use to bet on Fed policy, showed a 24% likelihood of a rate increase at the September meeting, compared with 45% on Wednesday and one week ago, according to data from the <span class="companylink">CME Group</span>.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anya Martin   </div><div>737 words</div><div>19 August 2015</div><div>10:53</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of real estate, the winter of 2014-15 may be the best thing that ever happened…to Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sunshine State is No. 2, behind California, in jumbo volume for both primary and secondary homes at Quicken Loans, says Bill Banfield, vice president at Quicken, one of the country's largest jumbo lenders. “When you have got people who get cold in the wintertime, they start thinking about places they would rather be. And that places Florida at the top of the list[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-florida-keys-sunshine-premium-1426176377]," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, sales of single-family homes were up 19.6% and condo sales 14.6% in Florida compared with a year ago, according to Florida Realtors, the state's largest trade association for residential real-estate professionals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home-sale price for single-family homes in Florida is $203,500, well under the $417,000 limit for government-backed loans in all but two counties in the state. Driving jumbo lending are markets like Miami Beach[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/miami-condos-seek-chinese-buyers-1435777452], where conforming loans are capped at $417,000 but the median sale price of a bayfront home is $2.7 million and waterfront estates can reach $40 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Home Mortgage</span>, the top metro area in Florida for jumbo lending is Naples-Marco Island, located in Collier County, where the conforming loan limit is $425,000. (The only other county that exceeds the $417,000 limit is Monroe County in the Florida Keys, where conforming loans are capped at $529,000.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Florida metro areas with high jumbo volume include Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach area (median sales price $295,000), North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota ($245,000), Cape Coral-Fort Myers ($212,250) and Jacksonville ($212,000), says Andre Brooks, Florida regional sales manager for <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Home Mortgage</span>, which holds the largest volume of jumbo mortgages in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders say that many borrowers in Florida are retirees moving south or out-of-state residents buying vacation homes. But another big demographic is self-employed entrepreneurs, says Tom Wind, executive vice president of home lending at Jacksonville, Fla.-based EverBank. Small-business owners like the fact that Florida has no state income tax and a business-friendly environment, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EverBank also does most of its Florida jumbo lending in the south and southwest coastal regions, with the majority of loans in the $800,000 to$1 million range, Mr. Wind says. “We see a lot of people coming from the Northeast to the east side of Florida, and from the Midwest to the West Coast," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign buyers, mostly from France and South America, are also big in the Miami area, where more than half of sales this summer have been cash transactions, says Ines Hegedus-Garcia, an agent with Miami-based RelatedISG International Realty. In hot areas like Miami Beach, home buyers should be prepared for bidding wars and final sale prices above listing prices, she adds. In competitive markets, borrowers are sometimes losing out to cash buyers even when they bid higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are a few more tips for Florida jumbo borrowers:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher down payments. While jumbo mortgages typically require a 20% down payment, some Miami sellers will also make that mandatory even when the buyer's lender has looser requirements, Ms. Hegedus-Garcia says. “The seller wants to see a stronger buyer," she adds. Many Florida borrowers put down even more, 30% or 40%, on homes in the $1 million range, Mr. Banfield says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash now, finance later. One way that jumbo borrowers compete with cash buyers is to purchase with cash and then refinance a few months later, Mr. Brooks says. Roughly half of Quicken's Florida jumbos are refinances, Mr. Banfield says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider an ARM. About 40% of <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>'s jumbo mortgages in Florida are adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) compared with only 10% of the general mortgage population, Mr. Brooks says. Quicken also sees a lot of ARM borrowers who aren't quite at retirement but want to buy a second home. They get a jumbo with low rates for the initial five years, for example, then use the proceeds from the eventual sale of their primary home to pay off the ARM before higher rates kick in, Mr. Banfield says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home construction is booming -- and laying a strong foundation for an interest-rate increase next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts in July hit their highest levels since October 2007, rising 0.2% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.21 million. Starts on single-family homes, which exclude apartments, were up 12.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changes in housing starts tend to predict the direction of the unemployment rate some 12 to 18 months later. Indeed, the connection is so strong and has held for so long that housing starts can be fairly said to be among the most powerful economic leading indicators available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason for this is that new home construction has spillover benefits for other industries, indirectly generating jobs: New homes need things like carpets. Even seemingly unrelated industries, such as legal services, tend to benefit from surges in construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> is one of the more obvious beneficiaries of a stronger housing market. Its second-quarter same-store U.S. sales rose 5.7%, year over year, in the second quarter, the company said on Tuesday. Purchases of big-ticket items were up even more sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong demand for homes could also mitigate some of the squeeze that rising interest rates will put on mortgage lending. Total originations have seen only minimal growth in 2015, thanks to tight credit standards and low levels of refinancing. An improving economy and rising employment could prompt looser standards for purchase mortgages and first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong rise in housing starts suggests labor market conditions could tighten considerably. And at 5.3%, unemployment is already now very close to the lower estimates of the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment. With July's new housing numbers implying even lower unemployment next year, Fed officials should expect inflationary pressures to start to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notably, though, there are few signs that housing itself is overheating. Starts are still below where they were for most of the 1990s, before the housing bubble. This suggests that they could keep rising, at least until they get closer to the annualized pace of 1.5 million new units that many economists consider "normal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if normality has yet to return, though, the latest figures are likely enough to persuade many at the Fed that there is no need to wait any longer to start raising rates.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home building ticked up in July thanks to a surge in construction of single-family homes, the latest sign of momentum in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts rose 0.2% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.21 million last month, the highest since October 2007, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts on single-family units, which exclude apartments and represent almost two-thirds of the market, jumped 12.8% to their highest level since December 2007. Multifamily units, including apartments and condominiums, fell 17%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New applications for building permits, a bellwether for construction in coming months, declined 16.3% to 1.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a lot going on in this set of numbers, but the bottom line is an explosively strong housing sector," Amherst Pierpont Securities Chief Economist Stephen Stanley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-construction figures are volatile and often revised. Tuesday's report showed new-home construction rose 12.3% in June from the prior month, against an initially reported 9.8% jump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pickup in June was driven entirely by construction of multifamily housing units. That was due in part to a surge in activity in New York City just before tax incentives for multifamily developments were set to expire. Thus, many economists expected new applications for permits would plunge in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction levels for new homes remain historically low, though there are continued signs of growing underlying demand. Starts were 10.1% higher in July than a year ago, and permits were up 7.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Construction activity is picking up across the country, which we take as positive signal about the health of the U.S. consumer and overall economy," <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> economist Jesse Hurwitz said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family construction generally provides a bigger boost to the economy. After Tuesday's report, <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> raised its forecast for third-quarter growth by 0.1 percentage point, to 2.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">David Weekley Homes</span>, a Houston-based builder that constructed roughly 3,000 homes in 12 states last year, starts in July were up 10% from a year earlier. That matches Weekley's year-to-date growth of 10% in comparison with this time last year. The pace was slower earlier this year, but it has picked up in the second quarter, Chief Executive John Johnson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think the economy continues to improve slightly, and consumer confidence is improving modestly," Mr. Johnson said. "But there still is, I think, a concern out there about the future of the economy and [rising] interest rates."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other recent data suggest the housing sector, which has plodded along during this expansion, is quickly gaining ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A forward-looking gauge of U.S. home purchases slipped in June, after hitting its highest level in more than nine years in May, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said last month. A separate report from the industry group showed sales of previously owned homes increased 3.2% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49 million, the strongest since February 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home builders also appear more optimistic. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>' confidence index rose to its highest level since November 2005, to a reading of 61 in August, the group said. A reading above 50 means most builders generally hold a favorable view of the market for newly built, single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gulf between builder sentiment, which has surged, and slowly rising single-family starts has grown since 2011. Tuesday's report suggests activity in the single-family sector could be catching up, though the figures have a margin of error of 9.8%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Min Zeng   </div><div>756 words</div><div>18 August 2015</div><div>15:47</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A solid housing report on Tuesday brightened the U.S. economic outlook, sapping demand for <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late-afternoon trading, the yield on the benchmark 10-year <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> note was 2.196%, compared with 2.15% on Monday. Yields rise as prices fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year note's yield, a bedrock for global finance, is trading near its lowest level since the end of April. Trading volume was lighter than usual amid the typical summer lull, which could exaggerate price moves, traders said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts hit the highest level since 2007[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/housing-starts-edge-up-0-2-1439901362], which came on the back of Monday's plunge in the manufacturing outlook in the New York region. The mixed releases add to investors' debate over whether the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> may start raising benchmark short-term interest rates next month. Higher interest rates by the Fed make newly-minted bonds more attractive for buyers, hurting the value of outstanding bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yields on some short-term government debt securities, known as T-bills, rose to the highest level in five years. These yields, highly sensitive to changes in the Fed's interest rate policy outlook, have been climbing over the past month as Fed officials suggested a rate increase could come during the Sept 16-17 policy meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on the one-year T-bill hit 0.39% during Tuesday's session, the highest intraday level since April 2010. It was 0.377% in late-afternoon trading. The yield on a six-month T-bill also touched the highest level since 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">T-bill yields remain paltry and many investors don't expect them to rise significantly given the Fed's go-slow approach in raising short-term interest rates. Yet even a slight uptick is welcome by investors who have been struggling to boost returns as the Fed has held the policy rate near zero since December 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are excited," said Kam Poon, portfolio manager specializing in short-term debt instruments at <span class="companylink">Aberdeen Asset Management</span>, which has $483.3 billion assets under management. “The relief is on its way. The past decade has been very challenging" for cash investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Sontag, a money manager in Chicago at <span class="companylink">Neuberger Berman Group LLC</span> which has $251 billion assets under management, said he doesn't expect a return to 5% levels of yield on T-bills--which occurred before the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In order to get that type of yields, you need to see 3% plus real economic growth and 2-3% inflation," he said. “We are not in that environment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> bond yields have continued to stay very low from a historical standpoint, suggesting robust demand for highly-liquid financial assets amid sluggish global economic growth, subdued inflation and highly accommodative monetary policy around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solid jobs growth has bolstered the case for the Fed to tighten policy next month for the first time since 2006. Yet many investors remain skeptical about whether the economy is strong enough for the Fed to act in September, with commodities weakening, and concerns have been growing over the pace of China's slowing economy. They are concerned that a premature tightening cycle could hurt the U.S. economic growth and contain inflation risks, which has made long-term bonds attractive to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are a number of things occurring in the markets which are signals of weakness" in the global economy that argue for the Fed to take it slow in raising rates, said Ted Ake, manager of fixed income at Willingdon Wealth Management, which has $180 million of assets under management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed-funds futures showed Tuesday that investors and traders see a 36% likelihood of a rate increase at the September meeting, compared with 45% on Monday, according to data from the <span class="companylink">CME Group</span>. The odds were 26% a month ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Schlanger, a money manager at <span class="companylink">Pioneer Investments</span> in Boston, which has more than $40 billion in assets under management, said the Fed could still tighten in September, but the global uncertainty bolstered the case that the central bank's tightening cycle would be shallow, which would prevent bond yields from rising significantly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year yield has fallen after hitting this year's intraday peak of 2.5% in June. The yield was 2.173% at the end of last year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar gains as July's pace of US housing starts topped expectations, showing the sector's strength continues to rebound. Housing reflects a source of wealth effect which, alongside confidence in the labor market, could spur consumer activity in the US and drive broad economic growth. The euro eases to $1.1037 from $1.1063 ahead of the numbers, putting the dollar up 0.4% for the session. It's now flat versus the yen at Y124.34; the greenback was at Y124.23 pre-data.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Treasury</span> prices pull back after a report pointed to improvement in the housing market. U.S. housing starts rose 0.2% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.21 million last month, the highest since October 2007. The bond market rallied Monday on a 14.9% drop in NY Fed's manufacturing index. The mixed economic reports have raised question over whether the Fed could raise rates in September.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A gauge of home-builder sentiment rose to its highest level since November 2005, reflecting growing confidence in a steadily improving U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index of builder confidence in the market for new single-family homes rose one point to a seasonally adjusted level of 61 in August, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said Monday. A reading over 50 means most builders generally see conditions as positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index has been positive for the past year, following five months in early 2014 when sentiment hovered in negative territory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The fact the builder confidence has been in the low 60s for three straight months shows that single-family housing is making slow but steady progress," said NAHB Chairman Tom Woods, a home builder from Blue Springs, Mo. He added that some home builders reported difficulty accessing land and labor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, sales of existing homes hit their strongest pace since February 2007, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said last month. Newly built single-family home sales fell in June by 6.8% to their lowest reading since November 2014, according to Commerce Department data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at the economic consultancy MFR Inc., observed that the index's level was similar to its level in early 2006, when single-family housing starts "were running at over a 1.5 [million] unit rate, or more than twice what they are now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So, there remains a big disconnect between what home builders are saying and what they are actually doing," he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index of builder sentiment began to diverge with single-family housing starts in 2011. The gulf between sentiment, which has skyrocketed, and slowly rising single-family housing starts, has only widened since then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The July existing-home sales figure will be released Aug. 20, and new-home sales data will be released Aug. 25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current-sales component of the index rose this month to 66 from 65 in July. Expectations for sales over the next six months stayed steady at 70. A measure of traffic from prospective buyers rose two points to 45.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are pushing commercial real-estate prices to record levels in cities around the world, fueling concerns that the global property market is overheating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The valuations of office buildings sold in London, Hong Kong, Osaka and Chicago hit record highs in the second quarter of this year, on a price per square foot basis, and reached post-2009 highs in New York, Los Angeles, Berlin and Sydney, according to industry tracker <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deal activity is soaring as well. The value of U.S. commercial real-estate transactions in the first half of 2015 jumped 36% from a year earlier to $225.1 billion, ahead of the pace set in 2006, according to Real Capital. In Europe, transaction values shot up 37% to 135 billion euros ($148 billion), the strongest start to a year since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low interest rates and a flood of cash being pumped into economies by central banks have made commercial real estate look attractive compared with bonds and other assets. Big U.S. investors have bulked up their real-estate holdings, just as buyers from Asia and the Middle East have become more regular fixtures in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surging demand for commercial property has drawn comparisons to the delirious boom of the mid-2000s, which ended in busts that sunk developers from Florida to Ireland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recovery, which started in 2010, has gained considerable strength in the past year, with growth accelerating at a potentially worrisome rate, analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're calling it a late-cycle market now," said Jacques Gordon, head of research and strategy at Chicago-based <span class="companylink">LaSalle Investment Management</span>, which oversees $56 billion of property assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it isn't time to panic, Mr. Gordon said, "if too much capital comes into any asset class, generally not-so-good things tend to follow."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators are watching the market closely. In its semiannual report to Congress last month, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> pointed out that "valuation pressures in commercial real estate are rising as commercial property prices continue to increase rapidly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically low interest rates have buoyed the appeal of commercial real estate, especially in major cities where economies are growing strongly. A 10-year <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> note is yielding about 2.2%. By contrast, New York commercial real estate has an average capitalization rate -- a measure of yield -- of 5.7%, according to Real Capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By keeping interest rates low, central banks around the world have nudged income-minded investors into a broad range of riskier assets, from high-yield or "junk" bonds to dividend-paying stocks and real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lately money has been pouring into commercial property from all directions. U.S. pension funds, which got clobbered in the aftermath of the crash, now have 7.7% of their assets invested in property, up from 6.3% in 2011, according to alternative-assets tracker Preqin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign investors also have been stepping on the gas. China's <span class="companylink">Anbang Insurance Group</span> in February paid $1.95 billion for New York's Waldorf-Astoria, a record price for a U.S. hotel. Another Chinese insurer, Sunshine Insurance Group Co., in May purchased New York's glitzy <span class="companylink">Baccarat Hotel</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">for more than $230 million, or a record $2 million per room. <span class="companylink">China Life Insurance Group Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">Ping An Insurance Co</span>. in April bought a majority stake in a $500 million development project in Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China is looking to other markets as well. Last month, its sovereign-wealth fund bought nine office towers in Sydney and Melbourne, as well as 10 shopping centers in France and Belgium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What has been fascinating has been their speed of deployment," said Iryna Pylypchuk, director of global research at global real-estate services firm <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Europe, buyers are venturing into markets like Madrid and Dublin, where property values haven't regained precrisis peaks. U.K. firm <span class="companylink">M&amp;G Real Estate</span> last month made its first investment in Spain, paying 90 million euros for a vacant 35,000 square meter (376,740 square feet) office building in central Madrid that it will refurbish and rent to U.K. advertising agency <span class="companylink">WPP PLC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're still buying at the low point in Spain," said Simon Ellis, manager of M&amp;G's European core property fund, which has spent 360 million euros in Denmark, Italy, Germany and France since March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The turbocharged activity is a far cry from the depths of the bust. Commercial real-estate prices and sales volume plummeted after the 2008 crash. They began to rebound in a few office markets like New York City and Washington, D.C., in 2010. Investors also began buying multifamily buildings on the correct assumption that the carnage in the housing market would result in surging demand for rental apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">RXR Realty</span>, which began buying Manhattan office buildings in 2009, earlier this year sold a roughly half of its stake in six buildings to <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> in a deal that valued the buildings at $4 billion, more than twice what RXR paid for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A valuation index compiled by Green Street Advisors fell to 61.2 in 2009 from 100 in 2007. It crossed 100 again in 2013. Last week it was at a record 118.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts warn that property values could fall if interest rates rise sharply. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> has signaled it is moving toward interest-rate increases later this year. A surge in rates could have repercussions throughout global financial markets, especially if falling prices trigger a wave of defaults on mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But bulls counter that even if interest rates rise, property values might not necessarily be hurt if higher interest rates are accompanied by higher inflation, which typically allows landlords to raise rents. They also point out that so far this cycle hasn't seen the kind of overbuilding that has destabilized real-estate markets in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Fed</span> and others have noted that banks have been loosening their lending standards. In all, banks had $1.7 trillion worth of commercial real-estate loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter of this year, just 2.6% shy of the record hit in the first quarter of 2009, according to <span class="companylink">Trepp LLC</span>, a real-estate data service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New issues of commercial-mortgage-backed securities are on pace to clock in at about $110 billion this year, a postcrash high and a 17% jump from 2014, according to Commercial Mortgage Alert, an industry publication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Moody's Investors Service</span> also has sounded the alarm about loosening credit standards. "We would have hoped the lessons from the financial crisis would have been more durable," said Tad Philipp, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> director of commercial real-estate research.</p>

U.K. firm <span class="companylink">M&amp;G Real Estate</span> last month made its first investment in Spain, paying €90 million for a vacant 35,000 square meter (376,740 square feet) office building in central Madrid that it will refurbish and rent to U.K. advertising agency <span class="companylink">WPP PLC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're still buying at the low point in Spain," said Simon Ellis, manager of M&amp;G's European core property fund, which has spent €360 million in Denmark, Italy, Germany and France since March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The turbocharged activity is a far cry from the depths of the bust. Commercial real-estate prices and sales volume plummeted after the 2008 crash. They began to rebound in a few office markets like New York City and Washington, D.C. in 2010. Investors also began buying multifamily buildings on the correct assumption that the carnage in the housing market would result in surging demand for rental apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">RXR Realty</span>, which began buying Manhattan office buildings in 2009, earlier this year sold a roughly half of its stake in six buildings[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/blackstone-close-to-buying-50-stake-in-rxr-realty-portfolio-of-new-york-office-buildings-1423680696] to <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> in a deal that valued the buildings at $4 billion, more than twice what RXR paid for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A valuation index compiled by Green Street Advisors fell to 61.2 in 2009 from 100 in 2007. It crossed 100 again in 2013. Last week it was at a record 118.</p>

A surge in rates could have repercussions throughout global financial markets, especially if falling prices trigger a wave of defaults on mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But bulls counter that even if interest rates rise, property values might not necessarily be hurt if higher interest rates are accompanied by higher inflation, which typically allows landlords to raise rents.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New issues of commercial mortgage backed securities are on pace to clock in at about $110 billion this year, a postcrash high and a 17% jump from 2014, according to Commercial Mortgage Alert, an industry publication.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Rebecca Thurlow   </div><div>662 words</div><div>8 August 2015</div><div>05:03</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SYDNEY—Several foreign owners of residential property across Australia have been ordered to sell as the government intensifies its crackdown on the abuse of homeownership laws [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/australia-gets-tough-on-foreigner-home-buying-1433838354] by buyers from China and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasurer Joe Hockey said foreign investors have been ordered to sell six properties in the cities of Sydney, Brisbane and Perth. The homes are valued between 152,000 and 1.86 million Australian dollars (US$112,768 and US$1.38 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The orders could be the tip of the iceberg, with Mr. Hockey revealing probes have unearthed 462 possible breaches of foreign homeownership rules after the government ramped up its spending on enforcement in its May budget. The number of cases being investigated has more than doubled since the last estimate was given in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The treasurer said he expects more divestment orders will be announced soon, and promised to increase penalties for those who break the rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With skyrocketing house prices [http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/economics/2015/04/02/australias-house-price-risks-limited-to-sydney/] putting homeownership out of reach of many Australian citizens, the conservative government is under pressure to make housing more affordable, and rein in surging investor buying that some fear may push the market to unsustainable levels, causing a crash as the economy slows at the end of a long mining boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worry is that money from places such as China [http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/chinarealtime/2014/03/18/australia-to-china-stop-buying-our-houses/] and Southeast Asia is fueling the housing problem. In April, Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board said China had overtaken the U.S. as the country's biggest source of investment from overseas, with a total of A$27.6 billion last year. Real estate accounted for almost half of the money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, the treasurer said he had ordered a Hong Kong-based buyer of a A$39 million Sydney mansion to sell the property [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/australia-orders-chinese-company-to-sell-sydney-mansion-1425378388] after investigators said it was purchased illegally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest divestment orders relate to properties owned by five investors from four countries, including China. Some had purchased property with Foreign Investment Review Board approval, but their circumstances changed and they failed to comply with divestment requirements, Mr. Hockey said. Others broke the rules at the outset by purchasing a property without approval, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investors voluntarily came forward to take advantage of an amnesty from criminal prosecution announced in May, Mr. Hockey said, and they now have 12 months to sell the properties. The treasurer said foreign investors had until Nov. 30 this year to voluntarily come forward under the amnesty if they had illegally purchased residential real estate in Australia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The treasurer said he plans to introduce new legislation into federal parliament in the next two weeks that will increase penalties for foreign investors who break the rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the new regime, nonresidents illegally acquiring established properties will face a maximum fine of A$127,500 or three years imprisonment. They will also stand to lose the capital gain made on the property, 25% of the purchase price or 25% of the market value, whichever is greater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third parties, such as real-estate agents and financial advisers, also may be prosecuted under the changes for assisting in an unlawful purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rules on property buying by foreigners were strengthened about five years ago to restrict purchases to new dwellings that would boost the country's housing stock, with the added benefit of spurring residential construction. Under those rules, temporary residents were allowed to buy established homes with approval from the foreign-investment regulator, but had to sell when their temporary visas expired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, a government committee recommended changes to the rules, including a cleanup of procedures to help uncover illegal home buying, penalties for breaches of the framework, punishments for third-party rule breakers and tweaks to ensure the immigration department informs the foreign-investment watchdog when a person leaves.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. is loosening its underwriting criteria for big mortgages, as lenders ramp up competition to grab a bigger share of the high-end housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's largest bank by assets said it is lowering the minimum credit score and down payment it requires for mortgages as large as $3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York firm's moves follow similar steps at <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>., <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span>. and other banks on requirements for "jumbo" mortgages -- those that exceed $417,000 in most parts of the country or $625,500 in pricier markets. At the same time, some big banks are backing away from smaller loans where they see higher regulatory costs and litigation risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the financial crisis, a recovery in the mortgage market has faced several challenges, but the jumbo market -- popular with well-heeled borrowers -- has bounced back along with sales of higher-priced homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the second quarter, overall jumbo originations rose to an eight-year high of $93 billion, up 58% from a year ago, according to a preliminary estimate from industry newsletter Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By dollar volume, jumbo mortgages given out by lenders last year accounted for about 20% of all first-lien mortgages, used mostly to purchase or refinance a home, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. That is up from 5.5% in 2009. The last time jumbo mortgages accounted for a larger share was in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's no question that the jumbo market has probably recovered more than any sector of the mortgage market since the housing crisis," said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders have more flexibility to change criteria for jumbo mortgages, as they generally hold them on their own books. Many smaller home loans are sold by lenders to mortgage-finance giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, and must conform with their criteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For jumbo mortgages, <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> plans to lower the minimum FICO credit scores it requires to 680 from 740 for loans on primary single-family purchases, second homes and certain refinances on those properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moves by <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> are in some ways more aggressive than those of its peers. The bank is allowing a 15% down payment for loans up to $3 million, compared with <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group Inc</span>., which permit a 15% down payment for jumbo loans of up to $1 million and $1.5 million, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In some cases, our customers have been helped by other banks that have different guidelines," said Sean Grzebin, head of retail mortgage lending at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>. "Some of this is [about] retaining customers we should have gotten and we hadn't because of program restrictions." The bank, run by Chairman and CEO James Dimon, said in July 2014 it was repositioning its mortgage strategy to focus on higher-end customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in jumbo lending underscores a housing recovery concentrated in higher-priced homes. Sales of existing single-family homes priced between $750,000 and $1 million, for example, increased 21% in June from a year prior, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of homes priced between $100,000 and $250,000, in contrast, increased 12.5%, while those priced lower fell 3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The upper end of the segment has improved quite a bit," said Sam Khater, deputy chief economist at <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a real-estate information firm. The improvement is in part because banks are giving out more jumbo loans, as well as the recovery of the stock market, which is highly correlated to jumbo mortgage demand, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home values have helped give lenders confidence that lower down payments won't leave borrowers at risk of owing more on their homes than they will eventually be worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, even though banks are easing lending criteria, mortgage industry experts say the market remains much healthier than it was a decade ago, when low standards and poor underwriting practices contributed to a plunge in U.S. housing prices. Before the housing bust, jumbo mortgages were widely available with no money down and for borrowers with credit scores below 640, noted Mr. Cecala of Inside Mortgage Finance. Some lenders also were giving out these loans without verifying applicants' income, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, borrowers who received a jumbo mortgage in May had an average FICO score of 770 -- the highest since at least the beginning of 2005 -- and made an average down payment of nearly 32%, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Hemperly, head of mortgage originations at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>, said the bank's decision was largely influenced by the strong performance of the jumbo loans it has given out in recent years. Industrywide, nearly 1.9% of jumbo mortgages were 30 or more days late in June, compared with 6.5% of mortgages that conform to the standards of Fannie and Freddie, according to <span class="companylink">Black Knight Financial Services</span>, a mortgage data and services company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>'s changes, which go into effect Wednesday, will reduce minimum down payments for some borrowers to 15% of the purchase price for single-family homes serving as the borrower's primary residence, down from 20% currently. That change applies to mortgages between $1.5 million and $3 million; the bank last year made the same change for jumbo mortgages up to $1.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank also is lowering down-payment thresholds for jumbo mortgages used for second homes, such as vacation homes, and certain two- to four-unit properties. The bank says the changes simplify its offerings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>, which ranks second after <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> in total mortgage-origination volume, gave out a total of $87 billion of mortgages last year, accounting for about 7% of total mortgage originations, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. That is down from about 10% the prior two years and 12% in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several large banks have recently lowered their jumbo-mortgage requirements. <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> last year cut the minimum down payment it requires to 10.1% from 15% for jumbo mortgages of up to $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> began allowing first-time home buyers, which it defines as people who haven't owned a home for at least three years, to make 15% down payments for jumbo mortgages of up to $1 million. The bank previously excluded this group of buyers from its 15% down-payment option, which it rolled out in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PNC in May switched to 15% minimum down payments for all eligible borrowers for jumbo loans of up to $1.5 million, down from 20% previously. Last year, it lowered the minimum required FICO score to 700 from 720.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to easing standards, lenders have been trying to appeal to borrowers with lower interest rates. Historically, interest rates on jumbos have been higher than on smaller mortgages. That changed last August, when for five weeks the average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate jumbos fell below the average for 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages, according to HSH.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While 30-year fixed-rate jumbos on average are no longer cheaper, they are priced very close to their counterparts, with rates averaging 4.07% last week compared with 4.05% for conforming loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The strongest portion of the market is at the high end," said Michael Fratantoni, chief economist at the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>. "You're seeing more lenders in this space. . .and lower minimum down-payment requirements."</p>

</div><div class="author">By David Harrison   </div><div>478 words</div><div>5 August 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Asia</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans curbed their spending increases in June, a sign weak wage growth might be weighing on consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal spending, which measures consumer outlays for everything from doughnuts to dishwashers, rose 0.2% from a month earlier, the smallest gain since February, the Commerce Department said Monday. In May, spending rose a revised 0.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal income, which includes wages and government aid, climbed 0.4% in June after rising a revised 0.4% in May. Both June figures came in as expected by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said last week that inflation-adjusted consumer consumption rose at an annualized rate of 2.9% in the second quarter, contributing to a bounceback in gross domestic product following a disappointing winter. But wage growth slowed unexpectedly in the second quarter, which could have damped Americans' enthusiasm to spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These latest figures set up a soft trajectory for consumer spending heading into the third quarter," Daniel Silver of <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at MFR, pointed to demographic factors: "We expect spending gains to lag income growth as an aging population seeks to boost retirement savings and also struggles with healthcare costs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses have also flagged a reluctance among consumers to pull out their wallets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On an earnings call last month, J.J. Buettgen, chief executive of casual-dining chain <span class="companylink">Ruby Tuesday Inc</span>., cited "relative weakness" in some parts of the country partly due to "relatively soft consumer spending."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, consumer prices rose slightly in June, the Commerce Department said Monday. Prices grew 0.2% from May, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s preferred inflation gauge. Prices were up 0.3% from a year earlier. Inflation has now run below the Fed's 2% target for more than three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices climbed 0.1% from May and 1.3% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed officials are paying especially close attention to the labor market and to inflation as they consider raising short-term interest rates from near zero. Fed officials have said they want to be "reasonably confident" that inflation is moving back toward the 2% level before they move. Many economists believe the Fed will raise rates in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower oil prices and a strong dollar have kept inflation in check in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>, said Monday's price data suggest the effect of lower oil prices is moderating, which could lead to higher inflation readings in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We read the PCE inflation report as suggesting the data have cleared another hurdle for a September rate hike," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kathleen Lucadamo   </div><div>1058 words</div><div>31 July 2015</div><div>06:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Battery Park City has long been cherished for its bucolic look—a leafy esplanade and plenty of park space hugging the Hudson River. But an explosion of high-end stores and must-try eateries in the past few years has transformed the Manhattan neighborhood's landscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You used to want to go across the West Side Highway to Tribeca for a variety of eating and shopping," said Shari Hyman, president of Battery Park City Authority, which owns and operates the 92-acre community. “Now it's the reverse; people come over here for that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past two years, upscale restaurants and big-name fashion stores have opened in Brookfield Place, the former World Financial Center, and more are coming. Pier A, a three-floor structure dating from 1886, was recently renovated into a restaurant and beer garden. In August, SeaGlass Carousel is set to open in the Battery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's really gone above and beyond everyone's expectations," said Jessica Weitzman, a real-estate broker with <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> who has worked in the area for 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the amenities have increased, so have the prices of homes. One-bedrooms fetch about $650,000, but finding a two-bedroom for less than $2 million is a challenge, according to two brokers who said sale prices have ballooned 30% to 50% in the past two years for two and three bedrooms, apartments that are being gobbled by young families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Certainly the market has improved overall, but it feels like Battery Park City has improved more than most areas," said Ms. Weitzman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While more stores are popping up, mainly in Brookfield Place and in the foot of the <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> headquarters on West Street, the number of apartments on the market is largely static, as there is little space for more residential development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a few cases, rental buildings have flipped to condos and demand is intense. One such property, River &amp; Warren condos, just began closing, and already most are in contract, according to Ms. Weitzman. A website for the development shows that seven of the 192 units are available, ranging in price from $2.5 million to $13.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is very little inventory," she said, adding that bidding wars are becoming more common. “I never experienced a bidding war in Battery Park City and I've been here since 2005. In the last year, I've had four."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prices are expected to rise as more businesses move into the World Trade Center, making the area attractive for investors. “The companies that are filling up those towers have employees that are going to want to walk to work," said Ms. Weitzman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those who live in the area and want to trade up to a bigger apartment will have a tough time finding affordable places, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Someone who is looking to stay in the area will have a harder time buying property," she predicts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maintenance is high in many new luxury buildings because of the amenities. Residents don't pay city taxes because the land is owned by the <span class="companylink">Battery Park City Authority</span>, but they are charged a “payment in lieu of taxes," which is essentially the same thing because the rate is set by the city and assessed the same as taxes on other city property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When planned in 1979, the community, which is built on land reclaimed from the Hudson River, dedicated 36 acres for green space and another 36 acres for commercial and residential development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“From the original conceptualization of Battery Park City, it has been about balance," said Ms. Hyman, who has headed the authority since last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now visitors to the 1.2-mile esplanade or adjacent parkland are staying for events, like Shakespeare in Teardrop Park, or dining in one of the eateries. In the past, Battery Park City was a place people walked through but rarely lingered in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowing of construction has also made the neighborhood more accessible. No longer are side streets along the West Side Highway closed because of development, said Ms. Hyman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Battery Park City is also benefiting from the overall popularity of Lower Manhattan, which now houses three times more residents than it did on 9/11, according to Jessica Lappin, president of the Downtown Alliance, a business -improvement district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the surge in home prices squeezing out some residents, Ms. Lappin said it is a struggle for New Yorkers citywide. “It's becoming a challenge for people not just in Manhattan," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parks: The 92-acre planned community is lush with green lawns, well-maintained gardens, playgrounds at Kowsky and Rockefeller parks and a 1.2-mile esplanade along the Hudson River. There is a marina at North Cove and ball fields on West Street. Rockefeller Park houses the Children's Garden, where local children plant vegetables, and the Lily Pond for bird watching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schools: Schools include P.S./I.S. 276, which enrolls about 850 students in grades K-8, and P.S. 234, an elementary school with more than 700 children. Both schools boast test scores far higher than the city average, making them highly sought by parents, and crowded.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this competition, it pays to place fifth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an analysis of numbered streets and avenues, Spread Sheet found that homes across the U.S. listed on Fifth Avenue and Fifth Street have the highest median asking price, compared with other homes listed on First through Tenth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the roughly 40,000 current listings on realtor.com, homes, condos and townhomes listed for $1 million or more on Fifth Avenue/Street have a median listing price of $2.25 million, according to the real-estate listings website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York's Fifth Avenue -- with luxury shopping, world-class museums and views of Central Park -- commands some of the highest prices in New York. "If Central Park was built one avenue over, then Sixth Avenue would have been the street," said Jennifer Ireland, a real-estate broker with New York City-based Brown Harris Stevens. Without the New York listings in the mix, Fifth Avenue and Fifth Street drop to third place in the median asking price ranking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The highest listing on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue is an $85 million seven-bedroom, eight-bathroom condo in the Sherry-Netherland Hotel with views of Central Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Des Moines, Iowa, condos at the new Whiteline Lofts on SW Fifth Street are some of the city's highest-priced properties, said B.J. Knapp, a real-estate agent with Iowa Realty. "If you're on Fifth, you're in the center of the action," he said. "You have the farmers' market and the financial district, and views of the river, the baseball stadium and the Capitol. These are over a million bucks -- and that's a big deal in Des Moines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The realtor.com analysis looked at current listings and included variations on wording, such as First and 1st and Avenue and Ave. Overall, listings on lower-numbered streets/avenues are both more prevalent and more expensive a square foot than homes on higher-numbered roads. "Most cities are laid out where numbered streets move away from a body of water or a park of some sort," said Mrs. Ireland. "That's why you're seeing prices higher in those lower numbers, because they're close to something pretty."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower-numbered roads are also generally in denser urban areas -- where condo and apartment towers outnumber single-family homes, said Javier Vivas, an economic research analyst at realtor.com. (<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, which owns The Wall Street Journal, also owns realtor.com, the listing website of the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, "avenues" are more elite than "streets." The median price of urban condos listed on First through Tenth avenues is 21% higher than those listed on First through Tenth streets.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel   </div><div>863 words</div><div>29 July 2015</div><div>20:47</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City is entering what could be the biggest building boom in a generation, census figures show, as work gets under way on hundreds of residential projects in neighborhoods across the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first six months of the year, developers received new residential building permits for 42,088 apartments and houses in the city, according to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>, already more than in any full year since 1963, when nearly 50,000 permits were issued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge in permits this year followed a rush by developers to start foundation work on many residential projects by June 15, in time to qualify for a valuable property-tax abatement that was scheduled to expire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is a lot of digging going on," said David Schwartz, a co-founder and principal of Slate Property Group, who helped shepherd six apartment projects through the permit process in late May and early June to meet the tax-abatement deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, Mr. Schwartz filed an application for a permit for one building, a 12-story rental tower with 148 apartments and ground-floor retail space at 535 Fourth Ave. in Brooklyn's Park Slope neighborhood, but it wasn't finally approved until June 1. It is now a roaring construction site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strength of the surge surprised many housing analysts, who suggested that it reflected deeper currents in the local economy and housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is an astounding figure, so far ahead of anything the city has experienced in 50 years," said Richard T. Anderson, president of the New York Building Congress, a construction industry group. “We are heading into the stratosphere."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Anderson said the permit wave had “all kinds of implications for the city going forward" and would likely lead to a surge in construction spending this year from the $36 billion spent in 2014, which was a 26% increase from the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, the city issued 17,804 permits, the census bureau reported, more than the average annual total over the last few decades. Nearly half the permits went to Brooklyn projects, with most of the rest divided equally between Manhattan and Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Slattery, senior vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York, an industry group, called the increase “astounding." He attributed most of the surge to the scheduled expiration of the 421-a tax abatement program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The abatement “is an integral part of housing production in New York," Mr. Slattery said. “When you change a fundamental component, people are going to respond to that anticipated change."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wiley Norvell, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said the expiration of the tax abatement usually produces only “a modest bump" and other factors may be in play as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Regardless, this is a city that needs more housing—especially affordable housing—and we are pleased to see so much building under way," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, a building permit doesn't necessarily translate into a completed building, and whether the first half of 2015 is a blip or a trend won't be known for months or years to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the tax-abatement program, developers were required to get full permits and begin at least some construction by June 15, but they have until 2019 to complete construction to qualify for the abatement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A cautionary lesson can be drawn from events in 2008. In June of that year, when permits also surged, benefits of an earlier version of the 421-a tax abatement were expiring. Developers rushed to begin construction, even before obtaining financing. When the financial crisis hit that fall, many projects simply stopped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The sense of urgency that led to the spike in new building permits in 2008 did not necessarily result in a corresponding spike in building completions," warned Mark Willis, executive director of the NYU Furman Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven G. Kliegerman, president of Halstead Property Development Marketing, said much of the latest wave of development has been for new rental buildings in parts of Brooklyn and Queens, in places that hadn't seen private development in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We've been very busy in the first half of the year with new clients and new opportunities, but you've had years and years of below-average building," he said. “Things are catching up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 421-a program was extended at least until the end of the year. A modified program, requiring most participating buildings across the city to provide affordable housing, is to take effect in January. It is contingent on the real-estate industry and the construction unions agreeing on how to set construction wages for the projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On June 4, Mr. Schwartz won approval for another new rental building, a 19-story tower with 126 apartments in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. He had filed the application in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Everybody was under the same deadline pressure," he said. “Every single person you needed to get a project done had 10 other people who needed the same thing."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan   </div><div>576 words</div><div>28 July 2015</div><div>20:02</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Global Logistic Properties</span>, a warehouse owner part-owned by Singapore's sovereign-wealth fund, said Tuesday it is acquiring about 200 U.S. warehouses for $4.6 billion in one of the largest real estate deals of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal, which has been signed but not yet closed, marks a further expansion of Global Logistic's foothold in U.S. industrial property. Late last year, the company and <span class="companylink">GIC Pte. Ltd</span>., the sovereign-wealth fund, joined to buy[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/blackstone-reaches-agreement-to-sell-indcorp-to-asian-venture-for-8-1-billion-1417473843]<span class="companylink">IndCor Properties</span>, another large warehouse portfolio, from buyout firm <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> for $8.1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This latest Global Logistic purchase would mark the second-largest real estate acquisition of the year by dollar value. The company is buying roughly 58 million square feet of space in 20 different U.S. markets from Industrial Income Trust, making GLP the second-largest logistics property owner and operator in the U.S., with 173 million square feet of space under its control, according to the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The acquisition follows Global Logistic's announcement last week[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/global-logistic-properties-launches-7-billion-china-warehouse-fund-1437436980] that it will start a $7 billion infrastructure investment fund to cater to the demand for warehouse space in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fueled by persistent low interest rates, institutional investors are plowing their money into hard assets, especially in real estate. So far this year, buyers have announced 246 real estate deals with a combined value of $57 billion, compared with 197 deals worth $32 billion at the same point last year, according to Dealogic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industrial space has been particularly active. In April, <span class="companylink">Prologis Inc</span>., the world's largest industrial landlord, announced it would buy[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/prologis-to-buy-ktr-capital-for-5-9-billion-1429464155]<span class="companylink">KTR Capital Partners</span>, a large warehouse owner, for $5.9 billion. Prologis is the largest U.S. warehouse owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Values have never been higher" in the industrial real estate space, said Eric Frankel, an analyst with real-estate research firm Green Street Advisors. “Fundamentals are in good shape, tenant demand is very strong, and people are emboldened by that. People are underwriting more aggressively and that means paying higher prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial real estate is currently trading at an average cap rate, or yield, of 5.7%, according to Green Street. Cap rates, a common measure of value in real estate, have been falling consistently over the past few years in the warehouse sector, Green Street says, a sign that property values are on the rise. The Global Logistic deal would value the IIC portfolio at a yield of 5.6%, a slightly higher-than-average price for the warehouse sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, <span class="companylink">Global Logistic Properties</span> said it intends to put IIT's portfolio into its fund management platform, a common practice among large industrial landlords. Large investors like GIC provide the money to buy assets, while operators like Global Logistic use their platforms to manage the properties in return for a fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial Income Trust began in 2010 as a so-called nontraded real-estate investment trust, a type of real-estate fund that raises money through networks of financial advisers from small individual investors, then typically sells the properties at a higher price. Based in Denver, the company built its portfolio in more than 100 separate transactions. Its warehouses were 93% leased as of the end of June.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anna Louie Sussman   </div><div>479 words</div><div>29 July 2015</div><div>11:25</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A forward-looking indicator of home sales slipped in June, but remained well above year-ago levels, a sign the housing market is stabilizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday its index of pending home sales fell by 1.8% to a seasonally-adjusted 110.3, the lowest level since March, but 8.2% higher than June 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index tracks contract signings, which usually close within two months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The May index was revised down to 112.3 from a previously reported 112.6. May's value was still the highest since May 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 1% rise in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm not discouraged by these numbers," said Selma Hepp, chief economist at real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia, Inc</span>. “The anticipation wasn't that there was going be a slowdown, but it's the same story we've been telling for a while now, that the lack of inventory is really constraining the market—the lack of inventory and the lack of affordability."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stronger job gains have helped build momentum in the housing market this spring. Interest rates also remain at historical lows, despite ticking up in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of completed existing-home sales increased 3.2% last month from May to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.49 million, the strongest since February 2007, realtors said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors' chief economist Lawrence Yun said further release of pent-up demand would also depend on whether buyers would wait for more homes to come onto the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The demand is there for more sales, but the determining factor will be whether or not some of these buyers decide to hold off even longer until supply improves and price growth slows," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seasonally adjusted homeownership rate declined to 63.5%, down from 64.7% in the second quarter of 2014, according to estimates published by the Commerce Department on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> analyst Daniel Silver said that the June pending home sales number, because it leads home sales by one or two months, means that slower days could be ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We will likely see some softening in the existing home sales data from their recent high over the next month or so following the June decline in pending sales," he wrote in a client note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales rose 0.4% in the Northeast and 0.5% in the West from May. They fell by 3% in the Midwest and South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also owns <span class="companylink">Move Inc</span>., which operates a website and mobile products for the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent morning at Black Cow Coffee Roasters, white-haired men sipped coffee, three women played mah-jongg for hours, and others gazed at laptops in no hurry to go anywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's summertime, and the living is easy in Croton-on-Hudson, a picturesque, riverfront village in Westchester County awash in history, culture and small-town ambience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I live in the house I grew up in," said Michael Grant, owner of the Black Cow. “It's a postwar Cape that had been added on to. I traveled a lot, and when I married my wife Peggy, she was from Croton too, and we wanted to come back here because it's a great place."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's happy that the only major development is the Half Moon Bay condominiums, an attractive complex on the Hudson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Black Cow itself is on Old Post Road, a street of old-fashioned storefronts with awnings and flowerpots in the Upper Village area, the heart of Croton-on-Hudson. The other business districts are Harmon, near the Croton Harmon Railroad Station, and North Riverside at the foot of Grand St.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 5-square-mile village of about 8,000 people, which hugs Route 9, boasts a diverse housing stock, from Capes and Colonials to the 1950s affordable ranches and split-levels built for homecoming war veterans. There are also rolling estates and refurbished summer cabins frequented by New York City communists in the 1930s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Croton-on-Hudson has thrived as a creative community whose residents have included poet Edna St. Vincent Millay, muckraking writer Upton Sinclair, and now residents such as artist Asya Reznikov, who came to live here from Manhattan three years ago with her husband and young son.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For the same money we were paying in Manhattan we bought a 5,000-square-foot house on two acres with two rental cottages," said Ms. Reznikov, who creates video sculptures. “The train is convenient, and this is country-ish, not suburbia. And we wanted a town with excellent schools."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her family lives in Cortlandt, the town of which Croton-on-Hudson is part, and within Croton's school district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are unusual in that 100% of the Hudson River waterfront, and most of the Croton River, has public access," said Mayor Leo Wiegman, a 20-year resident. “Either the village or the county owns it, and private developers provide easements."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wiegman said the village rezoned the Harmon business district to allow the addition of one or two stories for apartments above shops. “It's a challenge to maintain a small-town feel while stimulating economic development," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suzanne van der Wilden, a salesperson with Croton-on-Hudson Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices River Towns Real Estate, moved from Manhattan, too. She said the median price for a house is $508,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The real-estate market is thriving," said Valerie Leis of North Country Sotheby's International Realty. “We sold a Cape Cod in the village for below $400,000, and we recently sold a mid-century modern on the Hudson for $1.25 million."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One downside to owning in the area is a relatively high property-tax rate: Brokers say the levy on a $400,000 house would be about $12,000 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Leis, also a transplant from Manhattan, is equally enthusiastic about the Croton Council on the Arts, of which she is president. “We have a lot of talented people doing music, painting, photography, performing," she said. “There's always something going on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Grant said there has been a resurgence in Croton: “A lot of the old-timers say it's changed, but a lot of young families move here for the same reason as our parents' generation in the 1950s—because it's a community, it has arts, a fun feel, energy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parks: The area is known for its gorgeous green spaces and waterways, including more than a dozen miles of wooded trails. The newest addition is Gouveia Park, an estate bequeathed to the village by Laurel Gouveia. Its 16 acres of rolling lawns are to be used for hiking, walking and picnicking. Access is limited until the village completes preparing the property for public use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Croton Landing Park offers over a mile of trails and spectacular views along the Hudson River. Croton Point Park is 500 acres jutting out into the Hudson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silver Lake Park, on the Croton River, and Senasqua Park, on the Hudson, are open only to village residents and their guests. Silver Lake is a pristine, serene swimming hole, and Senasqua Park provides picnic facilities and a play area. Duck Pond Park is a tiny, picturesque gem where locals ice skate in the winter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of newly built single-family homes sank in June, although other recent housing data suggests underlying demand has picked up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales fell 6.8% in June[http://www.census.gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf] from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 482,000, the lowest reading since November 2014, the Commerce Department said Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a rate of 550,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government said sales fell 1.1% in May, down from an initially reported 2.2% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most economists shrugged off the latest figures, noting that new-home sales represent only about a 10th of all home purchases and tend to be unreliable from month-to-month. The June figure had a margin for error of plus or minus 12.5 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I view today's reading for the typically volatile new home sales data as statistical noise, most likely just a hiccup on the path to a healthier housing sector," Amherst Pierpont Securities Chief Economist Stephen Stanley said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some said they were baffled by the latest numbers, as many other signs point to building momentum in the housing market, including rising home-builder confidence and a surge of new mortgage applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales jumped 28% in the Northeast last month, but fell 17% in the West, 11.1% in the Midwest and 4.1% in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The volatility in the stock market last month, triggered by the Greek crisis, might well have persuaded people to hold back temporarily from signing contracts—the point when sales are captured—while waiting for the dust to settle," said Pantheon Macroeconomics Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson. “We have to expect a clear rebound in July, and further gains" in the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broader trends suggest the new-home market is gaining momentum along with the broader housing industry. New-home purchases are up 18.1% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales also averaged an annual rate of 512,000 in the first half of the year, compared with an average of 440,000 for all of 2014, said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stronger job gains, accelerating wages and a pickup in the number of young people forming families and moving into their own homes has helped build momentum in the housing market this spring. Interest rates also remain at historical lows, despite ticking up in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> released Wednesday showed sales of previously owned homes[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/existing-home-sales-increase-3-2-in-june-1437574086]—the bulk of the market—climbed 3.2% in June, hitting their highest pace since February 2007. U.S. construction also soared in June, the Commerce Department said last week, though the increase was driven by demand for apartments[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-housing-starts-rose-9-8-in-june-1437136432] rather than single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home builders also appear more optimistic this month. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>' confidence index rose[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-home-builder-confidence-hits-highest-level-in-nearly-a-decade-1437055403] to its highest level since November 2005, to a reading of 60 in July, the group said Thursday. A reading above 50 means most builders generally hold a favorable view of the market for newly built, single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At GL Homes of Florida, a closely held builder based in Sunrise, Fla., sales in June were 38% higher than a year earlier. The builder envisions selling 1,450 to 1,500 homes throughout this year, up from 1,300 in 2014. GL sells homes ranging from the $400,000s to $1.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patty Campbell, GL's division president on Florida's Gulf Coast, cited several reasons for the increase in sales, including harsh recent winters in the north and the likelihood of the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> increasing interest rates later this year. “I think some other markets in the country are now doing better, so (prospective buyers) are back from being underwater and to a point that they feel they can sell their house," Ms. Campbell said. “In Florida, we're getting more corporations moving down here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the market has plenty of room for improvement. New-home sales, which peaked in July 2005 at an annual pace of 1.4 million, are still far from precrisis levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's report showed the price of a typical home cooled last month. The median price of a new home sold in June stood at $281,800, down 1.8% from a year earlier. The average price also fell 2.8% over the past year, to $328,700.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The months' supply of new homes—reflecting how long it would take to exhaust all homes on the market at May's sales pace—rose to 5.4 last month from 4.5 in May and 4.6 in April. Shrinking inventories had been putting pressure on prices in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Hopefully, supply constraints will ease going forward, as builders lately seem more willing to aggressively construct new homes than at any time since the bust," Amherst Pierpont Securities' Mr. Stanley said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Suzanne Kapner   </div><div>703 words</div><div>24 July 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hudson's Bay Co. Chairman Richard Baker says a joint-venture his company set up for some of its real estate could be a model for rivals that are under pressure to extract value from their properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Macy's Inc</span>. is one company under such pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a complicated transaction that closed late Wednesday, <span class="companylink">Hudson's Bay</span> -- which owns <span class="companylink">Saks Fifth Avenue</span>, Lord &amp; Taylor and Canadian department stores -- formed a previously announced venture with mall operator <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group</span>. The retailer contributed 42 properties, and has an 80% stake in the venture. Simon owns the remaining 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since announcing the joint venture with Simon and another one with <span class="companylink">RioCan Real Estate</span> Investment Trust in February, <span class="companylink">Hudson's Bay</span>'s market value has increased by nearly C$1 billion to C$4.9 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Mr. Baker said many retailers aren't properly valued by the market because investors don't fully understand the real estate they hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A solution used in the past has been to sell off some properties and then lease them back, but Mr. Baker said that isn't appealing to most retailers, which don't want the added costs or exposure to lease increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We came up with a strategy where we could show our shareholders the value of our real estate without selling it off," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With property prices rising, retailers are coming under increased pressure to find ways to cash in on their valuable real estate portfolios. <span class="companylink">Macy's</span> is being pressed by activist investor <span class="companylink">Starboard Value LP</span> to spin off its property. The company has resisted taking such actions in the past for fear of losing control of its stores and saddling itself with expensive lease payments, people familiar with the situation have said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starboard estimates that real-estate deals could push <span class="companylink">Macy's</span> shares above $125 from their current level of $72.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its deal, <span class="companylink">Hudson's Bay</span> contributed properties valued at $1.7 billion and signed long-term leases. Using 34 of the stores as collateral, the joint venture borrowed $846 million, of which <span class="companylink">Hudson's Bay</span> will get $600 million. It will use those funds to pay down its own debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simon contributed $1 million to the venture at closing and has committed to investing a total of $278 million over time if certain conditions are met, including $100 million for renovations at the <span class="companylink">Hudson's Bay</span> properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are losing very little cash," Mr. Baker said. The funds used to pay down Hudson's debt will reduce its interest payments by almost the same amount as the added cost of rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Baker grew up watching his father develop shopping centers. And much of his retail investments are predicated on his ability to spot undervalued properties. Last year, the <span class="companylink">Saks</span> flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York was valued at $3.7 billion, more than the $2.9 billion that Mr. Baker paid to acquire the entire chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hudson's real-estate joint ventures are expected to sell shares to the public in three to five years, Mr. Baker said. But even after an IPO, <span class="companylink">Hudson's Bay</span> intends to retain a meaningful stake, ensuring that it continues to capture a substantial amount of the rent payments, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retailers generally are more focused on operating their stores than on figuring out what those stores are worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starboard disclosed last week that it had acquired a stake in <span class="companylink">Macy's</span> and is pushing the retailer to tap into the value of its real estate by possibly mimicking <span class="companylink">Hudson's Bay</span>'s partnerships among other possibilities. <span class="companylink">Macy's</span> said that it is exploring options for its real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Hudson's Bay</span>'s Chief Executive Gerald Storch said that for these transactions to work the proceeds from the real estate should be invested in the businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In our case, we illustrated the value of our real estate and have access to even more money to upgrade our stores and improve retail competitiveness," Mr. Storch said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Stefanos Chen   </div><div>1362 words</div><div>24 July 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On most days, Sherry Grim lives in an 1817 Colonial-style home outside of Gettysburg, Pa., with her husband, Mark. On some days, however, she lives there with Mark's alter ego, Civil War Maj. Gen. John Hartranft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 10 times a year, Mr. Grim, a 63-year-old retired Marine Corps officer, dons Union military regalia to host Civil War re-enactment events at his 3,500-square-foot antebellum home and elsewhere in the community. Indeed, he and his wife bought the place for $500,000 in 2007 because of its Civil War connection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scattered across the 4 3/4-acre property, they have found ammunition, belt buckles and historic coins. A Civil War-era rifle was included in the sale. "It probably doesn't get any better if you're interested in military history," Mr. Grim said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the 150th anniversary of the end of the Civil War, the state of the antebellum housing market is strong, and not just among history buffs. In several markets where battles were fought, home prices are rising and inventory is moving faster than the national average, according to real-estate agents and data from realtor.com, a real-estate listings website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes near Civil War battlefields, even those that don't predate the war, often benefit from conservation efforts to protect battle sites, making those areas more attractive to buyers. But there can be downsides, too: high maintenance costs, deed restrictions and homes that may fallout of step with the rest of the neighborhood when it comes time to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Out of 1.8 million active listings in the U.S. at the end of May, 32,240 were on or near one of the roughly 300 Civil War battle sites, according to realtor.com. The markets vary, but some trends appear, said Javier Vivas, an economic-research analyst with the website. (<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, owner of The Wall Street Journal, owns <span class="companylink">Move Inc</span>., which operates realtor.com.) In the 23 markets with two or more battlefields, all but one have higher median list prices compared with prices last year, and 17 are seeing faster year-over-year listing-price growth than the national average of 7%. Of course, other factors influence buyers in these markets, but proximity to well-preserved battle sites and green space adds to their appeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Franklin, Tenn., near the 1864 Battle of Franklin, Joseph Cashia, a retired health-care executive, and his wife, attorney Angela Humphreys, bought a circa-1810 Federal-style home on 18 acres for $2.85 million in 2006, and have since poured about $1 million into the home's restoration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Living in the home became a treasure hunt. In a hidden staircase, the couple found a sheet of striped yellow wallpaper from the 1830s. They had the sample reproduced for the dining room. Beneath layers of paint, they found "marbleization" -- painted patterns applied to hardwood to make it appear like stone. "The nouveau riche wanted to look a little richer," Mr. Cashia said. On some nights, the couple lights the home with candlelight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I like all things Tennessee," says Mr. Cashia, 58, who is an avid collector of Federal-style furniture from the state. Before moving there, the couple lived in a 1990s "typical box-kind-of home," Mr. Cashia said. In May, the couple listed the home for $4.5 million, saying they plan to downsize to a smaller home in Georgia. They hope the buyer is equally enthusiastic about history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owning a historic home comes with responsibilities. Annual maintenance runs into the six figures, thanks in part to utility bills, like heating, for the main house and caring for the formal gardens, Mr. Cashia said. The home is on the National Register of Historic Places, which aims to keep the home's facade mostly unchanged. Inside, they installed new modern conveniences, such as a new kitchen and a whole-house sound system, but painstakingly avoided damaging the 14-inch-thick walls. Wireless reception is spotty in places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Southern antebellum home can also carry with it difficult reminders of the history of slavery. Mr. Cashia said he didn't think much about the home's legacy -- it was a working plantation before the war -- until an African-American businessman from Chicago and his family showed up at his door in 2013. They told Mr. Cashia that they had traced their family lineage to a former slave on the plantation. Mr. Cashia gave them a tour of the property and has since provided them historical documents he found that shed light on their forebear. The home "has seen the good, and it's seen the bad," Mr. Cashia said, and says he sees his role as a caretaker for the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Fridrich, the listing agent, says selling homes such as this can be difficult: Buyers are either history buffs or farmers looking for ample acreage -- but not both. With 18 acres for sale and an optional 60 additional acres that can't be developed, the potential buyer pool can be shallow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamie and Marcia Constance have been trying to sell their nearly 1,000-acre antebellum estate in Georgetown, S.C., since 2013. The 10,000-square-foot Greek-Revival home, circa 1819, along with several historic buildings and a working turf farm, are listed for $13.475 million, down from $15 million. Mr. Constance, 86, a retired venture capitalist, said they have had three prospects look at the house in two years -- and not all of them were serious buyers. He says he's in no rush to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They bought the property, called Chicora Wood Plantation, in 1984 as a part-time home, and have put more than $3 million into restoring and upgrading it. "It became a passion," said Mr. Constance, who with his wife lives most of the year in Santa Barbara, Calif. Their 2 1/2-year restoration was based in part on books and letters written by an early homeowner's daughter, Elizabeth Allston Pringle, from the early 1900s. The 10-bedroom, 8 1/2-bathroom home has been painted in bright, historically accurate colors, with antique furnishings, ornate moldings and ceiling medallions. They also tend a slave cemetery on the property, which they open to visitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help sell the house, listing agent Carol Jayroe of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> has joined with a niche real-estate listing website called FindEverythingHistoric.com, which caters specifically to history buffs. "You're looking for a needle in a haystack," she said of the hunt for buyers, "but it only takes one."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all pre-Civil War homes are in rural settings -- some sit in the middle of mixed-use neighborhoods. In Fredericksburg, Va., dentist Jim Schwartz is nearing a sale on his Greek Revival-style, roughly 6,300-square-foot home. It was a long campaign, says Patrick McCrerey, the third and current listing agent to represent the home. The home is said to be where Union Gen. Ambrose Burnside billeted during military occupation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the stately home is flanked by smaller houses in the $300,000 range, on a road peppered with commercial buildings. The home started at $1.2 million in 2013. Mr. Schwartz, who is 57 years old, is now under contract to sell; it was most recently listed for $900,000. If the home were located in a more affluent neighborhood, he expects it could have sold for three times as much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dentist and his wife, Bernadette, bought the home in 1993 for $230,000. They raised five children in the home, and now they're selling to move to North Carolina, where he has opened a new practice. What about the home's history appealed to him? "I had a screw loose," he joked. Giving his children the chance to live in a historic home was worth it, he said. "And how many kids can say that?"</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of existing homes sold in the U.S. vaulted to a record high in June, topping the mark set in 2006, as sales increased at their strongest pace in more than eight years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data suggest the housing market is rapidly gaining ground after years of contraction and, until recently, a halting recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for a previously owned home jumped 6.5% in June from the same month a year earlier to $236,400, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday. That eclipsed the previous high of $230,400 recorded in July 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes increased 3.2% last month from May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49 million, the strongest since February 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the numbers reflect a brisk summer selling season, buoyed by a stronger employment picture and buyers anxious to get into the market before mortgage rates and prices rise further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing recovery has shifted into a higher gear," Andrew Hunter, an economist for research firm Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. Many economists said the price gains could taper off toward the end of the year as interest rates are expected to continue rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-price data aren't adjusted for inflation. In 2006 dollars, prices would need to rise about 20% from current levels to set a record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, prices have rocketed 35% since 2011, benefiting current homeowners by giving them an opportunity to trade up to better homes or sell and cash out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher prices also are good news for buyers who have long been underwater, meaning they owe more on their mortgage than the value of their homes, and have been unable to sell without suffering a hit to their credit. Distressed-property sales made up only 8% of the market in June, matching the lowest figure since the NAR began tracking the data in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling unemployment and rising interest rates have spurred more buying, economists said. According to mortgage company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose in June to 3.98% from 3.84% in May. Rates hit a low of 3.35% at the end of 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everyone feels the door closing on really low interest rates and I think this is going to be one of the last months where everyone is scrambling to get under contract," said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, a real-estate brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes account for about 90% of all purchases in the U.S. At the current pace of sales it would take five months to exhaust the supply of homes on the market, the NAR said. Total housing inventory at the end of June increased 0.9% to 2.3 million existing homes available for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 9.8% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.17 million in June, according to the Commerce Department. But that gain was driven entirely by construction of multifamily buildings, mostly rental apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tami Pardee, owner of Pardee Properties in the Los Angeles area, said a major factor driving up prices there is a lack of homes on the market. In Venice Beach, she said, for years there were typically 120 homes on the market. Over the past couple of years, however, that has fallen to about 40.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has left a number of her clients, including working professionals such as teachers, struggling to buy. "If they didn't buy and get in the market it's hard to get into the market unless you have a lot of money," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtor data might also reflect that more of the homes that are being sold are at the top end of the market, not necessarily that prices are increasing for the same home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rapid rise in prices is amplifying concerns that even affluent young professionals are being kept out of some of the hottest markets in California, Colorado and Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ellen Turner, a 34-year-old executive producer at a digital effects firm, and her husband have been looking to buy a home in the Venice Beach area of Los Angeles for more than two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Turner said they are feeling increasingly defeated after having bid on three properties. She said they have been looking for a house under $1.5 million. Houses in that range are consistently going for $100,000 over the asking price, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're a young couple. We'd love to start a family," Ms. Turner said, adding that buying a house had always seemed like an expected precursor to having children, but that seems to be changing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also owns <span class="companylink">Move Inc</span>., which operates a website and mobile products for the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The June bounce came after a strong spring season. Sales were up sharply in May, driven in part by a return of first-time home buyers, which increased to 32% of all buyers from 27% the same period last year. In June first-time home buyers declined to 30% of overall buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If home values rise too much, first-time buyers who should be rising in this improving economy just may be unable to buy a home," said the NAR's chief economist Lawrence Yun.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On most days, Sherry Grim lives in an 1817 Colonial-style home outside of Gettysburg, Pa.[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB10001424127887323689204578573731088501460], with her husband, Mark. On some days, however, she lives there with Mark's alter ego, Civil War Maj. Gen. John Hartranft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 10 times a year, Mr. Grim, a 63-year-old retired Marine Corps officer, dons Union military regalia to host Civil War re-enactment events[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB10001424052748704366104576255170674733458] at his 3,500-square-foot antebellum home and elsewhere in the community. Indeed, he and his wife bought the place for $500,000 in 2007 because of its Civil War connection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scattered across the 4¾-acre property, they have found ammunition, belt buckles and historic coins. A Civil War-era rifle was included in the sale. “It probably doesn't get any better if you're interested in military history," Mr. Grim said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the 150th anniversary of the end of the Civil War[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB10001424052702303847804579481323991648630], the state of the antebellum housing market is strong, and not just among history buffs. In several markets where battles were fought, home prices are rising and inventory is moving faster than the national average, according to real-estate agents and data from realtor.com, a real-estate listings website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes near Civil War battlefields, even those that don't predate the war, often benefit from conservation efforts to protect battle sites, making those areas more attractive to buyers. But there can be downsides, too: high maintenance costs, deed restrictions and homes that may fall out of step with the rest of the neighborhood when it comes time to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Out of 1.8 million active listings in the U.S. at the end of May, 32,240 were on or near one of the roughly 300 Civil War battle sites, according to realtor.com. The markets vary, but some trends appear, said Javier Vivas, an economic-research analyst with the website. (<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, owner of The Wall Street Journal, owns <span class="companylink">Move Inc</span>., which operates realtor.com.) In the 23 markets with two or more battlefields, all but one have higher median list prices compared with prices last year, and 17 are seeing faster year-over-year listing-price growth than the national average of 7%. Of course, other factors influence buyers in these markets, but proximity to well-preserved battle sites and green space adds to their appeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Franklin, Tenn., near the 1864 Battle of Franklin, Joseph Cashia, a retired health-care executive, and his wife, attorney Angela Humphreys, bought a circa-1810 Federal-style home on 18 acres for $2.85 million in 2006, and have since poured about $1 million into the home's restoration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Living in the home became a treasure hunt. In a hidden staircase, the couple found a sheet of striped yellow wallpaper from the 1830s. They had the sample reproduced for the dining room. Beneath layers of paint, they found “marbleization"—painted patterns applied to hardwood to make it appear like stone. “The nouveau riche wanted to look a little richer," Mr. Cashia said. On some nights, the couplelights the home with candlelight[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB10001424052702304432604579473323461246690].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I like all things Tennessee," says Mr. Cashia, 58, who is an avid collector of Federal-style furniture from the state. Before moving there, the couple lived in a 1990s “typical box-kind-of home," Mr. Cashia said. In May, the couple listed the home for $4.5 million, saying they plan to downsize to a smaller home in Georgia. They hope the buyer is equally enthusiastic about history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owning a historic home comes with responsibilities. Annual maintenance runs into the six figures, thanks in part to utility bills, like heating, for the main house and caring for the formal gardens, Mr. Cashia said. The home is on the National Register of Historic Places, which aims to keep the home's facade mostly unchanged. Inside, they installed new modern conveniences, such as a new kitchen and a whole-house sound system, but painstakingly avoided damaging the 14-inch-thick walls. Wireless reception is spotty in places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Southern antebellum home can also carry with it difficult reminders of the history of slavery. Mr. Cashia said he didn't think much about the home's legacy—it was a working plantation before the war—until an African-American businessman from Chicago and his family showed up at his door in 2013. They told Mr. Cashia that they had traced their family lineage to a former slave on the plantation. Mr. Cashia gave them a tour of the property and has since provided them historical documents he found that shed light on their forebear. The home “has seen the good, and it's seen the bad," Mr. Cashia said, and says he sees his role as a caretaker for the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Fridrich, the listing agent, says selling homes such as this can be difficult: Buyers are either history buffs or farmers looking for ample acreage—but not both. With 18 acres for sale and an optional 60 additional acres that can't be developed, the potential buyer pool can be shallow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamie and Marcia Constance have been trying to sell their nearly 1,000-acre antebellum estate in Georgetown, S.C., since 2013. The 10,000-square-foot Greek-Revival home, circa 1819, along with several historic buildings and a working turf farm, are listed for $13.475 million, down from $15 million. Mr. Constance, 86, a retired venture capitalist, said they have had three prospects look at the house in two years—and not all of them were serious buyers. He says he's in no rush to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They bought the property, called Chicora Wood Plantation[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB10001424127887323977304579000663099003146], in 1984 as a part-time home, and have put more than $3 million into restoring and upgrading it. “It became a passion," said Mr. Constance, who with his wife lives most of the year in Santa Barbara, Calif. Their 2½-year restoration was based in part on books and letters written by an early homeowner's daughter, Elizabeth Allston Pringle, from the early 1900s. The 10-bedroom, 8½-bathroom home has been painted in bright, historically accurate colors, with antique furnishings, ornate moldings and ceiling medallions. They also tend a slave cemetery on the property, which they open to visitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help sell the house, listing agent Carol Jayroe of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> has joined with a niche real-estate listing website called FindEverythingHistoric.com, which caters specifically to history buffs. “You're looking for a needle in a haystack," she said of the hunt for buyers, “but it only takes one."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all pre-Civil War homes are in rural settings—some sit in the middle of mixed-use neighborhoods. In Fredericksburg, Va., dentist Jim Schwartz is nearing a sale on his Greek Revival-style, roughly 6,300-square-foot home. It was a long campaign, says Patrick McCrerey, the third and current listing agent to represent the home. The home is said to be where Union Gen. Ambrose Burnside billeted during military occupation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the stately home is flanked by smaller houses in the $300,000 range, on a road peppered with commercial buildings. The home started at $1.2 million in 2013. Mr. Schwartz, who is 57 years old, is now under contract to sell; it was most recently listed for $900,000. If the home were located in a more affluent neighborhood, he expects it could have sold for three times as much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dentist and his wife, Bernadette, bought the home in 1993 for $230,000. They raised five children in the home, and now they're selling to move to North Carolina, where he has opened a new practice. What about the home's history appealed to him? “I had a screw loose," he joked. Giving his children the chance to live in a historic home was worth it, he said. “And how many kids can say that?"</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anya Martin   </div><div>813 words</div><div>22 July 2015</div><div>11:05</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Widespread predictions of an interest-rate increase[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/yellen-sees-u-s-on-path-to-raise-interest-rates-this-year-1436963439] in the first half of 2015 never came to pass. So the jumbo market has kept its mojo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The volume of jumbo mortgages—those above $417,000 in most places and $625,500 in some high-price areas—reached an estimated $160 billion in the first six months of 2015, up about 36% from a year ago at the same time, says Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, which covers the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low interest rates triggered a refinance flurry in the first few months of 2015. And early reports on the second quarter show that a spirited spring home-buying season[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/spring-puts-bounce-in-housing-market-ahead-of-the-tape-1427742640]sustained the growth, Mr. Cecala says. Jumbo mortgages accounted for about 20% of all mortgage originations, indicating a comeback to prerecession levels, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big loans have been performing well all year, including financing for luxury vacation homes, says Bill Banfield, vice president of Quicken Loans. Demand varies by region, “but the coastal markets are appreciating at a larger clip," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The last six months have been great for jumbos," says John Walsh, president of Milford, Conn.-based Total Mortgage Services, which lends in 34 states. Borrowers also benefited from loosened credit guidelines by some new players seeking to add jumbos to their portfolios, he adds. Total Mortgage's hottest jumbo markets for home purchases include the Carolinas, California, Connecticut and Florida, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales in May reached 5.35 million, up 9.2% from a year ago and at their highest since peaking in November 2009 (5.44 million), according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> (NAR). The median sale price for existing single-family residences in May was $228,700, 7.9% more than May 2014. Financed transactions accounted for a larger share of inventory, with all-cash sales down to 24% in March, April and May versus 32% in the same period a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While average interest rates for jumbo mortgages did not dip below those for conforming loans like they did in some weeks in 2014, they stayed historically low and did not fluctuate more than about 30 basis points, or about a quarter of a percentage point, says Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com, a website that tracks rates. Over the first six months, the lowest average rate for a 30-year-fixed rate jumbo mortgage was 3.82% in April, and the highest was 4.15% for the week ending June 26, according to HSH.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five-year, adjustable-rate jumbo mortgages started the year with an average rate of 3.11%, dipped to 2.83% in April, and were 3.03% on June 26.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low rates sparked an uptick in refinancing. “There was definitely a spike in refinancing quarter one, and then [refinances] flattened out a bit," says Jason van den Brand, co-founder and CEO of San Francisco-based Lenda, an online-only lender that currently specializes in refinances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking ahead, interest rates are predicted to creep upward, especially if the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> finally raises its interest rate benchmark in September—a move it has been warning to do for over a year, Mr. Gumbinger says. However, an initial increase would likely be just a quarter percentage point, he adds, though the Fed could make two such raises in 2015 if U.S. economic conditions continue to improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders don't directly use the Fed's rates in determining jumbo rates, but their rates tend to mirror Fed movement and even may take the lead, Mr. Gumbinger says. “If the Fed decided to move, the market will already have made a move," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jumbo volume should stay healthy because a rate increase wouldn't mean much to high-end borrowers with significant assets and cash reserves, Mr. Cecala says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are a few considerations for borrowers:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• For best rate, don't wait. If interest rate is a big concern, refinance or purchase sooner rather than later. Also keep in mind, that a Fed move will affect ARMs and home-equity loans in their variable stages more directly, Mr. Gumbinger says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Shift in lending. There has been some speculation that at some point banks will reach their capacity of jumbo loans in their mortgage portfolios, “but we frankly haven't seen that yet," Mr. Cecala says. “Jumbo mortgages are one of their best yield portfolio products."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Shop around. Some lenders will offer more aggressive rates to borrowers with a strong credit profile, Mr. Walsh says. On the other hand, a few regional banks are tightening credit guidelines as they fill their capacity to keep jumbo mortgages in portfolio, he adds.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 47.4-acre estate in Hillsborough, Calif. with a century-old mansion is going back on the market for $39.9 million—60% less than its original asking price of $100 million[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB10001424127887323375204578272033502000130]in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price isn't the only change. When the property was first marketed, its seller Christian de Guigne IV, 78, had made any sale contingent on him retaining a life estate in the property, which would give him exclusive use of it during his lifetime. The estate was then taken off the market last May. Now, all of these conditions have been removed, said Mary Gullixson of Alain Pinel Realtors, who shares the listing with Brent Gullixson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located on a leafy hilltop roughly 20 minutes south of San Francisco and north of Silicon Valley, the property has been in the same family for 150 years. Mr. de Guigne's grandparents built the approximately 16,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style home; the family said it was designed by San Francisco architects Bliss &amp; Faville (who also designed the St. Francis Hotel) around 1912.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main house includes a ballroom, a flower-arranging room, five bedrooms, seven full baths and two half baths. A staff wing has six bedrooms and three baths. A pavilion with 18th-century Chinese wallpaper overlooks the pool. Mr. de Guigne, whose great-great grandfather co-founded <span class="companylink">Stauffer Chemical Company</span> and the Leslie Salt Company, said he would miss the privacy, the walking trails and the views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sale prices in Hillsborough are up 49.5% in the last five years, according to real estate website Trulia.com.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for architectural design work is picking up, an indication construction spending should advance at a healthy pace in the months ahead, according to the <span class="companylink">American Institute of Architects</span>. The Architecture Billings Index, based on a monthly AIA survey, jumped to 55.7 in June, up sharply from 51.9 in May. The June number was the largest since July 2007, when the index stood at 57.6. A score above 50 indicates an increase in billings. The AIA said June's large increase reflects strong demand for work on new commercial and institutional projects.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christina and Kevin Dirks have been searching for a house in the Denver area for four months at prices up to $275,000. They made offers on six homes -- and were outbid on each one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When we first started looking, you had to pay $10,000 over" list price to win the bidding, Ms. Dirks said. "Then, as the weeks went by, it went up to $20,000. And now it's up to $30,000 and $40,000."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dirks, a 28-year-old office coordinator, said she and her husband, a 30-year-old merchandiser, hope that as the market slows down this winter, "people will put a halt on being so crazy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bidding wars, a hallmark of last decade's housing boom, are making a comeback in a number of metro areas across the U.S. But while the earlier wars reflected enthusiasm fueled by easy-money mortgages, the current froth stems from a market short of homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reasons for the scant supply are myriad, including a much-slower-than-expected recovery in home construction. Yet an equally significant problem is that millions of people aren't listing their homes for sale because they suspect they can't qualify for a new mortgage, can't afford the costs associated with a sale or fear they won't prevail in the scrum for the few houses available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of May, there were 2.3 million existing U.S. homes for sale, enough supply to last 5.1 months at the current sales pace. That is below the six to seven months of supply that the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> says is needed for a balanced market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in more than one-third of the 300 largest metropolitan areas tracked by Realtor.com, homes listed for sale in June had been on the market for a median of less than two months. A low median figure indicates rapid turnover in inventory as demand for homes exceeds supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those include big markets like San Francisco, with a median time on the market of 27 days, and Dallas at 38 days, as well as smaller markets like Vallejo, Calif., at 26 days and Kennewick, Wash., at 36 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tightest market in June was Santa Rosa, Calif., a relatively affordable Bay Area suburb, where the median time a home was on the market was 24 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In those markets with limited supply, bidding wars tend to push prices higher, creating price bubbles. According to Realtor.com, the $580,000 median listing price in Santa Rosa is up nearly 10% from a year ago. That handily outpaces the national average increase in resale prices, which the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> calculates at 7.9%. Realtor.com is operated by <span class="companylink">Move Inc</span>., which, like The Wall Street Journal, is owned by <span class="companylink">News Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The low supply of homes reflects a reluctance or inability of owners to sell their current house or apartment and trade up to their next, often larger one. Some remain skittish about the economy, their own finances or their ability to qualify for a mortgage. Others can't sell because they are underwater, meaning they owe more on their mortgages than the homes are worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though U.S. home prices are up 31% in the past five years, 15.4% of homes -- an estimated 7.9 million -- remained underwater in the first quarter, according to the real-estate website Zillow. The long term average is 3% to 5%, Zillow says. These owners can't sell unless they have thousands, sometimes tens of thousands, of dollars on hand to pay the shortfall on their old mortgage and finance costs of selling and moving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another pressure on housing inventories is growth in U.S. household formation. The U.S. added roughly 1.5 million households in the first quarter from a year earlier, though almost all were formed by renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists say renters will add demand to the housing market as steep rent increases prompt them to purchase. Apartment rents have risen nearly 16% nationwide since 2010, according to real-estate research firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, at least 2.6 million homes have been taken out of the market since 2008 after investors purchased them and converted them to rentals, according to Stephen Kim, a housing analyst at the U.S. unit of <span class="companylink">Barclays PLC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today's seller is tomorrow's buyer, and people aren't selling mainly because they don't have anything to move to or they can't afford what they find," said Nela Richardson, chief economist at the real-estate brokerage <span class="companylink">Redfin Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During times of weak inventory, home builders normally ramp up construction. But though construction picked up this spring, the national pace of building single-family homes in June amounted to just 49.7% of the annual average from 2001 to 2003, which the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> considers the latest normal housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from a lack of demand in recent years for entry-level for-sale housing, a major reason for the tepid construction is a persistent lack of financing for small and midsize builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. estimates that outstanding loans by <span class="companylink">FDIC</span>-backed institutions for home construction totaled $53.6 billion in the first quarter. That figure has climbed steadily from its nadir in early 2013, but it remains 71% below its peak of $186.3 billion in early 2008.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home construction surged in June, driven by demand for the apartments and condominiums that new households tend to favor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 9.8% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.17 million in June, the Commerce Department said Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gain was driven entirely by construction of multifamily housing units, mostly rental apartments, which rose 29.4%. Starts on single-family units, which represent almost two-thirds of the market, dropped 0.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New applications for building permits, a bellwether for construction in coming months, increased 7.4% to 1.34 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In contrast to the multifamily segment, which has been on a clear upward path for some time now, the single-family segment continues to amble along, heading higher but not with any great sense of urgency," said <span class="companylink">Regions Financial Corp</span>. Chief Economist Richard Moody. "Clearly, if slow and steady is your thing, the single-family segment of the housing market is the place for you."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A pickup in household formation among younger adults, as well as rising rental rates, are helping drive the upward trend in multifamily construction and new permits, some economists and observers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Patterson, president of Miami-based Related Development, one of the largest U.S. multifamily builders with 4,000 units currently under development, said apartment and condo projects going under construction now typically were started in development a year or more ago. Thus, today's multifamily construction starts likely came in reaction to the strong run of U.S. job growth that started more than a year ago and last year's increase in household formation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, rental-apartment vacancies remain near multiyear lows, and lease rates have risen by 10% in the past three years to the highest monthly average ($1,194) since research firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>. began tracking the figures in 1980.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the multifamily construction figures are volatile. Construction of apartments and condominiums helps bolster overall figures, but generally provide less of a boost to the economy compared with single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New construction of buildings with more than five units jumped 28.6% in June, hitting its highest level since 1987.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the spike likely has more to do with a surge of activity in New York City last month right before tax incentives for multifamily developments were scheduled to expire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have to expect a big correction in July," Pantheon Macroeconomics Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson said in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall home-construction figures are also volatile and often revised. Friday's report showed new-home construction fell 10.2% in May from the prior month, compared with an initially reported 11.1% drop. Starts in April rose 24.7%, an upward revision from a previously reported 22.1% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction levels for new homes remain historically low, though there are signs of a healthy pickup in activity. Starts were 26.6% higher in June than a year ago, and permits were up 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts in the Northeast, which ground to a halt amid severe winter weather in the first quarter, rose to their highest level since June 2008, largely due to the gain in multifamily construction. Housing starts also rose in the South, but fell in the West and Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Texas, builder CastleRock Communities LP started construction of 144 homes in June, up from 131 a year ago. CastleRock could be building more homes, partner Lance Wright said, but it doesn't have enough skilled tradesmen to handle the volume. In addition, the builder's production process is backed up due to foundation-pouring delays caused by heavy rains last spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CastleRock typically starts building a house within 45 days of getting a contract signed to sell it. "Right now, I have houses sitting 60 to 90 days, waiting to get out of the ground," Mr. Wright said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Justin Lahart   </div><div>538 words</div><div>18 July 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents are rising fast, and that is driving up inflation. That could continue for a while more, but not forever -- to the relief of the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer prices rose by 0.3% last month from May, the Labor Department reported Friday, putting them 0.1% higher than a year earlier. That year-over-year figure was severely depressed by the drop in gasoline costs. Core prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 0.1% from May and were up 1.8% on the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The annual gain in core prices would have been cut in half if it weren't for a 3% increase in the cost of shelter that is being driven by increasing rents. That is because even though rents only represent 9% of the core consumer price measure, the Labor Department computes shelter costs for owned-homes by estimating what it would cost to rent comparable living spaces. This measure, called owner's-equivalent rent, counts for 31% of the core.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in rents is being driven by a tight market. Building of new rental units was constrained by the real-estate bust, so the supply of rental units is lower than it might otherwise have been. And while many of the young people who were homebound in the aftermath of the financial crisis are forming households now, they don't have the wherewithal to own. Commerce Department figures show that the rental vacancy rate in the first quarter, at 7.1%, was just off its lowest level in over 20 years. But new supply is coming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a low-inflation, low-interest environment, the returns to owning rental property are enticing. So prices for rental properties are rising. Driven by prices for rental units, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s commercial real-estate index was up 12.3% in the first quarter from a year earlier, surpassing its 2007 level. The central bank is taking note. "Valuation pressures in commercial real estate are rising as commercial-property prices continue to increase rapidly, and underwriting standards at banks and in commercial-mortgage-backed securities have been loosening," the Fed said in its semiannual report to Congress this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the sort of environment that encourages builders to put up rental properties, and that is what they aim to do. Friday's report on housing starts from the Commerce Department showed there were 512,000 multifamily housing units under construction in June -- the most since 1986. Moreover, there are 20% more multifamily building permits issued in 2015's first half than in the first half of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It takes time to get from permits to construction to completion, though. Meanwhile, an improving job market is likely to keep driving household formation. So, new demand for rentals may outstrip new supply in coming months, sending rents higher and enticing more investors to put money into rental property. But supply will catch back up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Fed mulls when to raise interest rates, it is probably less worried about rent inflation than what could come when rents stop rising.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jumbo mortgages for single-family residences exceed $417,000 in most parts of the country and $625,500 in high-price markets. But with home prices climbing back to prerecession peaks in some markets, baseline jumbo thresholds may be raised for the first time in a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency that sets these limits, the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> (FHFA), in May requested public input on its house price index. This index includes sale-price information on government-backed mortgages as well as real-estate sales compiled by research firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> from hundreds of U.S. counties. Distressed sales are included but not appraisal values from refinances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deadline for input is July 27, and the FHFA will decide this fall whether to change the baseline limit starting Jan. 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the early 1970s, the baseline limit for conventional loans was just $33,000. That was the maximum amount a homeowner could borrow to qualify for a "conforming" mortgage -- one financed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. The $33,000 limit rose steadily over the years to keep up with home prices. Hawaii, Alaska, Guam and the Virgin Islands got higher loan limits because of the high cost of living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 established the current formula, which is based on median home-sale prices reported in a monthly FHFA survey. However, there is some wiggle room in high-cost areas, where conforming loans can exceed the baseline by up to 150%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loan-limit increases encourage more high-end home sales because many people, especially those upgrading for the first time to a pricier home, are more comfortable with a conforming loan, says Allen Decuyper, an agent with Nashville-based Neal Clayton Realtors. "For some it's a psychological hurdle to get over -- just the word 'jumbo' -- so [raising the limit] helps," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, it's also easier to qualify for a conforming loan than a jumbo loan. Mortgages backed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> usually have lower interest rates, with the current difference about a quarter to a half a percentage point below jumbo rates, says Norman Koenigsberg, president and CEO of East Brunswick, N.J.-based First Choice Loan Service. Conforming mortgages also have less stringent underwriting qualifications than jumbo loans, says Mathew Carson, a mortgage broker with San Francisco-based First Capital Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, to qualify for the best rates, jumbo borrowers need a credit score of 740 or higher, while a <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>-backed mortgage borrower may only need 680, Mr. Koenigsberg says. Additionally <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> mortgages allow down payments as low as 3% and require zero to three months' worth of cash reserves, as opposed to typically a 20% down payment and six months' reserves to a year for a jumbo loan, Mr. Carson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More tips on qualifying for a conforming loan:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Put more down. If a borrower has sufficient assets, the easiest way to qualify for a conforming loan is to make a larger down payment or limit the amount of a refinance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Double up. Many borrowers take out a home-equity loan or line of credit to fill the down payment gap. However, because second mortgages typically are adjustable-rate mortgages, consumers should not borrow more than they can pay off within the time period when low rates are locked in, Mr. Carson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Compare rates. During some weeks in 2014, average rates for both 30-year, fixed-rate loans and adjustable-rate jumbo mortgages dipped lower than conforming-loan rates. Even when average rates are higher, some lenders are competitive with their jumbo products when wooing borrowers with high credit scores, Mr. Koenigsberg.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anna Louie Sussman   </div><div>653 words</div><div>16 July 2015</div><div>13:06</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—A gauge of home-builder sentiment hit its highest level since November 2005, reflecting confidence in a steadily improving U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index of builder confidence in the market for new single-family homes stood at a seasonally adjusted level of 60 in July, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said Thursday. A reading over 50 means most builders generally see conditions as positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">June's reading was revised up one point to 60, marking two straight months that the index has been at its highest point in more than nine years. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a reading of 59 in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index has been positive for the past year, following five months in early 2014 when sentiment hovered in negative territory. Although July's sentiment was the highest in nearly a decade, single-family houses starts stood at 680,000 in May, a little more than one-third the number of starts in May of 2005, and slightly more than half the number of starts in May 2000, before the housing bubble swelled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One explanation for the optimism[http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/economics/2014/09/18/if-builder-sentiment-is-so-bullish-why-are-housing-starts-so-low]: since the housing crisis wiped out a number of builders, those left standing are feeling good about what's next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This month's reading is in line with recent data showing stronger sales in both the new and existing home markets as well as continued job growth," said the association's chief economist David Crowe. “However, builders still face a number of challenges, including shortages of lots and labor."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales have picked up in recent months. In May, sales of existing homes[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-increase-5-1-in-may-1434981986], which account for the bulk of home sales, reached the highest level since 2009, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales hit a seven-year high[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-rise-to-7-year-high-1435068249] the same month, according to Commerce Department data. The June new home sales figure will be released Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A solidifying jobs market appears to have finally whet Americans' appetite and capacity for homeownership. First-time buyers have returned to the market, albeit cautiously. While interest rates have edged up since the winter, they remain at historically low levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s July “beige book[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-beige-book-u-s-expansion-continues-pickup-1436983201]" survey of regional economic conditions, released Wednesday, cited increased home sales in most of the Fed's 12 districts and increased home lending in half of them, but several regions noted a shortage of skilled labor in the construction trades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellensaid in testimony to lawmakers[http://www.federalreserve.gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/newsevents/testimony/yellen20150715a.htm] that limited credit for aspiring homeowners could also impede a housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Homebuilding has picked up somewhat lately, although the demand for housing is still being restrained by limited availability of mortgage loans to many potential homebuyers," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since its introduction in 1985, the survey of around 400 home builders has typically had a close relationship to the number of single-family housing starts put out by the U.S. Commerce Department. In the recovery, home builders' positive sentiment hasn't been matched by increased construction[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/home-builder-sentiment-diverges-from-reality-ahead-of-the-tape-1418585217] activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The survey is not a reliable guide to new home sales or housing construction on a month-to-month basis, but it does add weight to the increasing pile of evidence suggesting that a real housing upswing is underway," said Pantheon Macroeconomics Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson in a client note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's report showed the current-sales component of the index rose to 66 this month from 65 in June. Expectations for sales over the next six month rose to 71 from 69. A measure of traffic from prospective buyers fell to 43 from 44.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The builders' gauge rose in three of the four regions of the country in July from the prior month. Confidence only slipped in the South, by one point.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> on Wednesday highlighted rapidly rising commercial real-estate prices as an area of concern amid broadly moderating risks to U.S. financial stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Valuation pressures in commercial real estate are rising as commercial property prices continue to increase rapidly, and underwriting standards at banks and in commercial mortgage-backed securities have been loosening," the central bank said in a semiannual report[http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/economics/2015/07/15/fed-chairwoman-janet-yellens-report-to-congress-live-blog/] to Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report accompanies Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen's testimony[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/yellen-sees-u-s-on-path-to-raise-interest-rates-this-year-1436963439] to the House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, financial vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system have moderated since the start of the year, the Fed report said. In the event of a downturn, the financial sector is positioned to be more resilient because of stronger capital positions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also suggested stocks aren't overpriced, noting the relationship in prices of equities and Treasurys is close to historical norms. As recently as May, Ms. Yellen said “equity-market valuations[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/feds-yellen-cites-progress-on-bank-regulation-1430918155] at this point generally are quite high."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Fed officials are on the lookout for any bubbles in financial markets, especially while the central bank is working to keep interest rates at historically low levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Areas of concern include commercial real-estate prices, underwriting standards for leveraged loans and borrowing by lower-rated businesses. In fixed-income markets, valuation pressures have eased but remain notable, the Fed said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exposure to the crisis in Greece, meanwhile, is seen as limited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Large banking firms' direct net exposures to Greece are low, although financial vulnerabilities from the situation could become more concerning if large European counterparties were weakened by a significant deterioration in peripheral European countries," the Fed said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one area of concern to markets, the Fed said liquidity in bond markets appears healthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> market was hit by unprecedented volatility[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-report-finds-no-single-cause-of-oct-15-treasury-market-volatility-1436801464] Oct. 15, sparking concerns about the structure of <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> markets and the growing role of high-speed trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All told, while the current level of liquidity in the on-the-run interdealer market seems healthy, some aspects of price movements and liquidity metrics in this market warrant careful monitoring," the report said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While essentially all high-volume landfills drag down surrounding home prices, his research has found that some lower-volume facilities can leave nearby homeowners unscathed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a 2010 Journal of Real Estate Research study, Dr. Ready determined that roughly one-quarter of landfills processing less than 500 tons of waste a day have no negative effect on surrounding home values. On average, low-volume landfills pull down adjacent property values by 2.7%, with prices going back up by 1.3% with each additional mile a house is from the landfill. (The study didn't identify the characteristics of low-volume landfills that have a negative impact and those that don't.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-volume landfills (equaling or exceeding 500 tons of waste a day), on the other hand, drop adjacent property values by 13.7% on average, with that pricing impact decreasing by 5.9% a mile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, if you must live near the dump, do try to make sure it's a small one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ready notes that a number of earlier studies had shown little or no effect of some landfills on home values, but that there were concerns as to whether those findings were due to small sample sizes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the JRER paper, he used a meta-analysis of all available landfill/housing-price studies, along with original data from three Pennsylvania landfills, to better get at the question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"And with this analysis we found that, yes, there really are differences between landfills, and we can say with high confidence that not every landfill has the same effect," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent studies have found similar correlations between landfill proximity and home value, but Dr. Ready says he isn't aware of any that have compared sites by volume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking at waste volume made sense in that it is likely correlated with other factors, such as a landfill's truck traffic, physical footprint and visibility, Dr. Ready notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is also relatively straightforward to compare across sites, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less easy to account for is the "aesthetic prominence of the landfill on the surrounding landscape," he says. "Some landfills you can see from miles around and others, if you didn't know they were there, you wouldn't be able to tell."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My intuition tells me that aesthetic prominence must matter," he adds. "But without visiting every landfill that has ever been studied it's really hard to get good measures of their aesthetic prominence."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More home buyers in the U.S. are going for jumbo loans -- and not just in hot luxury markets like Manhattan and San Francisco. Buyers in Denver, Portland, Ore., and even Detroit are increasingly getting jumbos as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes that would require borrowers to get a jumbo mortgage with a 25% down payment has increased 13% in 25 top metro areas since 2012, according to <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>, a real-estate information website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have been steadily rising since January 2012, when home values hit bottom in many markets, says Svenja Gudell, senior director of economic research at Zillow. As a result, more buyers seeking financing need jumbo loans -- mortgages that in most parts of the country exceed the $417,000 limit on government-backed loans ($625,500 in high-cost areas).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's a closer look at three local markets seeing a bump in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PORTLAND, ORE.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes here that would require a jumbo mortgage for financing almost doubled (89% increase) from 4.2% in 2012 to 8% today, according to Zillow. In Portland, the conforming-loan limit is $417,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Portland market has revved up in the past two years but especially in the last six months, says Shannon Baird, a real-estate broker with Portland-based Meadows Group Realtors. Many buyers hail from out of state, attracted by the temperate climate, cultural activities, restaurant scene and outdoor activities, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aaron and Arlene Unverzagt, both age 43, saw Portland as a great place to raise their two children, Jack, 6 years old, and Zoe, age 3. "Portland is family friendly, the size is manageable, and we can travel easily to Mount Hood, central Oregon and the coast all within an hour," says Mr. Unverzagt, a stay-at-home dad whose wife is a marketing executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To score their 3,300-square-foot, Midcentury-Modern home in the Wilcox Estates neighborhood in May, Mr. Unverzagt says he made a rapid offer right at the $825,000 asking price, waived appraisal and home-inspection contingencies and wrote a personal letter to the sellers. They made a 20% down payment and financed the purchase with a jumbo mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of fierce competition, jumbo borrowers have to state upfront that they are willing to make larger down payments if appraisals can't keep up with rapid home appreciation, says Steph Noble, a mortgage consultant for Guild Mortgage in Portland, who handled the Unverzagts' jumbo loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese cash buyers looking for investment properties are a significant part of the current Portland market, Ms. Baird says. Homes priced $700,000 to $1 million often attract as many as 10 offers -- some up to $100,000 above the asking price, she adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home value in Portland was $286,200 in May 2015, only 2.1% lower than its peak of $292,300 in April 2007, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DENVER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, 11.2% of homes listed would require a jumbo mortgage for financing, an 82.3% jump since 2012, according to Zillow. Home-price appreciation has been so rapid that Denver is one of only a few places nationwide where government loan limits were raised from $417,000 to $424,350 in 2015. The median home price climbed to $297,700 in May 2015, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some neighborhoods, it's not uncommon for buyers to make higher down payments to make up for gaps between appraisal values and approved loan amounts, says Chris Magnotta, a Denver-based Guild Mortgage mortgage consultant. "A year ago, when an appraisal came in low, it was on the seller to bring the price down, but now it's flip-flopped," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Colorado's capital, a booming economy and job growth are the main drivers attracting today's transplants, says David Ness, managing broker for Denver-based Thrive Real Estate Group. Of 46 deals that he brokered from January through May, 43 sold for above list price, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A virtual standstill in new-home construction over the past decade is driving prices even higher, Mr. Ness says. In 2006, there were 35,000 home listings. Now there are just 6,909, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DETROIT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 1.9% of homes listed in the Motor City would require a jumbo loan, but that's 108% higher than in 2012, according to Zillow. In Detroit, conforming loan limits are $417,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Mike Blake, a real-estate agent with Detroit's Century 21 AAA North office, sold a 5,600-square-foot home in the suburb of Oxford for $1.8 million. "I have never seen so many $1 million houses up and selling, and there are a lot of new builders moving in, too," Mr. Blake says. "Detroit follows the auto industry, and the auto industry is excelling."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Current Detroit buyers tend to be small-business owners or auto-industry executives buying up. And some of them have a recession-era bankruptcy or foreclosure on their credit reports, he adds. If those borrowers with one-time credit strikes now have sufficient income, some community banks are willing to lend, Mr. Blake says. "I know of two people who filed for bankruptcy in 2012 and got jumbo loans this year," he notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home prices in Detroit were $115,300 in May, still 26.9% lower than their June 2005 peak, according to Zillow.</p>
