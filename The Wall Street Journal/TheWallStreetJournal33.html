<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to the surge of fan interest sparked by Mr. Jackson's death, the singer generated an estimated $200 million posthumously, allowing the estate to pay off tens of millions of dollars in debt and avert foreclosure on the suburban Los Angeles complex where the singer's mother lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Mr. Jackson's death last June 25, his businesses have been run by the singer's longtime lawyer, John Branca, and a music-industry veteran and personal friend of Mr. Jackson's named John McClain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike traditional executors, Messrs. Branca and McClain are aggressively managing Mr. Jackson's affairs as a going concern. The estate's primary beneficiaries are Mr. Jackson's three young children and his 80-year-old mother, Katherine, who is now the children's guardian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Mr. Jackson's absence from the equation has eliminated the chaos and out-of-control spending that reigned during his life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using income from past music sales and advances against future ones, music-publishing royalties, a film-rights sale and various other licensing deals, the estate has paid off nearly $200 million of the $500 million debt the singer had used to fund his extravagant spending in his final years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate has collected as much as $125 million in royalties and advances from <span class="companylink">Sony Corp</span>.'s Sony Music, which has sold 31.5 million Jackson albums since his death and plans to distribute an album of previously unreleased music around November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate sibling <span class="companylink">Sony</span> Pictures paid another $60 million for the rights to "This Is It," the documentary about rehearsals for Mr. Jackson's planned comeback concert series.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mijac, the publishing company that controls the copyrights to songs written by Mr. Jackson, is on track to generate $35 million in royalties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate is set to collect $11 million in dividends from <span class="companylink">Sony/ATV Music Publishing</span>, the joint venture with <span class="companylink">Sony Corp</span>. that controls 251 songs by the Beatles. Television and merchandise deals could generate an additional $10 million, while deals to create a videogame and two Cirque du Soleil shows based on Mr. Jackson's music are set to provide additional revenue later this year. The Sony Music deal guarantees Mr. Jackson's estate significant additional cash advances in coming years, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Jackson's biggest financial obligation remains unresolved. A $300 million loan from <span class="companylink">Barclays PLC</span>, backed by his 50% stake in SONY/ATV, matures at the end of the year. To secure the loan in 2006, Mr. Jackson appealed for help from <span class="companylink">Sony</span>, which dispatched two executives to meet him in Dubai and negotiate terms under which it would guarantee the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, Mr. Jackson was in danger of defaulting on a $270 million loan held by hedge fund <span class="companylink">Fortress Investment Group LLC</span>. As part of the agreement under which <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> ultimately refinanced that debt, Mr. Jackson granted <span class="companylink">Sony</span> an option to buy half of his stake in the company at any time for a fixed price of $250 million. At the time that was a generous valuation, but <span class="companylink">Sony</span>/ATV's value has since soared to around $2 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Jackson estate and <span class="companylink">Sony</span> have held talks about whether the company will again guarantee a refinancing of the debt backed by Mr. Jackson's <span class="companylink">Sony</span>/ATV stake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it won't, the estate could be forced to sell its stake in <span class="companylink">Sony</span>/ATV at a steep discount, though that would still generate enough cash to wipe out the <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> loan with hundreds of millions to spare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Sony</span> may have an incentive to reach a deal on refinancing, because buying out Mr. Jackson's estate would require it to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for an asset it already effectively controls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this stands in stark contrast to the state of affairs when Mr. Jackson died. Despite being poised for what was heralded as a major comeback concert series, his finances were in shambles and he was unable to meet some of his most basic financial obligations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the unpaid bills at the time of his death, Mr. Jackson had not paid $341,000 to Thomas Mesereau, the lawyer who successfully defended him against charges of child molestation in 2005. That bill and many other creditors' claims, including invoices from several other law firms, have now been paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The singer was also months behind on utility bills for his longtime family home in Encino, Calif., where his mother, Katherine, now lives with his three children, along with the children of two of his brothers. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, owed nearly $9,000, was threatening to disconnect service. <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T Inc</span>. was owed $1,300.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jackson was living in a rented mansion in Holmby Hills, a ritzy neighborhood near Bel Air, covering his sizable personal overhead with a $35 million cash advance from <span class="companylink">AEG Live</span>, the concert promoter that was planning to stage his London concerts. That loan, too, has been repaid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jackson's debts were spiraling out of control in other ways, too. A loan backed by Mijac carried a crushing 16.5% interest rate, to be paid out of royalties generated by the company. When the royalty payments fell short of the towering cost of servicing the debt, any unpaid interest was piled on to the principal. As a result, by the time of his death, the Mijac loan had reached $75 million, with $11 million due in annual interest, which was several million dollars more than the catalog was generating annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loan has now been refinanced with an interest rate of less than 4%. And thanks to increased album sales since Mr. Jackson's death and a new deal for public-performance royalties, the catalog is generating enough cash to pay off the refinanced loan a little more than a year from now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking to raise cash Mr. Jackson had planned to auction most of his personal effects from Neverland, his 2,600-acre ranch near Santa Barbara. In 2008, after he had defaulted on a $24.5 million loan backed by the ranch itself, the property was spared from foreclosure when <span class="companylink">Colony Capital LLC</span>, a Los Angeles real-estate investment firm, bought the note and put the property into a joint venture with Mr. Jackson.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing-market boost driven by tax credits has faded, damping builders' incentives to construct new homes in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. industrial production strengthened as a key inflation indicator remained tame in the face of a sluggish recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts fell 10% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 593,000 in May, the month after the government ended its home-buyer tax credit. Single-family housing starts slid 17.2% to an annual rate of 468,000, the lowest level in a year. Permits for new construction also fell, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The plunge in housing starts in May underlines that a sustained housing rebound has yet to get under way," said Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist for IHS Global Insight. "Now the credit is gone, it's time for the payback."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decrease confirmed fears that a fitful recovery could falter with the April 30 end of a tax credit created early last year for first-time home buyers. Even though prices and mortgage rates are low, the job market is weak. "Starts should be soaring at this point of the business cycle," said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But builders are having trouble getting financing, and many buyers are looking to existing homes instead of new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are also cautious about a surplus of unsold homes, including a so-called shadow inventory made up of property withheld from the market because of low prices. When prices climb enough, that inventory will flow into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, May apartment construction -- housing with two or more units -- rose 33% to an annual rate of 125,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report from the Labor Department showed inflation pressures remained tame in May as producer prices fell along with energy and food prices, although the cost of certain finished goods continued to rise. The index of producer prices, which measures how much manufacturers and wholesalers pay for goods and materials, fell a seasonally adjusted 0.3% for finished goods in May from April. It was the second monthly decline in a row, following an unrevised 0.1% drop in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stripping out more-volatile food and energy prices, however, the Labor Department report showed that wholesale inflation rose by 0.2% last month as prices rose for light trucks. In April, core producer prices had also risen 0.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third report out Wednesday, this one from the Federal Reserve, showed U.S. industrial output accelerated in May, its third straight gain. Overall industrial production in May increased 1.2%, the Fed reported. That was slightly above expectations for a 1% increase. April's industrial production was revised to 0.7% from 0.8%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Craig Karmin </div><div>984 words</div><div>16 June 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A23</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate broker Suzun Bennet had a Central Park West condo sale in hand last month when suddenly the buyer, a Belgian worried about Europe's plummeting stock markets and currency, pulled out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He returned, two weeks later, with a reduced offer of less than $5 million for the three-bedroom apartment. It was quickly accepted, but the sale isn't expected to close until August. Ms. Bennet, with Halstead Property, doesn't want to think about the Belgian having second thoughts about closing if Europe's markets and the euro take another turn for the worse. "That's another scary bit," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe's brewing economic turmoil that began with a government debt crisis in Greece -- which saw its credit rating slashed to junk status by another rating agency on Monday -- is spreading its malaise across the continent and has punished financial markets world-wide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also threatens to claim a more local victim: New York City's residential market. That's because the declining value of Europe's main currencies, the euro and the British pound, has sharply increased prices Europeans must pay after they translate their currency into dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro's 25% depreciation against the dollar, to less than $1.20 earlier this month, means Europeans are paying a quarter more for New York property in dollar terms than they did two years ago when one euro would buy $1.60. The British pound, valued at $2 in March 2008 but recently trading below $1.45, has taken a similar plunge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some New York brokers say affluent buyers from abroad will be attracted to a stronger dollar and the relative stability of property in the city, others say Europe's debt crisis is making buyers jittery about indulging in a Manhattan pied--a--terre or tying up cash anywhere outside their home countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm spending a lot of time talking people off the ledge," says Dolly Lenz, a top-selling broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman, referring to Italian, Spanish and English clients who are getting cold feet about buying in the city. "I'm doing this daily. People are losing confidence that it's going to turn around quickly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their reticence comes as the New York housing market is showing signs of a tentative comeback; any European pullback would be an unwelcome headwind in face of that recent momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there are no official records of foreign owners of city property, appraiser Jonathan Miller estimates that overseas buyers typically account for 15% to 20% of the Manhattan condo market. But when the dollar declined against other currencies a few years ago, demand from foreign buyers picked up. During the boom, Mr. Miller estimates that foreigners represented about 30% of condo buyers, with Europeans accounting for most of those sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The foreign buyer has always been an important contributor to demand for New York City real estate," Mr. Miller says. "And there's been a pullback," especially among those who aimed to exploit the exchange rate. In the late 1980s, he added, Japanese rushed to buy New York condos, sight-unseen, when the yen and Japan's economy were roaring. But that activity evaporated after Japan slid into recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For certain buildings that have leaned heavily on foreign sales, any further extension of the current decline in the euro could be especially painful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Setai Fifth Avenue, a hotel and condo that is expected to open in November, virtually all the initial buying interest has come from abroad, in particular Italy and other parts of Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European soccer players and chief executive officers were among the first to sign contracts, says Giuseppe Rossi, executive vice president for the developer Bizzi &amp;Partners. "People saw a floor plan and arrived with a check," he says. "There was a big excitement when the euro was very, very high."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now? "The market has changed," Mr. Rossi says. Sales to foreigners have slowed considerably, and the developers are for the first time concentrating on domestic buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Trump SoHo, another new condo-hotel, foreigners account for about two-thirds of the contracts, says Rodrigo Nino, president of Prodigy Network which is marketing the building. Europe's economic woes "are putting pressure on their investment requirements," Mr. Nino says, making these part-time condos a tougher sell abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that every Roman or Parisian is cowering under the once-again mighty dollar. Brokers are happy to reel off examples where the wealthiest foreigners see New York property as a sound investment at a time when European assets are under siege. While mortgage financing at U.S. banks remains tight, these buyers typically pay all in cash. "I'm getting a lot of calls from Europeans," says Charlie Attias, a Corcoran broker who says he recently sold apartments in Chelsea and Gramercy Park to buyers from there. "They say America is coming out of the recession faster and see positive signs in the real-estate market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Privately, much of the industry is growing anxious that European demand among the speculative or less well-heeled buyer may be softening. Brokers worry that some Europeans who bought New York property near the peak and took a hit of 20% to 30% may have made enough back in currency appreciation to cancel out investment declines. That break-even point could trigger sales, putting more supply on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A certain type of European buyer that left a strong footprint on New York during the boom years may be gone for a very long time: middle-class professionals from countries such as Spain and Ireland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spain and Ireland are now considered among the more vulnerable economies in Europe. As for their run as strong New York buyers, "That period was an anomaly," says Mr. Miller.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Dallas Condo Project: Exception to the Slump --- Groundbreaking on $200 Million Development Gets Backing by Local Pension; 'Timing Is Perfect â ¦ to Pull the Trigger'</span>
</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos and Kris Hudson </div><div>844 words</div><div>16 June 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers have secured financing and will start construction later this month on a long-planned luxury high-rise condominium in Dallas, an unusual example of new development for a sector that was particularly battered by the housing bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the rise of the 42-story Museum Tower underscores why new condo construction is likely to prove the exception and not the rule: The $200 million project, located in a prime parcel in an up-and-coming arts district, is being financed entirely by the Dallas Police &amp;Fire Pension System.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the deal to move forward, the $3 billion pension fund will take 100% ownership of the project. Co-developers Brook Partners Inc. and Turtle Creek Holdings Inc. will remain involved in the project, but they are giving up their equity stake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the groundbreaking is moving forward precisely because Dallas largely sat out the overbuilding and the accompanying housing crash. Home prices are down just 9% from their August 2007 peak, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index, while unemployment in Dallas stood at 8.2% in April, more than a full percentage point below the U.S. average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the financial crisis in 2008 forced developers to delay their ambitious plans for what would become the city's second-largest residential tower. Conceived as a 20-story, $100 million building, the project grew after the Dallas pension fund urged developers to supersize the glass tower and raised its initial stake to $32 million to accommodate its vision for a city landmark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brook Partners and Turtle Creek struggled for months to find conventional financing before turning again to the pension fund, which is now financing the entire $200 million project. "We talked to every lender imaginable," says John Sughrue, Brook Partners' chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asking prices for the units will start at $1.1 million, among the highest in Dallas. The pension system says it expects a double-digit rate of return on a project that it believes has the best location of any new development in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given low interest rates and low construction costs, "the timing is perfect . . . to pull the trigger," Richard Tettamant, the pension fund's administrator, said in an interview Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While much of the rest of the country is dealing with a real-estate hangover, Mr. Tettamant says that the city's economy should make the investment a sound one. "Dallas is unique. It's got this can-do attitude about it," Mr. Tettamant said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dallas has been among the cities that have seen a downtown residential renaissance over the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 737 condo units have been developed in its core downtown area in that span, according to Residential Strategies, a real-estate consulting firm. An additional 654 units have sprouted in the adjacent Uptown district and 375 have been added in nearby Victory Park, a mixed-use project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Museum Tower trumpets its setting as the chief selling point. The 1.5-acre parcel, currently a parking lot, sits squarely in the middle of the $2 billion Dallas Arts District that city officials tout as the largest of its kind in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The district is the "focal point of the revitalization going on downtown now," says John Crawford, chief executive of Downtown Dallas Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tower site is bounded to the east by the $350 million <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span> Performing Arts Center, which opened last October, the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center, and the Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre; to the west, by the Nasher Sculpture Center and the Dallas Museum of Art. Along the northern boundary runs a below-grade freeway that is slated to be covered by a four-block city park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Close proximity to those amenities, however, doesn't guarantee rapid sales. Crescent Real Estate Equities LP in 2007 sold out the 70 condos in the first tower of its <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> Residences just two blocks from Museum Tower's site. However, the Ritz's 95-unit second tower, which saw greater interest among investors looking to flip units, has 45 condos still available, and distressed sales have put pressure on values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The appraisals have gone south," says Michael Puls, of consultancy Foley &amp;Puls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales have slowed in Victory Park, a development west of the Arts District that is geared toward a younger crowd. While the W Dallas has sold most of its 143 condos, sales in the 133-unit House have been slower than expected, and <span class="companylink">Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group</span> canceled its plans for a hotel-and-condo project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Museum Tower, just 13 units in the 123-unit building were under contract in March, though the sales team hasn't been actively pursuing contracts, according to a report from Residential Strategies. Construction could be completed by the end of 2012.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Deal of the Week -- Wells Fargo's Levitt Tack: Build It and They'll Come</span>
</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi </div><div>753 words</div><div>16 June 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales of seven stalled Levitt &amp;Sons LLC housing developments in Georgia, Florida and South Carolina have recouped roughly $65 million of some $122 million in soured loans on the projects held by <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp;Co</span>., according to an attorney for the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales were part of the final chapter for Levitt, the home builder that gained fame as the company behind Levittown, N.Y., one of the nation's first suburban tract developments built on Long Island after World War II. After changing hands a number of times it evolved into a developer of Southern retirement communities. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2007, discontinued operations and now is in the process of liquidating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prices are a sign that land values are still far from their highs even though investor appetite for land has improved from the depths of the downturn. "It's still a world of hurt," says Thomas Kirschbraun, a managing director with <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> in Chicago, which was hired to market and sell five of the Levitt properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kirschbraun notes that far-flung locations on the edges of metropolitan areas are faring the worst and those in established urban or suburban locations with some homes ready for sale are fetching better prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lesson of the Levitt liquidation may be the approach that <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> took to minimize its losses. After the builder's bankruptcy filing, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> agreed to fund a $3 million revolving line of credit to help finish building such amenities as clubhouses and sell some completed homes, says Soneet Kapila, the court-appointed chief administrator of the Levitt properties tied to the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That approach is relatively rare because many banks are leery of sinking more money into troubled properties for fear of throwing good money after bad. But <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> bet that the properties, comprising more than 1,800 acres in various stages of completion, would unlock more value and attract more buyers if investors could see that property was maintained and close to generating revenue. "In the last two years, the last thing that people wanted was land," Mr. Kapila said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Carson, an attorney who represented <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> in the bankruptcy, says <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> realized $65 million in net proceeds on the sales of the properties, including some sales of individual homes, after deducting the costs for operations including constructing some homes and amenities. "Developing the properties gave us much better value," Mr. Kapila says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first quarter, the average price paid per acre in the U.S. rose slightly to $41,651 from about $36,829 in 2009, according to real-estate services firm <span class="companylink">CoStar Group Inc</span>. Still, the total volume of land sales remained thin with about $3.1 billion trading in the first quarter compared with about $41.2 billion changing hands in 2007, and the average price per acre is still well below the $102,631 reached that year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the winning bidders for the Levitt land were home builders, some with existing operations in the area that could manage the new properties without taking on new overhead costs. For example, Medallion Home of Bradenton, Fla., paid $3 million for a Levitt development called Cascades at Sarasota near its headquarters. Pete Logan, vice president of Medallion, says sales prices for the homes in the Cascades community that is restricted to adults aged 55 and older are now fetching prices starting at $250,000, compared with the $229,000 that Medallion initially commanded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most of the properties as well as some individual homes were sold by the end of last year, others took longer. The toughest and last of the properties to sell was the nearly 900-acre Seasons and Waterstone at Seven Hills in Georgia, sometimes treated as two developments, roughly 30 miles outside of Atlanta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property may have drawn less interest because it had no buildings or homes constructed and investors couldn't immediately realize any profits. Investors also may have been concerned that such exurban locations could be less valuable if growth doesn't push out as far as expected and higher gas prices make commutes less feasible, <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>'s Mr. Kirschbraun says. The property ultimately sold last month for $4.3 million to a local builder identified as SAWS at Seven Hills.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi   </div><div>742 words</div><div>16 June 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales of seven stalled Levitt &amp; Sons LLC housing developments in Georgia, Florida and South Carolina have recouped roughly $65 million of some $122 million in soured loans on the projects held by <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span>., according to an attorney for the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales were part of the final chapter for Levitt, the home builder that gained fame as the company behind Levittown, N.Y., one of the nation's first suburban tract developments built on Long Island after World War II. After changing hands a number of times it evolved into a developer of Southern retirement communities. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2007, discontinued operations and now is in the process of liquidating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prices are a sign that land values are still far from their highs even though investor appetite for land has improved from the depths of the downturn. "It's still a world of hurt," says Thomas Kirschbraun, a managing director with <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> in Chicago, which was hired to market and sell five of the Levitt properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kirschbraun notes that far-flung locations on the edges of metropolitan areas are faring the worst and those in established urban or suburban locations with some homes ready for sale are fetching better prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lesson of the Levitt liquidation may be the approach that <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> took to minimize its losses. After the builder's bankruptcy filing, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> agreed to fund a $3 million revolving line of credit to help finish building such amenities as clubhouses and sell some completed homes, says Soneet Kapila, the court-appointed chief administrator of the Levitt properties tied to the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That approach is relatively rare because many banks are leery of sinking more money into troubled properties for fear of throwing good money after bad. But <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> bet that the properties, comprising more than 1,800 acres in various stages of completion, would unlock more value and attract more buyers if investors could see that property was maintained and close to generating revenue. "In the last two years, the last thing that people wanted was land," Mr. Kapila said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Carson, an attorney who represented <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> in the bankruptcy, says <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> realized $65 million in net proceeds on the sales of the properties, including some sales of individual homes, after deducting the costs for operations including constructing some homes and amenities. "Developing the properties gave us much better value," Mr. Kapila says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first quarter, the average price paid per acre in the U.S. rose slightly to $41,651 from about $36,829 in 2009, according to real-estate services firm <span class="companylink">CoStar Group Inc</span>. Still, the total volume of land sales remained thin with about $3.1 billion trading in the first quarter compared with about $41.2 billion changing hands in 2007, and the average price per acre is still well below the $102,631 reached that year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the winning bidders for the Levitt land were home builders, some with existing operations in the area that could manage the new properties without taking on new overhead costs. For example, Medallion Home of Bradenton, Fla., paid $3 million for a Levitt development called Cascades at Sarasota near its headquarters. Pete Logan, vice president of Medallion, says sales prices for the homes in the Cascades community that is restricted to adults aged 55 and older are now fetching prices starting at $250,000, compared with the $229,000 that Medallion initially commanded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most of the properties as well as some individual homes were sold by the end of last year, others took longer. The toughest and last of the properties to sell was the nearly 900-acre Seasons and Waterstone at Seven Hills in Georgia, sometimes treated as two developments, roughly 30 miles outside of Atlanta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property may have drawn less interest because it had no buildings or homes constructed and investors couldn't immediately realize any profits. Investors also may have been concerned that such exurban locations could be less valuable if growth doesn't push out as far as expected and higher gas prices make commutes less feasible, <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>'s Mr. Kirschbraun says. The property ultimately sold last month for $4.3 million to a local builder identified as SAWS at Seven Hills.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate broker Suzun Bennet had a Central Park West condo sale in hand last month when suddenly the buyer, a Belgian worried about Europe's plummeting stock markets and currency, pulled out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He returned, two weeks later, with a reduced offer of less than $5 million for the three-bedroom apartment. It was quickly accepted, but the sale isn't expected to close until August. Ms. Bennet, a broker with Halstead Property, doesn't want to think about the Belgian having second thoughts about closing if Europe's markets and the euro take another turn for the worse. "That's another scary bit,'' she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe's brewing economic turmoil that began with a government debt crisis in Greece—which saw its credit rating slashed to junk status by another rating agency on Monday—is spreading its malaise across the continent and has punished financial markets world-wide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also threatens to claim a more local victim: New York City's residential market. That's because the declining value of Europe's main currencies—the euro and the British pound—has sharply increased prices that Europeans must pay after they translate their currency into dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro's 25% depreciation against the dollar, to less than $1.20 earlier this month means that Europeans are paying a quarter more for New York property in dollar terms than they did two years ago when one euro was exchanged into $1.60. The British pound, valued at $2 in March 2008 but recently trading below $1.45, has taken a similar plunge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some New York brokers say that affluent buyers from abroad will be attracted to a stronger dollar and the relative stability of property in the city, others say Europe's debt crisis has already made some jittery about indulging in a Manhattan pied–à–terre or tying up cash anywhere outside their home countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm spending a lot of time talking people off the ledge,'' says Dolly Lenz, a top-selling broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman, referring to Italian, Spanish and English clients who are getting cold feet about buying in the city. "I'm doing this daily. People are losing confidence that it's going to turn around quickly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their reticence comes as the New York housing market is showing signs of a tentative comeback; any European pullback would be an unwelcome headwind in face of that recent momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there are no official records of foreign owners of city property, appraiser Jonathan Miller estimates that overseas buyers typically account for 15% to 20% of the Manhattan condo market. But when the dollar declined against other currencies a few years ago, demand from foreign buyers picked up. During the boom, Mr. Miller estimates that foreigners represented about 30% of condo buyers, with Europeans representing most of those sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The foreign buyer has always been an important contributor to demand for New York City real estate,'' Mr. Miller says. "And there's been a pullback,'' especially among those who aimed to exploit the exchange rate. In the late 1980s, he added, Japanese rushed to buy New York condos, sight-unseen, when the yen and Japan's economy were roaring. But that activity evaporated after Japan slid into recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For certain buildings that have leaned heavily on foreign sales, any further extension of the current decline in the euro could be especially painful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Setai Fifth Avenue, a hotel and condo that is expected to open in November, virtually all the initial buying interest has come from abroad, in particular Italy and other parts of Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European soccer players and chief executive officers were among the first to sign contracts, says Giuseppe Rossi, executive vice president for the developer Bizzi &amp; Partners. "People saw a floor plan and arrived with a check,'' he says. "There was a big excitement when the euro was very, very high.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now? "The market has changed,'' Mr. Rossi says. Sales to foreigners have slowed considerably, and the developers are for the first time concentrating on domestic buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Trump SoHo, another new condo-hotel, foreigners account for about two-thirds of the contracts, says Rodrigo Nino, president of Prodigy Network which is marketing the building. Europe's economic woes "are putting pressure on their investment requirements,'' Mr. Nino says, making these part-time condos a tougher sell abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that every Roman or Parisian is cowering under the once-again mighty dollar. Brokers are happy to reel off examples where the wealthiest foreigners see New York property as a sound investment at a time when European assets are under siege. While mortgage financing at U.S. banks remains tight, these buyers typically pay all in cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm getting a lot of calls from Europeans,'' says Charlie Attias, a Corcoran broker who says he recently sold apartments in Chelsea and Gramercy Park to buyers from there. "They say America is coming out of the recession faster and see positive signs in the real-estate market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Privately, however, much of the industry is growing anxious that European demand among the speculative or less well-heeled buyer may be softening. Brokers worry that some Europeans who bought New York property near the peak and took a hit of 20% to 30% may have made enough back in currency appreciation to cancel out investment declines. That break-even point could trigger sales among some of these owners, putting more supply on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A certain type of European buyer that left a strong footprint on New York during the boom years may be gone for a very long time: middle-class professionals from countries like Spain and Ireland. Their buying presence in New York disappeared when the financial crisis erupted in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spain and Ireland are now considered among the more vulnerable economies in Europe. As for their run as strong New York buyers, "That period was an anomaly,'' says Mr. Miller.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel </div><div>856 words</div><div>14 June 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A19</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rise in apartment sales in Manhattan during the spring selling season, especially among expensive co-ops, led to an upward bump in average prices, according to an analysis of recent transactions, giving hope to brokers and analysts looking for a housing turnaround.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preliminary figures compiled by The Wall Street Journal show that the median price of a Manhattan co-op hit $685,000 last month, up 9.5% when compared with the previous month and 14% higher than May 2009, when co-op prices bottomed. The median condominium price was $1.2 million, up by 4.6% compared to the previous month and 13.8% versus May 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest data lend support to brokers, in midst of what is usually the biggest selling season of the year, who have reported a significant turn in sales activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gains in median prices don't necessarily mean that prices overall are appreciating. The Wall Street Journal analysis found sales picked up the most for higher-end properties, which pushed up the average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales statistics were compiled from condominium deeds and co-op tax documents filed with the New York City Department of Finance. The figures represent about 80% of the deeds for May that will eventually be filed during the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A year ago I would never have been able to predict the pace of new deals we are seeing, it is amazing," said Hall F. Willkie, president of the residential real estate brokerage firm Brown Harris Stevens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, he said, Brown Harris Stevens contracts signings were up 13% compared with the same month last year, and he said deals were strong in June as well. "There are new deals, and the market is popping," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, there is also considerable room for skepticism. Average prices hit a bottom in New York in the second and third quarters of last year, and have moved up a bit since then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at the time, market reports said that even as overall average prices rose, prices in most individual categories, such as studios or one-bedrooms, were flat or falling. This suggests the average price rise was due more to the changing mix of apartments sold than to a fundamental shift in the market. It isn't clear whether that pattern will recur in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And with the stock market down, and European buyers holding off because of a declining euro, worries over a worsening economy could also put a damper on a Manhattan housing recovery in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the second quarter to date, median co-op prices were up 4.8% from the previous quarter and 6.7% from the second quarter of last year. Median condo prices were up 12% from last quarter and 1.1% from the same period a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is unclear is whether Manhattan, with its huge concentration of wealth, can escape much of the housing pain long felt by the rest of the country. <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> recently forecast that national housing prices, including sales of distressed homes, would fall an additional 0.5% over the next year, before rising a bit the year after.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, an appraiser with Miller Samuel Inc., has predicted a further decline in Manhattan property values over the next three years. He cites a shadow inventory of unsold apartments, both new condominiums and resales, that haven't hit the market, and significant worries over unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dolly Lenz, a vice chairman of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said, however, that while the markets in the rest of the country have slowed, in Manhattan "the market is healthy. I am so busy I don't know what to do with myself."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, like many other brokers, she said that a few buyers had held off signing contracts at the last minute, because of fears of a declining net worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, after a year of huge price chops in listings, some asking prices are now going up. According to a listing on Streeteasy.com, Ms. Lenz took over the listing of an apartment in the Dakota, on West 72nd Street, last Friday and immediately raised the listing price by 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment was part of the estate inherited by Indra B. Tamang, a Nepalese butler, who worked for many decades for a wealthy family in the Dakota. He was willed two apartments there by Ruth Ford, a former model and actress who died last year at the age of 98.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the asking price was cut repeatedly after it was listed in December 2009, to $4.5 million from $7.5 million, Ms. Lenz raised the asking price to $4.95 million when she listed it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few days earlier, the talk-show host Conan O'Brien was reported to have found a buyer for a sprawling duplex at the Majestic, a co-op across the street from the Dakota, at or close to the $29.5 million sale price.</p>

</div><div class="author">By John Ferry </div><div>1495 words</div><div>14 June 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>In-Depth Reports</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most property investors – unless you include the hedge fund managers that shorted the market – have had their fingers burnt in the last few years. Those who invested in real-estate investment trusts suffered more than most. These vehicles often took on large amounts of debt in the lead up to the credit crunch in an attempt to turbo-charge returns. Many have since had to carry out rights issues or to cut their dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of last year some Reits were trading at discounts of up to 40% of the value of their underlying property investments – which had themselves slumped 50% from their peak – because of the bear market in equities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now many investors have finished licking their wounds and want to make up for their losses. Surprisingly, some wealthy investors are coming to the conclusion that Reits might offer them the best way to take advantage of the recovery in the property market. Reits are listed companies that manage real estate holdings, passing the profits on to shareholders. They first appeared in the U.S. in the 1960s. Many countries have since passed legislation to create their own domestic Reits markets – France saw its first Reits in 2004, for instance, while the UK got in on the act in 2007. One of Europe's biggest Reit companies is France's <span class="companylink">Unibail-Rodamco</span>, which, among other things, owns 100 shopping centres spread across 12 countries. Its property portfolio was valued at €22.3 billion at the end of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big selling point for Reits is their liquidity — they can be bought and sold just like a regular share. Another is that Reits are generally more tax efficient than other types of listed property-holding companies – with UK Reits, for instance, property income and capital gains are free from corporation tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Boom to Bust</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is easy to see why investors were so attracted to Reits when economies are booming spurring demand for commercial property space and increasing property prices. But the property boom had to end at some point. And when it did, Reits markets were hit particularly hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between February 2007 and February 2009 the FTSE EPRA/Nareit Europe Index, which tracks the performance of a diverse range of Reits listed across Europe, registered a decline of almost 75%. Reits were left reeling from a combination of debt exposure, an illiquid asset base in a falling market and an increasing cost of funding. The capital-intensive nature of the property investment business meant Reits required substantial levels of financing, which in turn meant they were particularly vulnerable to a dislocation in the credit markets. When that dislocation came and credit disappeared, Reits struggled. Their own portfolios contained illiquid assets but their structure provided investors with an easy escape route.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But easy go, easy come. Investors now realize that Reits allow them to quit the property market quickly when things take a turn for the worse. They are therefore one of the favored routes to participate in any potential recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing to keep in mind when considering Reit investments is that underlying property prices are just one of many factors that drive performance. Most Reits are focused on commercial property, which means rental rates and the general state of the economy are important to their success. The cost of lending and the availability of capital are also crucial. All things considered, real estate experts say there are reasons to be cautiously bullish on Reits at the moment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jack Foster, New York-based managing director and head of real estate at Franklin Templeton Real Estate Advisors, which invests in property funds and Reits globally, says: "We're looking through the rest of the year at a pretty strong performance from the property stock sector, and I think if you have a long term investment horizon then this is not a bad time to come into the market.".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reit companies have worked to stabilize their businesses over the last few years, which means the ones that are still around – very few actually went out of business, despite the intensity of the difficulties the sector faced – should be safer investment vehicles. "Most of the big Reits undertook rights issues to significantly bolster their balance sheets and bring in cash," says Peter Beckett, London-based director of consultancy firm <span class="companylink">Ernst &amp;Young</span>'s real estate group. "They did this partly to de-leverage and to perhaps look at refinancing some of their existing borrowings. But I think they also did it as a defensive measure. It gave them a war chest in case they had to refinance even more of their existing debt." In 2009 Reits worldwide raised tens of billions of dollars, according to <span class="companylink">Ernst &amp;Young</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Balance Sheet</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most of the Reits right now are pretty well structured from a balance sheet position," says Mr. Foster, adding that over the next two years it will be the owners of securitized real estate debt that will face more pain compared to Reits, which typically hold physical real estate. He adds: "The public property companies don't have any big problems because they know where their debt maturities are."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the big Reit operators should have the cash to allow their businesses to continue to function, while also being in a position to snap up real estate bargains. As and when those bargains present themselves however is another matter. "The equity for buying is there, but the question is: is there enough availability of good quality assets," says Kees Hage, Luxembourg-based head of consulting firm <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span>' real estate practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many banks are not willing to realize losses on property loans that are contractually in default. Instead of seizing assets then selling them on the open market, banks are stalling. "The banks at the moment are doing what the industry calls 'pretend and extend'," says Mr. Foster. "They're extending maturities on mortgages, pretending that the markets will come back enough that they won't have to realize the losses on their balance sheets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to state rescue deals, cheap central bank funding and changes in accounting rules, banks have no incentive to realize those losses. "As long as borrowers can fund their interest payments from rent then the banks are happy to let sleeping dogs lie, even though the borrower might be in breach of covenant on a loan that is technically underwater," says Mr. Beckett. "The banks don't want to end up with a lot of product they may have to sell at a potential loss, which would also make their positions worse in terms of their own capital adequacy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., for example, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility and the Public Private Investment Program were specifically put in place to prevent an expected wave of defaults. Meanwhile, accounting standards have been relaxed to let banks mark their property assets on their balance sheet at an historical cost price as opposed to an estimated current market price – which would be a lot lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even with these measures in place, most market observers expect more assets to be sold under duress over the next few years. Consultancy firm Mercer, for example, believes the greatest opportunity for Reit growth might come from a "pending" meltdown in the commercial mortgage market, according to a report it recently released called Recapitalization and Recovery in the Reit Market: "With estimates projecting over $1.2 trillion in commercial real estate loans coming due in the next four years, it is expected that some properties will be brought to the market by borrowers unable to secure additional financing or loan extensions. Capital for commercial real estate will remain tight, and with many institutional investors sidelined for the time being, Reits with balance sheet strength will be in a position to take advantage of the opportunities."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is no guarantee that the future will be all plain sailing for Reits. Much will depend on the economic recovery. A double-dip recession would spell another round of hard knocks for the sector, while growing inflationary fears could lead to higher interest rates and hence financing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the longer term the outlook for the Reits sector is also uncertain. Before the credit crisis, the Reits industry fed off the securitization cycles that pushed up asset prices. Financing on that scale will almost certainly never return. At the same time, Reits managers are likely to be more risk averse, eschewing development investment opportunities in favor of passive investments in assets with established cashflows. That suggests conservative risk and return characteristics will prevail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reits have faced a rough ride over the last few years. But the sector continues to offer investors access to an important alternative market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ronald Reagan liked to describe the sequence of actions that government typically takes toward private business: "If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. If it stops moving, subsidize it." Our government is now doing all three at the same time to America's real-estate market, and with the brilliant results you'd expect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the taxing part that represents the most immediate threat to the commercial market. Despite price declines of more than 30% in many areas since the height of the boom, commercial real estate has not become the default moonscape observed in the residential market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least not yet. But a plan passed by the House and pending in the Senate would raise "carried interest" taxes on the managers of many real-estate partnerships from the current capital gains tax rate of 15% to the top income tax rate, scheduled to hit 39.6% on January 1. Carried interest is the gain these managers receive if the assets held by the partnerships rise in value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The limited Congressional debate thus far has focused on the negative impact of this tax increase on private equity and venture capital. And the tax hike will surely reduce the incentive to invest in job-creating technology companies, among other destructive effects. But as many as half of the investments targeted by this tax would involve commercial real estate, according to the Commercial Real Estate Development Association. Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus is negotiating a complicated timetable for phasing in the tax hike, but the end result is clear: less incentive to invest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This Beltway assault on the real-estate market is remarkable, given that Washington is simultaneously spending billions of dollars to resuscitate it. Taxpayers can't possibly keep track of all the mortgage aid programs that began with George W. Bush's Hope Now Alliance and continue with Barack Obama's Home Affordable Modification Program, the home-buyer's tax credit and the special foreclosure mitigation operations of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for regulating, the thousands of pages of financial-reform bills passed by the House and Senate will impose new rules on the entire financial chain from mortgage origination to servicing to securitization to investment (except of course if your name is Fannie or Freddie).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is the tax increase on real-estate partnerships, which own most of the commercial buildings in many U.S. markets, that could have the most immediate impact. By reducing the after-tax gain that a potential manager could expect to realize, the tax increase would put downward pressure on prices in a market struggling to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to this week's Federal Reserve "beige book" report on economic conditions, "Commercial real estate activity generally remained weak." The report added that "the elevated inventory of existing properties for sale or rent continued to weigh on new private nonresidential construction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naturally, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid thinks it's about time to vote on a tax increase for the creators of such projects. He may get away with it, in part because so many in the industry are too busy trying to survive right now to worry about a rate increase. "There are no profits to tax," says New Jersey developer William Procida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But valuations are key to avoid a replay of the residential debacle in commercial property. Over the next five years, more than $1.5 trillion in commercial real-estate debt will be falling due. Without the subsidies poured into the residential market, many managers of commercial properties have aggressively responded to the downturn by raising capital, or by buying back or restructuring their debt. Now Washington arrives to impose a new burden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress and the White House have tried everything under the sun to put a floor under the housing market, but for the commercial side they seem eager to knock out the foundations. Per President Reagan's advice, could the politicians at least wait until a business is moving to start increasing taxes on it?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil Bender, heir to the William Gottlieb real-estate empire in Manhattan, is selling two downtown buildings, a rare break with his family's decades-old opposition to letting go of property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate is asking $8.5 million for a 19th-century townhouse at 79 Horatio St. The white-brick building is in a coveted meatpacking district location, near the West Village and the High Line. The building is in poor condition and would likely be condemned and require a gut renovation, according to people familiar with the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second building is in the East Village, at 104 East 10th St., with an asking price of $6 million. Both buildings were listed a week ago by Halstead Property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bender runs the estate of his uncle William Gottlieb, who started buying swaths of property in the 1950s. By the time of his death in 1999, he had accumulated more than 100 buildings in downtown Manhattan that some brokers have estimated would be valued at $1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Gottlieb estate purchased the Horatio townhouse in 2008 for $7.4 million after Mr. Bender had a falling out with the co-owner of the building, Vicky Gabay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gottlieb was famous for his "buy-and-hold" mentality, scooping up tenement buildings that were often run down and rarely parting with any of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is completely counter to William Gottlieb's philosophy," says Kevin Smith, an attorney with <span class="companylink">Stroock &amp; Stroock &amp; Lavan</span>, who represented Ms. Gabay when the Gottlieb estate bought out her share of the Horatio building at a public sale. "Selling properties like these at a time when the market has not yet come back looks like Neil Bender is trying to raise cash."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, Mr. Bender's spokeswoman, Lin-Hua Wu, said: "William Gottlieb Real Estate has long-contemplated the sale of these properties and is doing so now to take advantage of the uptick in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Gottlieb family has been feuding over the rights to the property empire for years. Last month, Mr. Bender won a victory over his sister Cheryl Dier, who alleged that he was unfit to run the estate's portfolio. A New York appellate court upheld a surrogate court ruling that Mr. Bender and his father could manage the estate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carnage in financial markets and worries about global economies have produced a new wave of nervousness among investors. But the turmoil also is creating something else -- bargains for investors with courage to do some buying of beaten-down shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An impressive triple-digit stock-market rally last Wednesday was wiped out Friday, when a disappointing report on the U.S. job market put a further dent in confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged below the psychologically important 10000 mark during Friday's frantic trading. Similar performances were logged by the Nasdaq Composite and the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500-stock index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid such market volatility, few analysts say investors should jump into the market with both feet. European economies and currencies are under heavy pressure, and worries are growing that the global economic recovery is sputtering. If European governments are unable to make headway cutting debt and improving growth, the nervousness could affect other markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, despite all the negatives, the U.S. economy is showing signs of strength. Corporate profits have been rising for five consecutive quarters; nonfinancial profits were up 6% in the past quarter. Construction and manufacturing data have been impressive lately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Having initially been driven by the financial sector in the early stages of recovery, profit growth has now broadened," says Peter Newland, an economist at <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>. "Indicators suggest that momentum is building, supported by healthy wage and profit growth."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy appears to be growing at an annualized, inflation-adjusted rate of at least 3% this quarter, amid impressive retail sales and industrial-production figures. That's respectable, though not robust, growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our baseline scenario is that events in Europe will not impact the U.S. economy in a meaningful way," says <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> economist David Greenlaw.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing seems to be stabilizing -- pending home sales rose 6% in April following a 7.1% increase in March and an 8.3% gain in February. Some of the improvement is due to the recently expired home-buyer tax credit, but tumbling mortgage rates could be another shot in the arm for the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have dumped stocks and purchased Treasury bonds, seeking safety, which has helped push 30-year mortgage rates well below 5% -- sparking a surge in mortgage refinancings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though May's employment gains were disappointing, some say better times are ahead. "The labor market is the last puzzle piece that will likely fall into place next," predicts Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Harris Private Bank in Chicago. "Temporary hiring is off the charts and given its tight relationship with the job market, we expect permanent job growth to follow close behind."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as important, stocks have been beaten down, so they now appear reasonably priced. The price/earnings ratio for companies in the S&amp;P 500 index is 13.3 based on expected earnings for 2010, suggesting stocks are attractive, some analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is rare that investors are offered such violent and quick corrections in an environment that is fundamentally improving," says market strategist Mike O'Rourke. Mr. O'Rourke is among those who argue that market pressure is forcing nations in Europe to finally take dramatic steps to curb spending and rein in debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some savvy investors, including Warren Buffett, David Tepper and Larry Fink, have issued more upbeat pronouncements in recent weeks, in part because Europe finally seems to be addressing its debt problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Paulson, a hedge-fund manager who scored $20 billion of profits in 2007 and 2008, in early May told his investors that "the outlook for 2011 could be very strong," and that housing prices could rise as much as 10% next year. In Mr. Paulson's view, the troubles in Greece and other European nations are "manageable" and won't be much of a drag on U.S. growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not to say a newly invigorated bull market is around the bend. Europe's difficulties will mean somewhat lower U.S. exports. Interest rates should remain low for the foreseeable future, but heavy government spending, which has helped boost growth, is unlikely to continue apace amid scrutiny over high levels of government debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, investors who have little in the market should use the recent selloff as a reason to edge back into certain stocks, some analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is an environment in which most investors are underexposed to U.S. equities although they offer the best combination of growth and safety for a global investor," says Mr. O'Rourke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best strategy is to stick with large, "high quality" companies, which trade at cheaper valuations than their smaller peers and could hold up better if the market has another downdraft. In fact, the 100 largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 trade at a P/E multiple of about 12.6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> is a fan of tech titan <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> (BRCM), biotech giant <span class="companylink">Amgen</span> (AMGN) and <span class="companylink">Consol Energy</span> (CNX), a coal producer that's also a favorite of George Soros's hedge fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many larger tech stocks are cash-rich and have little debt, making them stable picks in rough markets, analysts note. Some also recommend health-care shares, partly because they trade at an average P/E multiple of just 11. Larry Robbins, who manages hedge fund Glenview Capital, recently recommended health-care-related companies McKesson (MCK), <span class="companylink">Express Scripts</span> (ESRX), and Life Technologies (LIFE).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If 2000 was the peak of irrational exuberance, with investors paying for companies without earnings, today has to be the era of irrational pessimism," argues James Paulsen, chief investment officer at <span class="companylink">Wells Capital Management</span>, who recommends shares of companies in the technology and basic-materials industries.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The withdrawal of federal tax credits for home buyers led to a steeper-than-expected plunge in May home sales in much of the U.S., as the housing market struggles to wean itself from government support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists and real estate analysts expected home sales to slow after the tax credit, of as much as $8,000, expired at the end of April. But early data from real estate brokers indicate that the sales decline has been far more substantial than expected, with some markets showing declines of 25% to 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Anybody who wanted to buy a house probably did" before the tax credit deadline, said Jay Brinkmann, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association, a trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing analysts say that the May slump is ominous but that it's too early to tell whether it portends another serious downward lurch in a market that has generally been leveling off over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some recent signs have been encouraging. In April, for instance, the government reported that new-home sales, spurred by the tax credit, jumped 48% from a year earlier to an annual rate of 504,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ivy Zelman, chief executive of Zelman &amp; Associates, a research firm, estimates that sales of new homes nationwide in May were down 25% to 30% from April. She warns that the weak May performance increases the chances of renewed price cuts by builders caught with too much inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, estimated that contracts signed for home resales in May were down 20% to 30% from a year earlier. He expects June and July to remain fairly weak and will be watching nervously for signs of a rebound in August or September. "Housing cannot just depend on [government] stimulus forever," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that the housing market isn't benefiting from tax-credit "steroids, we're probably going to see a sluggish second half," said Ronald Peltier, chief executive officer of real estate broker <span class="companylink">HomeServices of America Inc</span>. Joblessness, or the fear of losing a job, continues to deter many potential buyers, Mr. Peltier said, and the large number of homes in foreclosure or heading that way is still putting downward pressure on prices in many areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HomeServices, which owns big real estate brokers in 21 states and is a unit of <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway Inc</span>., saw its home-purchase contracts signed in May fall nearly 20% from a year earlier, or about twice the decline it was expecting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-purchase contracts signed in New Jersey last month were down 25% from a year earlier, estimates Otteau Valuation Group, an appraisal firm in East Brunswick, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all kinds of goods, including houses, "people are saying, 'If it's not a great deal, I'm not going to buy it,' " said Jeffrey Otteau, chief executive of the firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey's state legislature is considering its own tax credit for home buyers. A California tax credit of as much as $10,000, which ends Dec. 31, has helped sustain sales there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A national survey of real estate agents by <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>, released Friday, shows that traffic at homes for sale was down in May to its lowest level since the financial crisis of late 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the recent drop in mortgage rates to less than 5%, applications for home-purchase mortgages in late May were down nearly 40% from a month before and have fallen to their lowest level in 13 years, according to the mortgage bankers. Though interest rates are low, many potential buyers still can't get credit because lending standards have tightened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Minneapolis area, the number of newly signed home-purchase contracts in the week ended May 22 was down 30% from a year earlier, according to the Minneapolis Area Association of Realtors. "Our buyers, if they haven't purchased, have just decided to wait," said Brad Fisher, president of the local Realtor group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Phoenix area, contracts signed in May plunged 26% from a year earlier, local Realtor data show. In Denver, the drop was 27%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another sign of weak sales, the number of homes on the market is growing again. ZipRealty Inc., Emeryville, Calif., said the number of homes listed for sale in 26 major metro areas across the U.S. in May was up 1.7% from April. In a typical May, the inventory doesn't increase from April, according to Ms. Zelman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some markets haven't suffered much from the loss of tax credits. Jonathan Miller, chief executive of Miller Samuel, a New York appraisal firm, said sales had been steady in recent weeks. Tax credits of $8,000 are tiny in comparison to typical Manhattan home prices in the millions of dollars and so had little effect there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Florida's Miami-Dade County, home-sale contracts signed in May were up nearly 5% from a year earlier, according to EWM Realtors. Many buyers in Miami are foreigners attracted by huge price cuts there over the past couple of years, said Patrick O'Connell, a senior vice president at EWM.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>, which specializes in higher-priced homes, said home-shopper visits to its communities in May were up 11% from a year ago. "At our price point, the tax credit really did not affect our business," Executive Vice President Douglas Yearley Jr. said at a conference this week.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The withdrawal of federal tax credits for home buyers led to a steeper-than-expected plunge in May home sales in much of the U.S., as the housing market struggles to wean itself from government support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists and real estate analysts expected home sales to slow after the tax credit, of as much as $8,000, expired at the end of April. But early data from real-estate brokers indicate that the sales decline has been far more substantial than expected, with some markets showing declines of 25% to 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Anybody who wanted to buy a house probably did" before the tax-credit deadline, said Jay Brinkmann, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association, a trade group.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Emily Maltby </div><div>769 words</div><div>3 June 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate prices are enticingly low in many areas of the country, prompting business owners to pursue sweet deals on storefronts, manufacturing facilities and other commercial properties. But because banks remain wary of commercial real-estate loans, landing financing to make such a purchase can be time consuming and tedious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared to peak prices in October 2007, commercial property values are down 42%, according to Moody's Investors Service Inc. Price index reports compiled by <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> and <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics Inc</span>. show that as of March 2010, the cost of industrial and office space fell 32% in the last two years. Retail space also plummeted 28%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is excess space, which opens an opportunity for small firms," says Bill Dunkelberg, chief economist at National Federation of Independent Business, a Washington advocacy group. "You won't see prices like these for a long time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some owners are heeding the call. Randy Scheidt, who heads the legislative subcommittee of the National Association of Realtor's commercial division, says that he is noticing business owners "feeling more comfortable with the future" and weighing whether "such an acquisition would be fiscally prudent."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the tight credit environment is making it difficult for entrepreneurs to secure those loans. "What is so different today versus 2006 is the underwriting scrutiny," says Mr. Scheidt. "It's not unusual for [the loan process] to take an additional 30 to 60 days."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eliot Boyle, owner of U.S. Metals LLC in Denver, decided last year to move his sheet-metal roofing and siding business to a new facility. Lease rates in the area were steady, but commercial spaces for sale on the market were falling. "We thought this was a good time to take advantage of how well we were doing and how poorly the real-estate environment was doing," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After preparing his business plan, he visited five banks and was turned down by four. The remaining lender, <span class="companylink">Bank of the West</span>, which had previously worked with Mr. Boyle, issued him a Small Business Administration loan to buy a $680,000 building. The price for the space -- a 50%-larger facility -- had dropped 40%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The process took longer than anticipated and closed one day before the scheduled move. The delays, says Mr. Boyle, stemmed from the bank's requirement of additional environmental reports and other due diligence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All those appraisals showed that . . . if the bank needs to move fast and has to liquidate the building quickly, it can do that," says Mr. Boyle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The approval timelines are really not that different than they were in the past," says Jim Cole, spokesperson for the San Francisco-based <span class="companylink">Bank of the West</span>. "Appraisals take the same amount of time and, as always, environmental reports can take longer than expected."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many banks taking extra precaution before issuing commercial mortgages are reeling from those kinds of losses and are wary of putting more of those loans on their books. According to a <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>' study of <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. and bank data, the default rate for commercial real-estate mortgages rose to 4.2%, amounting to $45.5 billion, for the first quarter of 2010. That's the highest default rate since 1992.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial real estate loans have really hurt community and regional banks, which are key lenders to small businesses. They hold just more than half of bank-issued commercial mortgages and their portfolios are likely to hurt for some time. The default trend is expected to continue through 2011, when it may hit 5.4%, before abating, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the commercial real estate market has shown some tentative signs of life in the early months of 2010, there is little transparency about the value of many properties, says Sam Chandan, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. Appraisals help determine price, he explains, but commercial property values are supported by other transactions in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To overcome the credit challenge, experts say entrepreneurs can make themselves more attractive by submitting sound financial plans that back up their income projections and intent to repay the loan. Borrowers with solid credit histories and established bank relationships are more likely to get a loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chandan says newer businesses can still land financing if they can bring equity to the table, especially if the borrower wants to purchase a vacant property that the bank is holding. But, he cautions, "lending standards have tightened considerably, so it will be challenging."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK—Stocks rose broadly Wednesday, led by the energy sector as investors viewed the recent declines in companies such as Halliburton, <span class="companylink">Baker Hughes</span> and <span class="companylink">Exxon Mobil</span> as overdone, while a better-than-expected report on pending home sales also boosted sentiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 225.52 points, or 2.2%, to 10249.54, its third-biggest one-day gain this year. However, the measure is still down 8.5% from its 2010 closing high, reached in late April, and is off 1.7% for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the Dow's top performers Wednesday, <span class="companylink">American Express</span> jumped $1.78, or 4.5%, to $40.97, and <span class="companylink">Walt Disney</span> added 1.41, or 4.2%, to 34.74. The chairman of <span class="companylink">Disney</span>'s consumer-products business said the company is targeting $50 billion in retail sales within the next five to seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow's energy components also were particularly strong, with <span class="companylink">Exxon Mobil</span> rising 1.52, or 2.6%, to 60.77, and <span class="companylink">Chevron</span> up 1.84, or 2.6%, to 74.13. The stocks had been beaten down with the rest of the sector in recent weeks as crude-oil futures have fallen and worries over the BP oil spill have increased. Wednesday, investors were buying, and even American depositary shares of BP, which isn't a Dow component, rose 1.14, or 3.1%, to 37.66.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nasdaq Composite rose 58.74, or 2.6%, to 2281.07. <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index advanced 27.67, or 2.6%, to 1098.38, and all its sectors ended the session solidly higher, led by energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leading the energy sector's gains, Halliburton jumped 2.53, or 12%, to 23.68, and <span class="companylink">Baker Hughes</span> climbed 3.76, or 10%, to 39.63. Halliburton, which performed the cementing job and other services related to the development of BP's blown-out deep-water well, said Wednesday it expects to be fully indemnified from all claims and expenses resulting from the oil spill moving through the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Jay Wong, equity portfolio manager at Payden &amp; Rygel, said he is still concerned about how oil-related companies could be affected by any potential regulatory changes that stem from the oil spill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What this oil spill is going to do is affect oil regulation tremendously, which is going to affect all of the oil companies," Mr. Wong said. He added that, ultimately, the sector's profitability could be hurt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's gains in U.S. stocks came as data showed U.S. pending home sales rose in April beyond expectations, thanks in part to a tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's just another piece of strong economic data that shows that we are in fact continuing to recover economically," Mr. Wong said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wong said investors were also encouraged by the cheaper valuations that were in the market following Tuesday's drop. He added, "the perspective is that maybe this is a great long-term buying opportunity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Ford Motor</span> added 44 cents, or 3.9%, to 11.85. The auto maker posted a 22% increase in May U.S. light-vehicle sales as it benefited from high demand for its crossovers and trucks, as well as strong fleet sales. Ford also slightly boosted its second-quarter production target by 15,000 vehicles to 640,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Amgen</span> (Nasdaq) jumped 5.33, or 11%, to 56.09. The drug company received Food and Drug Administration approval for its Prolia treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, a decision that comes almost two months earlier than expected. Oppenheimer forecasts global sales of the drug could reach more than $2 billion a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American depositary shares of Gerdau rose 59 cents, or 4.5%, to 13.82, after the company gave <span class="companylink">Gerdau Ameristeel</span>'s board of directors a proposal to buy the one-third stake of the minimill steel producer it doesn't already own for $1.6 billion. Ameristeel's board of directors has unanimously agreed that it would support a deal at the $11-a-share proposal price. <span class="companylink">Gerdau AmeriSteel</span> surged 3.90, or 54%, to 11.07.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Alexion Pharmaceuticals</span> (Nasdaq) advanced 3.50, or 7.2%, to 52.34. The company raised its full-year earnings forecast, noting it plans to launch its flagship blood-disorder treatment in Japan three months earlier than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Continental Airlines</span> climbed 2.25, or 11%, to 22.54, after data released by the airline showed it continued to accelerate its gains in a key measure of profitability for carriers in May, as its traffic also returned to growth last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American depositary shares of <span class="companylink">Novo Nordisk</span> rose 3.52, or 4.7%, to 79.28. The Danish pharmaceutical company said it will launch diabetes treatment Victoza in Japan in June, as the country's authorities have now approved the price of the drug.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">E*Trade Financial</span> (Nasdaq) rose 79 cents, or 5.6%, to 14.99, following the online brokerage's reverse stock split. The measure moved the stock out of the sub-$2 level and cut its number of authorized shares outstanding to 400 million from four billion. E*Trade's 1-for-10 stock split combines 10 shares of issued and outstanding common stock into one share of common stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Monsanto</span> climbed 1.60, or 3.3%, to 50.37, after <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> upgraded its investment rating on the fertilizer company's stock to "conviction buy" from "neutral," saying the "bad news is exhausted." <span class="companylink">Monsanto</span> has been the second-worst performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 this year, the firm noted, adding that any positive news from U.S. harvest results beginning in September provide a lift.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for U.S. Treasury debt edged lower Wednesday as better U.S. economic data came up against ongoing concerns about euro-zone debt and word that Japan's prime minister had resigned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite investors' desire for safe assets, Treasurys weakened in response to better-than-expected U.S. housing data, and as market participants began to anticipate Friday's nonfarm payrolls report, which is expected to show the U.S. gained more than 500,000 jobs in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At midday in New York, the 10-year Treasury note was bid at 101 19/32, down 4/32, to yield 3.3105%. The two-year note was down 1/32 at 99 29/32, yielding 0.7975%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market "is looking forward to a pretty healthy payroll number Friday and wants to cheapen up ahead of the data," said Rick Klingman, managing director of trading at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasurys, however, "are trading fairly well considering that we've had decent data for two days in a row," Mr. Klingman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data Wednesday showed pending home sales rose more than expected in April as buyers signed contracts to collect a government tax credit. Pending home sales rose by 6%, their third gain in a row, versus expectations for a 5% rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, reports showed that U.S factory activity expanded by more than expected and construction spending in April registered the biggest gain in nearly 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Klingman said that Treasury prices would likely be a lot lower Wednesday if it weren't for continued concerns about euro-zone debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short-term funding markets were under pressure Wednesday as worries about euro-zone banks rolled on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of borrowing dollars for three months in the interbank market rose; data from the British Bankers' Association showed that three-month U.S. dollar Libor rose to 0.53750% from 0.53625% on Tuesday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thor, which owns stores, office buildings and other commercial real estate in New York and other cities, is close to edging out other bidders, including <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span> and <span class="companylink">SL Green Realty</span>, these people said. The building, between 54th and 55th streets, has about 100,000 square feet of space and is being marketed by <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bids come as interest in Fifth Avenue retail is heating up even as questions about the health of New York's broader commercial market remain. In April, a partnership led by the Carlyle Group began leasing 666 Fifth Ave. and Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo agreed to pay $300 million over 15 years, one of the most expensive leases ever in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sitt couldn't be reached for comment. A native of Brooklyn, he has been active in a wide range of retail businesses, including Ashley Stewart, the <span class="companylink">Children's Place</span> and Kidspot. Thor has a commercial real estate portfolio totaling more than 12 million square feet and valued at more than $3 billion, according to the firm's Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sitt also is one of the largest private owners of Coney Island property and is working on plans to develop year-round retail and entertainment uses on it. Last year, he sold seven acres to the city which also is envisioning more development of the historic amusement district.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James B. Stewart SmartMoney </div><div>794 words</div><div>2 June 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I didn't get into a mall this holiday weekend, but I drove by several, and their lots were reassuringly full. At an antiques fair in upstate New York, dealers said sales were brisk, especially compared with last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These may be random observations, but they suggest that Europe's recent woes and volatility in the stock market haven't damped consumer confidence in the U.S. The Conference Board reported last week that its index of consumer confidence in the U.S. grew in May for the third month in a row. That reinforces my view that the slump in commercial real estate, including shopping malls and office complexes, has likely bottomed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week I reported that I used the recent correction to invest in commercial real estate, a sector I had avoided since the collapse of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> and ensuing recession. Recent data suggest that property values are stabilizing. Unlike most hapless subprime borrowers, many big real estate borrowers have the wherewithal to get banks to refinance and avoid outright defaults. I think the worst is likely over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many investment professionals, including many endowment managers, advocate an allocation to real estate as part of a broad diversification strategy. Historically real estate has provided a hedge against inflation as well as a cushion against volatility, since it hasn't been highly correlated with equities. That wasn't the case during the 2008-09 plunge, when real estate prices collapsed along with virtually every other asset class. But I still believe the long-term case for diversification makes sense, and I'm aiming for a 5% commitment to real estate. (I'll increase that if prices correct further.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Direct investment and real estate partnerships don't make sense for any but the wealthiest individuals and institutions, since minimum commitments are high and the investments are illiquid. But the rapid rise of real-estate investment trusts, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds have made it easy for individuals to gain access to low-minimum, low-cost, highly diversified real estate portfolios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I put equal amounts into two REIT ETFs: The Vanguard REIT Index ETF for U.S. real estate and the SPDR Dow Jones International Real Estate ETF. There are many other options, but the Vanguard ETF is large, actively traded, very liquid, and boasts a low expense ratio -- just 0.13%, compared to the 0.52% real estate ETF average. It seeks to replicate the MSCI US REIT Index. I examined the holdings in several of these broad-based real estate ETFs, and they all own essentially the same REITs, with broad exposure to office buildings, shopping malls, apartment complexes, storage facilities and hotels. The Vanguard ETF's largest holding is large mall operator <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group</span>, considered one of the best-run REITs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SPDR Dow Jones ETF, run by <span class="companylink">State Street Global Advisors</span>, is also large, liquid and actively traded. Expenses, at 0.59%, are slightly higher than average. The fund tracks the performance of the Dow Jones Global ex-U.S. Select Real Estate Securities Index, which is heavily weighted toward developed Asia and Europe, with little exposure to China and other emerging markets. (I couldn't find an ETF that focuses exclusively on emerging markets real estate, though there is one for China real estate.) The ETF's largest holding is Australia-based <span class="companylink">Westfield Group</span>, one of the world's largest mall operators. But strictly speaking, it isn't a pure play on foreign real estate, since Westfield is a major owner and operator of U.S. properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both of these ETFs have relatively low exposure to hotels and resorts, which I believe should continue to benefit from increased business and leisure travel. So I also bought shares in <span class="companylink">Starwood Hotels and Resorts</span> Worldwide. It isn't a REIT, but in many ways it might as well be. Its brands include Westin, St. Regis, W, Le Meridien and Sheraton. It's highly diversified, with properties all over the world. It was also recently trading at more than 20% off its intraday high for the year of $56.65.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course risks remain, especially given the recent jitters over Europe's debt load and the possible fragile recovery. But prices of REITs and other real estate assets have recently corrected, in most cases more than the broad market. To me, that makes an inviting entry point.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Energy companies led a decline in stocks Tuesday, as BP's mounting troubles, including U.S. civil and criminal investigations announced late in the session, rattled investors already worried about a global economic slowdown and its potential impact on companies such as <span class="companylink">Alcoa</span> and Caterpillar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concerns ultimately outweighed better-than-expected reports on U.S. construction spending and manufacturing that had boosted stocks earlier in Tuesday's session.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 112.61 points, or 1.1%, to 10024.02.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caterpillar, which has benefited much in recent quarters from its overseas exposures, dropped 1.49, or 2.5%, to 59.27.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy companies were particularly weak. <span class="companylink">Chevron</span> dropped 1.58, or 2.1%, to 72.29, and <span class="companylink">Exxon Mobil</span> declined 1.21, or 2%, to 59.25.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jeff Bater                And Meena Thiruvengadam   </div><div>500 words</div><div>2 June 2010</div><div>17:31</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. pending home sales rose in April beyond expectations as buyers signed contracts to collect a government tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' index for pending sales of used homes increased by 6.0% to 110.9 in April, the industry group said Wednesday. The gain was the third in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected pending home sales would climb in April by 5.0%. First-time home-buyers rushed to beat the April 30 deadline for the tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incentive was an extension of a subsidy originally enacted in February 2009. Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, said sales this spring seem as strong as those last fall, before the original expiration date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There were concerns that only a small pool of buyers were left to take advantage of the tax credit extension," he said. "But evidently the tax stimulus, combined with improved consumer confidence and low mortgage interest rates, are contributing to surging sales."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year-over-year, the index was 22.4% above its level of 90.6 in April 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">March pending home sales were revised up, with the index rising 7.1% to 104.6. Originally, NAR said the gauge rose 5.3% to 102.9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR index is based on pending sales of existing homes, including single-family homes and condominiums. A home sale is pending when the contract has been signed but the transaction hasn't closed. Pending sales typically close within one or two months of signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts have expressed fear the housing market will suffer with the end of the government subsidy. But the job market has been improving. The Labor Department is scheduled this week to release employment data for May, and economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires are expecting a gain of 515,000 non-farm payroll jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its monthly forecast on the industry, the NAR projected existing-home sales of 5.39 million this year and 5.66 million in 2011. That compares with 5.16 million in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market has to get back on its own feet and now appears to be in a good position to return to sustainable levels even without government stimulus, provided the economy continues to add jobs," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from low mortgage rates, historically low prices have helped sales, too. The median price for an existing home is estimated at $174,500 in 2010 and $180,400 in 2011. It was $172,500 in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, pending sales in the Northeast rose 29.5% in April and were 24.5% higher than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Midwest increased 4.1% in April and were 17.9% higher than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales in the South fell 0.6% in April but were 31.3% above the level a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The West rose 7.5% in April and were 12.0% higher than a year earlier.</p>

Historically real estate has provided a hedge against inflation as well as a cushion against volatility, since it hasn't been highly correlated with equities. That wasn't the case during the 2008-09 plunge, when real estate prices collapsed along with virtually every other asset class. But I still believe the long-term case for diversification makes sense, and I'm aiming for a 5% commitment to real estate. (I'll increase that if prices correct further.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Direct investment and real estate partnerships don't make sense for any but the wealthiest individuals and institutions, since minimum commitments are high and the investments are illiquid. But the rapid rise of real-estate investment trusts, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds have made it easy for individuals to gain access to low-minimum, low-cost, highly diversified real estate portfolios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I put equal amounts into two REIT ETFs: The Vanguard REIT Index ETF for U.S. real estate and the SPDR Dow Jones International Real Estate ETF. There are many other options, but the Vanguard ETF is large, actively traded, very liquid, and boasts a low expense ratio—just 0.13%, compared to the 0.52% real estate ETF average. It seeks to replicate the MSCI US REIT Index. I examined the holdings in several of these broad-based real estate ETFs, and they all own essentially the same REITs, with broad exposure to office buildings, shopping malls, apartment complexes, storage facilities and hotels. The Vanguard ETF's largest holding is large mall operator <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group</span>, considered one of the best-run REITs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SPDR Dow Jones ETF, run by <span class="companylink">State Street Global Advisors</span>, is also large, liquid and actively traded. Expenses, at 0.59%, are slightly higher than average. The fund tracks the performance of the Dow Jones Global ex-U.S. Select Real Estate Securities Index, which is heavily weighted toward developed Asia and Europe, with little exposure to China and other emerging markets. (I couldn't find an ETF that focuses exclusively on emerging markets real estate, though there is one for China real estate.) The ETF's largest holding is Australia-based <span class="companylink">Westfield Group</span>, one of the world's largest mall operators. But strictly speaking, it isn't a pure play on foreign real estate, since Westfield is a major owner and operator of U.S. properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both of these ETFs have relatively low exposure to hotels and resorts, which I believe should continue to benefit from increased business and leisure travel. So I also bought shares in <span class="companylink">Starwood Hotels and Resorts</span> Worldwide. It isn't a REIT, but in many ways it might as well be. Its brands include Westin, St. Regis, W, Le Meridien and Sheraton. It's highly diversified, with properties all over the world. It was also recently trading at more than 20% off its intraday high for the year of $56.65.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course risks remain, especially given the recent jitters over Europe's debt load and the possible fragile recovery. But prices of REITs and other real estate assets have recently corrected, in most cases more than the broad market. To me, that makes an inviting entry point.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. stock market gave back early gains and struggled near the flatline Wednesday afternoon, weighed down by a pullback in the energy sector after the "top kill" by BP failed to stanch the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other sectors were bolstered by strong economic data. U.S. construction spending in April registered its biggest gain in nearly 10 years, and manufacturing activity expanded by more than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After briefly dipping into the red, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 19.42 points, or 0.2%, at 10156.05 in early-afternoon trade. The blue-chip measure was up nearly 100 points at its morning high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 0.1% to 2254.08, and the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500-stock index was off 0.3% at 1085.70, pulled down by a 1.7% slide in its energy sector. But the broad index's losses were tempered by slight gains in its technology, telecommunications, consumer-staples and health-care sectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BP's American depositary shares were down 12%. BP said Tuesday that it is working on deploying a so-called lower marine riser package containment system to halt the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, but as with other attempts by BP, the system has never been attempted at 5,000 feet under water. Transocean, the operator of the oil rig that exploded, fell 7.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nymex crude for July delivery was down 63 cents at $73.34 a barrel in midday trade, in a volatile session.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European markets</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European stocks ended broadly flat Tuesday, staging a late recovery as the better-than-expected U.S. economic data propelled regional indexes higher, offsetting earlier losses on worries that the euro-zone debt crisis would hurt the region's banking system and derail a global recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pan-European Stoxx 600 Index closed 0.2% higher at 245.34, but the U.K.'s FTSE 100 fell 0.5% to 5163.30. France's CAC-40 dropped 0.1% to 3503.08, and Frankfurt's DAX added 0.3% to 5981.27.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil and gas stocks suffered the brunt of the selling, led lower by BP, which fell 13% in London. The European Stoxx 600 index for the oil and gas sector dropped 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banking shares were pressured after the European Central Bank said Monday that the euro zone will suffer "considerable" loan losses this year and next. The European Stoxx 600 banks index lost 0.2%, above earlier lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spain's Banco Santander dropped 1.5%, while Italian banking group <span class="companylink">Unicredit</span> fell 4.5%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Treasury prices were mixed Monday after strong initial gains, as demand for safe assets eased following better-than-forecast U.S. economic data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond prices fell from session highs as the key monthly gauge of the manufacturing sector in May declined less than economists had forecast, while construction spending for April posted the biggest gain in nearly 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data partly offset worries that the euro zone's sovereign-debt crisis would undermine the health of the region's banking system and pose a threat to the global economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midday, the 10-year note was up 7/32 to 101 29/32 to yield 3.276%, but the 30-year bond was down 13/32 to 103 3/32 to 4.193%. The two-year note was up 1/32 to 99 31/32 to yield 0.774%. Bond yields move inversely to prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There remains little doubt in our mind that the pace of expansion will slow in the second half of the year, but the idea that the U.S. economy has grown only because of fiscal and monetary stimulus is an idea with which we continue to disagree," said Dan Greenhaus, chief economic and bond strategist at Miller, Tabak &amp;Co in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury prices initially gained after the European Central Bank said Monday that banks in the euro zone will suffer "considerable" loan losses this year and next, which could amount to an additional 195 billion euros ($240 billion) in write-downs and weigh on banks' profitability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. markets were closed Monday for the Memorial Day holiday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S manufacturing index from the Institute for Supply Management was 59.7 in May, down from April's 60.4. But economists have expected a reading of 58.7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, spending on construction in the U.S. rose in April unexpectedly, as the commercial sector posted a promising increase and the housing industry stormed forward on a government subsidy.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK—Prices of most Treasury securities posted small gains Tuesday on the first trading session of June, with worries over the euro zone's debt crisis supporting demand for safe assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market gave up most of the rally, however, after the mid-morning release of upbeat U.S. economic data in manufacturing and construction spending. The 30-year Treasurys were the best performers; the two-year note saw early gains erased in late-afternoon trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We get a bid overnight but don't share the same jitters with the Europeans to carry it on," said David Ader, head of government bond strategy at CRT Capital Group LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of 3:37 p.m. EDT, the 10-year note was 5/32 higher, with the yield down 0.018 percentage point at 3.285%, and the 30-year bond was 11/32 higher, pushing down the yield by 0.02 percentage point to 4.196%. The two-year note's yield was flat at 0.786%. Bond yields move inversely to prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mary Ann Hurley, vice president of trading in Seattle at <span class="companylink">D.A. Davidson &amp; Co</span>., cautioned that it may take a while to measure the impact of the euro zone's debt crisis on the U.S. economic outlook, which means trading in financial markets is likely to continue to be volatile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is still a very nervous market, with the bond market trading at very lofty price levels," said Hurley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The uncertainty over the global economic outlook was heightened Tuesday following data showing manufacturing growth in China, one of the main engines for the world economy, slowed more than forecast while the unemployment rate in the euro zone rose to the highest level in almost 12 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to concern over the health of the euro zone's banking system, the European Central Bank warned on Monday that banks in the region will suffer "considerable" loan losses this year and next, which could amount to an additional €195 billion ($240 billion) in write-downs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Investors are fearing the worst as headlines across the globe are worsening especially as it relates to the Europe," said Tom di Galoma, head of U.S. rates trading at <span class="companylink">Guggenheim Partners</span> in New York. "People are worried that Europe's contagion spreads to our shores slowing growth and raising the chances of a second dip in the economy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> struck a cautious tone Tuesday after lifting its overnight target rate by 0.025 percentage point to 0.50% to tame the risks of inflation. The first major central bank to raise interest rates over the past two years, the BOC made it clear it will weigh global and domestic developments carefully, including the euro zone's problems, before raising interest rates again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year Treasury yield, the benchmark for consumer and corporate borrowing, dipped to as low as 3.059% last week, the weakest level since April 2009. The yield fell more than 30 basis points last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury market handed investors a return of 1.71% in May, boosting the return so far this year to 3.93%, according to data from <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>. That was quite a turnaround from the loss of 3.57% in 2009, when the market was weighed down by concern over the avalanche of government debt supply and U.S.'s unprecedentedly high budget shortfall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the moment, the euro zone's debt crisis has sparked global investors to seek shelter in the dollar and Treasurys, with concerns over the U.S.'s own fiscal challenges into the back burner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But William O'Donnell, head of U.S. government bond strategy at RBS Securities Inc. in Stamford, Conn., said the Treasury market is overbought in the short term, highlighting the risk of a near-term bull-market correction to higher yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Donnell notes that the 10-year note's yield has been unable to close below 3.175% since May 15, 2009, despite nine attempts to do so since then. But long term, the yield is likely to go lower, he said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—Despite declines since the bursting of the bubble in 2007, European house prices are still too high and may fall again later this year or in 2011, credit ratings agency <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the exception of Germany, house prices in most European nations rose sharply between 1999 and 2007, before falling back in response to the financial crisis and the economic recession it engendered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report, S&amp;P said the fall in house prices is slowing, while in the U.K., prices started rising again in November of last year. But using long-term measures of value such as the ratio of house prices to rental incomes and to incomes, S&amp;P said house prices in many nations are overvalued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We may not yet have witnessed a full correction of some of the imbalances that the 1999-2007 housing bubble created," S&amp;P said. "If so, we think prices could take a second dip later this year or in early 2011."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A renewed decline in house prices could further retard Europe's already-weak economic recovery by weakening consumer spending and raising losses on mortgage loans made by European banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P said one trigger for such declines may be a rise in the yields on euro-zone government bonds, against which mortgage loans are priced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ratings agency said French house prices are the most clearly overvalued, having fallen by just 8% from their peak in the first quarter of 2008. In the eight years leading up to that peak, French house prices rose 118%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A look at those markets that seem to still display signs of froth shows that France firmly leads the pack on the overvaluation side," S&amp;P said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spanish house prices have fallen much more sharply from their peak, but S&amp;P said they may fall further, and by as much as 12.5%. That would be bad news for the nation's savings banks, which are already facing difficulties as a result of aggressive lending during the decade-long property boom, which led to the construction of hundreds of thousands of homes that remain unoccupied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, 12 of Spain's 45 savings banks have begun merger talks, and a 13th has been rescued by the central bank. The troubled sector, which had long resisted government pressure to merge, now is bowing to the inevitable, hastened by the Bank of Spain's willingness to take over ailing lenders and by new rules it has proposed that would require all Spanish banks to speed up the recognition of losses from bad loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think the adjustment in the housing market will likely continue for at least another year," S&amp;P said. "The pace of declining house prices will likely continue to ease...but it will take at least another year before the market achieves sustainable stabilization."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ireland also experienced a boom in the construction of new homes fueled by cheap credit over the decade to 2007. House prices have fallen very sharply since their peak and continue to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P said that "the market appears undervalued today," but it nevertheless forecast a further 10% drop before prices bottom out in 2011, driven lower by weak mortgage lending, a glut of unsold homes, the continuing recession and high rates of unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ratings agency said the outlook for U.K. house prices is less clear, with some measures indicating that the market is undervalued and some that it is overvalued. "This could mean another correction is in the offing," S&amp;P said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, it added that the most likely outcome is that house prices continue to rise in coming quarters, albeit slowly. In contrast to Ireland and Spain, the strong rise in U.K. house prices in the decade leading up to 2007 wasn't associated with a boom in home construction. And with the nation's population increasing, the result is that the U.K. suffers from "a chronic shortage of dwellings."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Price contractions associated with the current downturn in the U.K. market are probably over for the most part...but the pace of house price growth is likely to slow markedly in the coming quarters," S&amp;P said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European stocks ended broadly flat Tuesday, staging a late recovery as gains on Wall Street following some better-than-expected U.S. economic data propelled regional indexes higher, offsetting earlier losses on worries that the euro-zone debt crisis would hurt the region's banking system and derail a global recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As European markets closed, the Dow Jones Industrials Average was 0.1% higher at 10147.74, helped by data which showed U.S. construction spending in April posted its biggest gain in nearly 10 years and U.S. manufacturing activity expanded by more than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This helped share markets in Europe recover from earlier losses, which were triggered by the euro hitting a fresh four-year low against the dollar amid ongoing concerns over the sovereign-debt crisis in the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the pan-European Stoxx 600 Index closed 0.1% higher at 245.34, but the U.K.'s FTSE 100 ended 0.5% lower at 5163.20. France's CAC-40 was off 0.1% at 3503.08 and Frankfurt's DAX added 0.3% to 5981.27.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar took advantage of better-than-expected U.S. data, and the euro recovered from an overnight four-year low against the greenback as market sentiment improved on the U.S. data. Late in Europe, the euro was at $1.2273 from $1.2306 late Monday in Toronto, while dollar was at ¥91.15 from ¥91.27, late Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., construction spending rose 2.7% in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $869.09 billion compared to the prior month, the Commerce Department. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected no change. The increase in April was the second unexpected gain in construction spending and the highest since August 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also boosting sentiment, the Institute for Supply Management reported its May manufacturing index moved to a reading of 59.7, from 60.4 in April and 59.6 in March, better than the 58.7 expected by economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the positive tone from U.S, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas</span> Tuesday said that its general business-activity index for factories in its district moved to 2.9, from 21.1 in April and 7.2 in March. The production index came in at 20.8 from 18.2 the month before. Despite the cooling in the overall index, the details of the release were generally positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, worse-than-expected Chinese economic data stoked fears earlier that the recovery could be on fragile footing, with concerns around inflation and overheating persisting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding further pressure, the European Central Bank said Monday, that the euro-zone will suffer "considerable" loan losses this year and next, which could amount to an additional €195 billion in write-downs and weigh on banks' profitability. The pan-European Stoxx 600 banks index lost 0.2% at 194.11, off earlier lows around 188.85.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, oil and gas stocks suffered the brunt of the selling, led lower by the U.K.'s BP, which fell 13% amid ongoing concerns about the company's inability to plug the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico after it emerged over the weekend that its latest attempt has failed. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index for the oil &amp; gas sector dropped 2.0% to 296.24</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking ahead, the U.S. employment report Friday will be closely watched for further clues on how the world's largest economy is faring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Asia, stock markets ended lower Tuesday, with some investors selling shares on the hints of a slowdown in China's economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the oil market, light, sweet crude for July delivery traded around 65 cents lower at $73.32 per barrel on the New York Mercantile exchange and gold for June delivery was around 1.1% higher to $1,225.70 an ounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In major market action: Miners, which are closely tied to Chinese demand trends were pressured, with BHP Billiton down 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lender Santander dropped 1.6%, while Italian banking group <span class="companylink">Unicredit</span> fell 4.7% as concerns about the health of the European banking sector continued to weigh on sentiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Autos, which rely on consumer spending, were lower, with Fiat shares down 1.9% and Renault down 1.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday the seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate across the 16-nation euro zone rose to 10.1% in April from 10% in March, the European Union statistics agency Eurostat reported. Economists had expected the rate to hold steady at 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were a handful of strong gainers on Tuesday, however, with life insurer Prudential up 6.3%. <span class="companylink">American International Group</span> said Tuesday that it wouldn't accept a lowered offer of $30.38 billion for its Asian operations, leaving its deal with U.K. life insurer Prudential on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Irish low-cost airline <span class="companylink">Ryanair</span> advanced 7.5%. Europe's largest no-frills airline declared its first dividend since it went public more than 10 years ago, as lower fuel costs and solid traffic growth helped it return to an annual profit.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan's Financial District is known as the home of Wall Street, not a residential destination. But it also has become just that. Today below Chambers Street, there are 27,881 residential units and 55,000 residents, up from 13,901 units and 24,400 residents in 2000, according to the Alliance for Downtown New York. Additions have come from both new apartment towers and conversions of obsolete office buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the Financial District now has high-end homes, such as the Cipriani Club Residences and the Setai, as well as its own acronym that some say was coined by developer Kent Swig: FiDi. This weekend, somespots are having open houses that people interested in living south of City Hall might consider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers in the area are often foreigners who buy pied-a-terre or investment units that they rent out, but the financial district also attracts families. Schools in the area include Millennium High School, with about 550 students and partnerships with groups like the Battery Dance Company and the YMCA Future Works Entrepreneurship Program. The Claremont Preparatory School, a private, nonsectarian school with about 800 students in pre-kindergarten through ninth grade, will open a high school this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because it's a nontraditional neighborhood, the area has been known for offering buyers more space for the money. But some brokers point out that right now bargains are available in other neighborhoods, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jacky Teplitzky of Prudential Douglas Elliman says she finds it difficult to recommend the Financial District to her clients when there are good finds available in more established communities. The Financial District still has much work to do before gaining the after-hours vibrancy of other areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there has been some progress. In recent years, Stone Street has emerged as a center of dining and nightlife, especially during pleasant weather when the cobblestone street is crowded with alfresco diners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-end retailers like Tiffany and Hermes have opened, along with supermarkets, dry cleaners and other amenities. John Street features Bon Chon Chicken, Open Door Gastropub and Cafe Sage, a trio of restaurants with sleek interiors. The adventurous might stumble across the Iron Horse, a biker bar and restaurant, complete with two motorcycles out front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's still quiet, but it's not as quiet as it used to be," says Danielle Lewis McLaurin of <span class="companylink">Charles Rutenberg Realty</span>. "Before, it was just desolate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neighborhood by the Numbers</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PROLOGUE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday, a piece of my house came off in my hands. I don't mean that metaphorically. I banged the garbage can against an outside wall, and a piece of stucco about the size of a sheet of paper came ever so slightly loose. When I touched it, it fell gently into my palm. It was as if the house were giving me a lock of its hair, or perhaps coughing up phlegm. I was concerned, but it also happened that I was really busy that day. I just couldn't get into it with the stucco, not right then anyway. Also, I was coming up on my five-year anniversary of owning the house, and if there's anything I've learned in five years, it's this: if a piece of your house falls off and you don't know what to do with it, throwing it in the trash and forgetting about it is a perfectly viable option. And it so happened that the trash can was right there. Once upon a time I would have made a beeline to the yellow pages to look up "stucco replacement," but I've come a long way since then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So has the house. I bought it in 2004, and as I write this, it's supposedly worth $100,000 less than what I paid for it. By the time you read this, it will probably be worth even less than that. I try not to care because if I cared too much, or even thought about it too much, I'd go insane. I've spent enough time here being insane, believe me. I was insane when I bought the place, and I went even more insane afterward. Then again, the whole world was high a few years ago. The whole world, or at least the whole country, was buying real estate and melting it down to liquid form and then injecting it into veins. For my part, it's tempting to say I succumbed to peer pressure, but it was really much more complicated than that. There is no object of desire quite like a house. Few things in this world are capable of eliciting such urgent, even painful, yearning. Few sentiments are at once as honest and as absurd as the one that moves us to declare: "Life would be perfect if I lived in that house."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm writing this book in homage to that sentiment, which is to say I'm telling the story of a very imperfect life lived among very imperfect houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A large part of that story, of course, involves the house that is now falling apart in my hands, the gist of which is basically this: In 2004, I was among the nearly six million Americans who purchased real estate. Like roughly a quarter of them, I was a single woman (single men don't buy houses nearly as often), and I was making the leap for the first time. Again, this was a time when the real estate market had reached a frenzy that surpassed even the tech boom of the mid-1990s. It was scarcely possible back then to attend a party or even get your teeth cleaned without falling into a conversation about real estate: its significance, its desirability, its increasing aura of unattainability. My dental hygienist, for example, had robust opinions about reverse mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many of my friends and neighbors, I attended so many open houses and made such a complete study of the Multiple Listing Service that the homes on the market seemed like human beings. We discussed the quirks and prices of these properties as though we were gossiping about our neighbors. At the risk of making a perverse and offensive comparison, I truly don't think I'd observed so much absorption with one topic since the attacks of September 11, 2001. As in those chilling days, we could literally speak of nothing else. People who had never put a thought toward home ownership were being seduced by record-low interest rates and "creative" financing plans. People who'd happily owned their homes for years were doubling and tripling their equity and suddenly realizing they could cash out or trade up. If the jolt of the fall of 2001 had rocked our sense of safety to the nub, the real estate craze that followed a few years later gave us a reason to wager that the very notion of security, at least the kind made of four walls and a roof, was something that could be purchased, often without good credit or a down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As caught up in all this static as I was, none of these factors had much to do with the reason I depleted most of my savings to buy a nine-hundred-square-foot bungalow for more than four times the money my parents had paid for the two-story, four-bedroom house I grew up in. At the time, I might have said otherwise. I probably insisted (I say "probably" since, as with all major life decisions, the relevant details tend to get lost in the mix; I do, however, remember the outfit I was wearing—a tank top with a strange and rather awful floralpatterned skirt—when I signed the escrow papers) that I was making an investment, that I was "putting my money in the safest place," that I was tired of dealing with landlords. All of that was true, but it was only years later that I could see there was something else going on entirely. I bought the house because I was thirty-four years old, had been self-employed most of my adult life, had never been married, was childless, had no boyfriend nor any appealing prospects in that department, and was hungry to the point of weakness for something that would root me to the earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, that's as good a list as any of reasons not to buy a house. Freelance writers haven't historically been the best risks for mortgage lenders, and the absence of a romantic life, be it by choice, circumstance, or a narcissistic refusal to participate in Internet dating (which I suppose counted as a choice), doesn't on the surface seem relevant to the acquisition of property. But most people have a hard time separating the self from the home, and I was no exception. More than just shelter for ourselves and for our loved ones, more than just "the biggest purchase you'll ever make," a house is a repository for every piece of baggage we've ever carried. Our homes protect us from the outside world, show off our taste, and accommodate our stuff. Perhaps above all, they prove to ourselves and to the world that we've really and truly moved out of our childhood bedrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what do we do when a house makes life impossible? What if it threatens to destroy us? What do we do when the market tanks, the hillside collapses, the sub-prime mortgage comes home to roost, or we're just too tired to keep working the extra jobs and overtime now required to afford what used to be a staple of middle-class life? Do we stick it out? Do we cash out? Do we return to the life of a renter, with its aura of tapestry-covered, grad-student-style impermanence? Does selling your house mean losing your independence or gaining it? Does giving it up mean giving up on yourself?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mercifully, I'm not losing my house to the bank. I have an old-fashioned thirty-year mortgage, and I make my payment every month. And despite the stucco incident, the property has hardly fallen into disrepair. It's true that at times home ownership has felt like a bigger burden than I imagined even in my most nail-biting pre-purchase moments. It's true that the money I've spent on plumbers and electricians and roofers and tree trimmers might ultimately have been put to better use on Hawaiian vacations while I remained an innocent renter. But the truth is that it wouldn't have really mattered. The cash would have slipped through my fingers anyway. Over the years, I've put preposterous amounts of energy and money into the places I've lived, even rentals. I've also put preposterous amounts into moving, storage, lost security deposits, and gas money for drives halfway across the country and back as I tried to figure out exactly where and how I wanted to live and whether my fitful bursts of house lust would ever translate into something approximating "settling down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this book is not just the story of the house I bought. It's also not just the story of other houses I tried to buy or of the disorienting yet sometimes hilarious effects of having a mother who seemed to rearrange the furniture more often than she changed her clothes. And while I could easily embark on a blow-by-blow of repairs and improvements and zombielike trips to <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, while I could rehash every detail of faulty wiring or of ornery workmen or rats that feasted on the orange tree in the backyard, I'm going to try to keep a lid on that particular pot. That's the standard stuff of home-buying stories, and having now devoured more home repair manuals and sybaritic shelter magazines than the sum total of my college reading, I've come to think it's about as interesting as people recounting their dreams over the breakfast table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, this is the story of what happens when, for whatever reason, your identity becomes almost totally wrapped up not in who you are or how you live but in where you live. It's than committing to a partner or doing my job or even the ostensibly obvious fact that the sun would rise and set regardless of whether my name was on a mortgage. And though I can't presume to be able to shed new light on what, in precredit-crunch days, possessed vast numbers of Americans to ignore all logic and purchase houses they couldn't begin to afford, I do think we were all touched by the same strain of crazy. I may make my payments, but I suspect there isn't a terribly wide gulf between people whose houses have been repossessed and people who, like me, simply seem possessed by whatever version of grown-up life we were hoping to play out by playing house. This is the story of my lifelong game of house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ONE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first house I ever had fantasies about was a wood-and-glass octagon occupied by an imaginary person whose name I'd decided was Malcolm Apricot Dingo. The way I remember it, the house (which was real) looked more like a giant lemonade pitcher than a place where people might actually live. It sat on a weedy plot of land on a winding street, a tall, barrel-like structure that at certain times of day and given a certain arrangement of the window shades provided a view all the way through to the backyard. I was six years old, and this was a source of unending delight; the house made me feel as if I had X-ray vision, as if I were bionic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twice a day, my mother drove me past this house on our twenty-minute drive to and from my school. The commute had been made necessary by our recent move to a new neighborhood and my mother's last-minute decision, amid my begging and tears, to allow me to attend first grade at the same school where I'd attended kindergarten. The summer before, my parents had bought their first house, a yellow brick bungalow in a state of nearly unfathomable decay, and for all of my mother's enthusiasm about the new neighborhood she hadn't taken the final step of forcing me to attend school in the proper district. In retrospect, this deferment of the inevitable seems by turns tender and useless. I'd transfer to my zone-appropriate school the following year. The year after that, we'd pack our belongings in a rented Ryder truck and move seventeen hundred miles to yet another town and another school, where I'd stay for three years before another local move necessitated another clumsy navigation through a brine of strangers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the year of the octagonal house, in those ten months when I passed it twice daily, each time announcing to my mother (I have an explicit memory of this, though she only vaguely recalls it) that Malcolm Apricot Dingo was watching us from behind the glass of what I was sure was his second-floor study, that having glanced up momentarily from his very important work he was waving to us, and that it was only polite that we wave back, I knew nothing of the gut-rattling chaos of being the new kid in school. I knew nothing of eating lunch alone while gamely pretending to read a book, of the indelibly bad impression that can be made from wearing the wrong clothes on the first day of school, of trying to forge friendships with people who've had the same best friend since before even the last time you were the new kid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I also had little territorial frame of reference other than the lush, heat-stroked hill country of Austin, Texas, where we'd moved when I was three and where we'd stay until I was nearly nine. Though I was born in Palo Alto, California, and had trace memories of suburban Chicago, where my family had done a six-month stint when I was a toddler, the bulk of my early childhood was pure Texan. I had a drawl; I said "y'all" and "ahs cream" and assumed that everyone else in the world did, too. I also assumed that every summer day everywhere topped out at 108 degrees and that all cockroaches were the size of turtles and that armadillos were a common form of roadkill. My brother, who was four years younger than I, had been born in Austin in 1974, making him a native Texan. The retired couple who lived next door and whose college-aged children I worshipped were like surrogate grandparents. The city was also home to my friends, my babysitters, my school, my cat—in other words, everything that mattered. I was blond and perpetually tanned and pocked with bites from Texas mosquitoes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I also happened to have an almost alarming fixation on Little House on the Prairie (first the TV show and, as soon as I could read, the books). I wore a sunbonnet passed down from my maternal great-grandmother, kept my hair in braids like Laura Ingalls, and occasionally called my parents Ma and Pa. When the bonnet wore down to a rag, my mother got out her sewing machine, which she often used to make our clothes, and whipped up a new one. At my request, she also helped me put my mattress on top of two box springs and leaned a stepladder against it, thereby mimicking the loft-bed setup of the Ingalls girls. In the yellow brick bungalow, where my mother built an elevated wooden play structure among the pecan trees in the backyard, I wore my bonnet along with an odd, scratchy calico skirt (a garment that could only have existed in the mid-1970s) and reenacted all manner of scenes from the books and TV episodes: the barn burning down, the dog getting lost, the whole family nearly dying from scarlet fever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One day, my mother came to me and said that we would be moving away to New Jersey. I remember sobbing in her arms but also taking comfort in her promise that there would be snow in the new place. Since there was snow in the Little House on the Prairie books, I figured we were moving closer to the frontier. When she told me there'd be a real wood-burning fireplace in the new house, I imagined us using it for cooking corn bread.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ridgewood, New Jersey, was no frontier, just a leafy village of perfectly clipped lawns abutting perfectly maintained houses. Mothers there did not sew clothes, much less build backyard play structures. In fact, they appeared not to do much of anything except play tennis, a discovery that seemed to turn my mother, who'd spent her Austin days attending Equal Rights Amendment rallies in peasant skirts, into an unhappy person almost overnight. Ironically, it was she who'd spearheaded the plan to move to Ridgewood. When my father, who'd been teaching music at the University of Texas, decided he wanted to live the life not of an academic but, rather, of a freelance composer (for commercial jingles, then hopefully for film and television) in New York, my mother had repeated the thing she'd apparently said shortly before they wed: "This marriage is about your career." She then sought relocation advice from our neighbors/surrogate grandparents, who, as it happened, had lived much of their lives in Ridgewood, New ?Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a little pricier," they'd said. "But it's the best."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I like it here," I said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Of course you do," my mother told me. "But if we stayed here, we wouldn't get to live in a new house!"</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes soared in April as buyers rushed to take advantage of an expiring tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said Wednesday that sales of new single-family homes rose 14.8% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 504,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for new homes had also surged in March, when sales climbed 29.9% from the prior month. Sales in April were 47.8% higher than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent surge was likely the result of expiring government incentives, which provided an $8,000 tax credit for first-time buyers and a $6,500 credit for repeat homeowners. Contracts for those homes had to be signed by April 30. Buyers have to complete purchases by June 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is stabilizing after both sales and prices plummeted during the recession. Sales of existing homes, a far bigger number than newly built homes, jumped 7.6% in April, the National Association of Realtors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of new homes also is picking up. Starts for single-family homes rose 10.2% in April from a month earlier, the fourth-straight monthly increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indices of home prices are no longer dropping precipitously; the closely watched Case-Schiller index has fallen for the past six months, but is above year-ago levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists say the April tax-credit deadline pulled forward some sales that, with the absence of the tax incentive, might have taken place later this summer. That could cause home sales to sag in the next couple of months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sales are on a mildly upward trend if you kind of look through those numbers," said Peter Newland, a <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> analyst, "but certainly that won't be apparent in the next few months, as you see the payback from the tax credit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in sales brought the backlog of new homes down to five months, based on the current rate of sales, from 6.2 months in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a new home fell to $198,400 last month from $219,600 in March, which was likely influenced by the tax credit also.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those who wanted to tap the tax credit tended to buy cheaper houses," said Aichi Amemiya, a <span class="companylink">Nomura Securities International Inc</span>. economist.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the winds of the housing recovery continue to blow at a moderate pace across the country, in the New York metropolitan area, it's a nor'easter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this week, the National Association of Realtors reported sales of existing, or previously owned, homes jumped 7.6% in April from the same month a year earlier. A large share of the jump was attributed to a handful of especially strong markets in the Northwest and the Northeast, including New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes in New York City and its surrounding suburbs posted a 39.6% gain, the fourth-largest rise in sales activities in the country, after Portland, Ore., (49.2%), Pittsburgh (42.2%) and Boston (41.8%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gains may be somewhat exaggerated because they are coming after a year of anemic activity. In 2009, "there was just a screeching halt in transactions. Any increase over nothing is going to be huge," said Sofia Song, vice president for research at the real-estate website StreetEasy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, economists said there's no mistake about a pickup in activity, the result of a strengthening economy and growing consumer confidence. Potential buyers who had been watching for signs of a turnaround are beginning to re-enter the market, according to Ms. Song.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think there's a lot of latent demand in the New York market," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Diffley, an economist with IHS Global Insight, attributed the rise in sales activity to a stronger job market in New York and the broader northeast region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The underlying fundamentals are so much worse in a place like Florida or San Diego," he said. "The job market is doing a lot better than it was, and in a lot of respects it's running ahead of the rest of the country."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices, meanwhile, remain subdued. The Realtors report said median prices for the New York metropolitan area rose 2.8% in April compared with a year earlier. But a report released Tuesday by <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> found that area home prices declined in April; the company's Case-Shiller home price index fell 1.27 points, to 169.42 from 170.69 a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discrepancy in prices partly reflects methodology. NAR calculates a median price based on sales of all homes, which can be skewed by the mix of homes sold in a given month. The Case-Shiller index captures changes in sales prices on the same properties compared with the last time they were sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Blitzer, a managing director of Case-Shiller's Index Committee, said both reports are showing that prices are essentially stable. "I think if you look at broad trends, though, the boom and the bust, I think you'll see similar things," Mr. Blitzer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long Island and northern New Jersey posted strong numbers. Nassau County had 616 sales in April, up 25.7% from the same month last year, while Suffolk County was up 39% to 656 closings, according to figures from the state Realtors association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westchester County saw a 58.7% increase in sales volume, to 280 closings last month from 179 in April 2009 to 280.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northern New Jersey's Bergen County, a bedroom community for many New Yorkers, saw a 39% increase in sales, to 361 from 259 in April 2009. The median price rose slightly, to $425,000 from $417,000, according to the New Jersey Multiple Listing Service Inc. Sales in Bergen, Essex, Hudson and Passaic counties, comprising the broader northern New Jersey region, rose 26.7% year-to-year, while the median sale price rose $20,000, or 5.9%, in the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judy Appleby, president of the New Jersey Association of Realtors, said members of her group are seeing much higher confidence levels among buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Last year, with the problems in the auto industry and the banks it was all just doom and gloom," she said. Several weeks ago, she added, she saw a 4.65% interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage, being advertised by Wells Fargo Bank. "I said to my husband, maybe we should buy something!" she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Ogilvy, a luxury broker in Greenwich, Conn., said his market is seeing renewed activity, and houses there are spending less time on the market. So far this year, 182 homes have sold in Greenwich, with an average price of $2.2 million, according to Christie's Great Estates of Greenwich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On May 14, after just one month on the market, Round Hill, a $33 million estate that once belonged to the Hirschhorn family, was put under contract by an undisclosed buyer, according to Mr. Ogilvy. The sale is expected to close in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's interesting watching how 2010 is really quite like 2008, and much better than 2009. It's just many more showings. Showings don't mean you're selling, but it does mean you're getting up to bat," Mr. Ogilvy said. "When something sells very quickly, that usually means a very good price."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite rumblings of activity in the high-end market, however, the NAR said that first-time buyers were still a significant driver. Nationally, 49% of home sales in April were to first-time buyers. An $8,000 tax credit for these buyers expired at the end of last month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial real estate is developing a split personality as investors pay up for properties that have good tenants and punish those that don't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Seattle-area office building that is occupied by <span class="companylink">Microsoft Corp</span>. and under agreement to be sold for $310 million is one of the latest signs of that deepening fissure. If the sale of City Center Plaza in Bellevue, Wash., closes as expected in coming weeks, it would be one of the West Coast's biggest office deals this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also would be one of the richest. Cole Credit Property Trust III Inc., a nontraded real-estate investment trust managed by Cole Real Estate Investments of Phoenix, has agreed to pay Beacon Capital Partners of Boston about $531 a square foot for the 583,000-square-foot building in tony Bellevue that was completed in 2008. That is below the $582-a-square-foot peak price paid in a top-of-the-market transaction in 2006, the highest Bellevue price fetched in recent years, according to <span class="companylink">CoStar Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is well above the $133-a-square-foot price paid last year for the then-largely empty former <span class="companylink">WaMu</span> Center building in Seattle, which will be renamed the <span class="companylink">Russell Investments</span> Center. Analysts said City Center Plaza's lofty price tag partly reflects investors' appetite for buildings with long-term leases to high-credit tenants who ideally will carry properties through a downturn by providing a predictable rent stream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a concern about fundamentals eroding," said Peter Slatin, editorial director of <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a New York real-estate research firm. "Right now everybody is pretty much going for low-risk real estate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In boom years, just the opposite is true. Investors like properties with expiring leases because they invariably can charge higher rents than those the outgoing tenants are paying. Long-term leases limit their upsides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these days, when empty space often goes unfilled, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>'s net lease for 96.3% of the City Center through 2024 insulates the building's rent stream from the trouble's roiling today's market. The office vacancy rate in the Seattle area rose to 13.5% in the first quarter from about 8.1% at the end of 2007, according to CoStar. The first-quarter U.S. vacancy rate was 12.8%, and rents are declining, CoStar said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the net leases are seen by some investors as a way to get a bond-like return that typically tracks the tenant's creditworthiness. For example, the initial return on the City Center Plaza deal is expected to be in the 6.5% range, according to people familiar with the matter. That return is above both the 3.4% annual yield on 10-year <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> bonds and the 4.9% yield on 30-year <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> bonds, said Jamie Rizzo of Fitch Ratings. Investors get a higher return on the building upfront because they assume risk later on regarding how much the building will be worth when the lease ends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, real-estate investors have been divided between the value-oriented camp that seeks steady returns and those who buy properties on the cheap with the hopes of fixing them up and flipping them. But few banks or distressed owners are willing to sell at today's lower prices, and that has left buyers chasing the high-end, well-leased properties that are on the block, Mr. Slatin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The City Center Plaza acquisition marks the largest investment by dollar value in Cole Real Estate Investments' roughly three decades in business. Negotiations got under way this year after the property fell out of contract with a German buyer who had offered to pay slightly less, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher Cole, 56 years old, moved from the Seattle area to Arizona to attend Arizona State University on a track scholarship. Over the years, he has built a company, and through all its affiliates Cole has an acquisition value of more than $5 billion. About 80% of the properties are retail buildings, much of it with long-term net leases to such companies as Walgreens and <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as an investment, Cole executives said the building isn't much of a departure from the many drug and electronic stores that it leases across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It boils down to the quality of the asset and the quality of the tenant and the fact that it's a very long-term lease," said Kim Kundrak, Cole's chief acquisitions officer.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan </div><div>903 words</div><div>26 May 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A23</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the winds of the housing recovery continue to blow at a moderate pace across the country, in the New York metropolitan area, it's a nor'easter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this week, the National Association of Realtors reported sales of existing, or previously owned, homes jumped 7.6% in April from the same month a year earlier. A large share of the jump was attributed to a handful of especially strong markets in the Northwest and the Northeast, including New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes in New York City and its surrounding suburbs posted a 39.6% gain, the fourth-largest rise in sales activities in the country, after Portland, Ore., (49.2%), Pittsburgh (42.2%) and Boston (41.8%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gains may be somewhat exaggerated because they are coming after a year of anemic activity. In 2009, "there was just a screeching halt in transactions. Any increase over nothing is going to be huge," said Sofia Song, vice president for research at the real-estate website StreetEasy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, economists said there's no mistake about a pickup in activity, the result of a strengthening economy and growing consumer confidence. Potential buyers who had been watching for signs of a turnaround are beginning to re-enter the market, according to Ms. Song.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think there's a lot of latent demand in the New York market," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Diffley, an economist with IHS Global Insight, attributed the rise in sales activity to a stronger job market in New York and the broader northeast region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The underlying fundamentals are so much worse in a place like Florida or San Diego," he said. "The job market is doing a lot better than it was, and in a lot of respects it's running ahead of the rest of the country."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices, meanwhile, remain subdued. The Realtors report said median prices for the New York metropolitan area rose 2.8% in April compared with a year earlier. But a report released Tuesday by <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> found that area home prices declined in April; the company's Case-Shiller home price index fell 1.27 points, to 169.42 from 170.69 a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discrepancy in prices partly reflects methodology. NAR calculates a median price based on sales of all homes, which can be skewed by the mix of homes sold in a given month. The Case-Shiller index captures changes in sales prices on the same properties compared with the last time they were sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Blitzer, a managing director of Case-Shiller's Index Committee, said both reports are showing that prices are essentially stable. "I think if you look at broad trends, though, the boom and the bust, I think you'll see similar things," Mr. Blitzer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long Island and northern New Jersey posted strong numbers. Nassau County had 616 sales in April, up 25.7% from the same month last year, while Suffolk County was up 39% to 656 closings, according to figures from the state Realtors association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westchester County saw a 58.7% increase in sales volume, to 280 closings last month from 179 in April 2009 to 280.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northern New Jersey's Bergen County, a bedroom community for many New Yorkers, saw a 39% increase in sales, to 361 from 259 in April 2009. The median price rose slightly, to $425,000 from $417,000, according to the New Jersey Multiple Listing Service Inc. Sales in Bergen, Essex, Hudson and Passaic counties, comprising the broader northern New Jersey region, rose 26.7% year-to-year, while the median sale price rose $20,000, or 5.9%, in the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judy Appleby, president of the New Jersey Association of Realtors, said members of her group are seeing much higher confidence levels among buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Last year, with the problems in the auto industry and the banks it was all just doom and gloom," she said. Several weeks ago, she added, she saw a 4.65% interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage, being advertised by Wells Fargo Bank. "I said to my husband, maybe we should buy something!" she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Ogilvy, a luxury broker in Greenwich, Conn., said his market is seeing renewed activity, and houses there are spending less time on the market. So far this year, 182 homes have sold in Greenwich, with an average price of $2.2 million, according to Christie's Great Estates of Greenwich.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">White House Seeks Votes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Federal Spending Cuts</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The White House proposed a new tool Monday for trimming federal spending that would force Congress to vote yes or no on a package of cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan would let the president comb through spending bills he has already signed into law, pick out items he deems wasteful, bundle them into a package and send bills to Congress where lawmakers could vote "up or down" on the entire package -- with no amendments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As voters are increasingly anxious about the widening federal deficit, the proposal is aimed at demonstrating the White House is serious about controlling spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In it, President Barack Obama is making some common cause with Republicans, and even with the tea-party activists, who are focused on reducing the deficit and scaling back government. Enacting the new system is expected to meet resistance in Congress.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State and local governments are continuing to cut jobs and spending as they struggle to close budget gaps, according to a report by the National League of Cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, released Monday, included a survey that showed three out of four cities said they faced worsening budget woes over the past year, with seven in 10 cutting jobs and capital projects in response. The report underscores how a retrenchment in the government sector, combined with higher taxes, is weighing on the economic recovery just as the private sector has begun adding jobs and showing other signs of a turnaround.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About half of the survey's respondents suggested that city services would need to be cut over the next two years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expiration of the credit has raised concerns among economists and others that the housing market could falter without it. Last week, the Commerce Department reported that, while home construction rose in April, permits for future building fell sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, sales of existing homes may fare better than new-home sales, because used homes are generally cheaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Although inventory levels remain above normal and much of the gain last month was seasonal, the housing price correction appears to be essentially over," NAR economist Lawrence Yun said. He projected a "temporary fallback" for existing-homes sales in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of used homes for sale at the end of April increased 11.5% to 4.04 million. That represented an 8.4-month supply at the current sales pace, compared with an 8.1-month supply in March. Regionally, April sales increased 21.1% in the Northeast, 9.9% in the Midwest and 8.6% in the South. Sales declined 6.2% in the West.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for Manhattan office space is emerging from a two-year slumber. But it's up to the city's jobs engine to make sure that it doesn't doze off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midtown real-estate types are getting some of their swagger back. On Park Avenue, the landlord of the historic Seagram Building has already raised asking rents three times this year, according to brokerage <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Eighth Avenue, the broker marketing the new office tower called 11 Times Square says he's looking for rents of $120 per square foot on the upper floors despite the building's location on the western edge of the midtown corporate corridor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Optimists are saying that boutique banks and financial giants, law firms, ad agencies and even media companies are showing a greater interest in signing new leases for office space than any time since mid-2008. Leases are expiring, and companies that sense things are looking up want to lock in deals before it's too late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's far from clear, however, how long the burst of optimism will last. Despite the pickup in activity, many businesses aren't expanding when they lease space partly because they have figured out how to use less space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also it's unclear whether job growth -- the driving force behind commercial real-estate demand -- is coming back in force anytime soon. Until then, the skeptics say, new leases being signed by office tenants amount to a zero-sum game, filling up some buildings but emptying out others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Without any sustained job growth there will be no recovery," said Billy Cohen of commercial real-estate services firm Newmark <span class="companylink">Knight Frank</span>. "There will be only music chairs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cohen would know. His task is to find tenants for some one million square feet of vacant and soon-to-be vacant space in the Empire State Building. Even though Mr. Cohen's goal is to reposition the building as a home for large tenants like finance and media companies, the market is still so shaky that he's willing to spend money on relocating dentists and other small tenants to other parts of the building rather than showing them the door when their lease runs out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the amount of available office space in New York doesn't appear to be diminishing significantly. Research firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>. says the first three months of this year represented the ninth straight quarter in which the amount of available office space in the city grew, bringing the total growth in available space since January, 2008, to 20.6 million square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March and April, however, the market seems to have stabilized a bit, with the amount of available space decreasing by 770,000 square feet, says brokerage <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason the market seems to be bouncing along the bottom is deals like the one that <span class="companylink">Tiffany &amp;Co</span>. signed at 200 Fifth Ave., a newly renovated office building across from Madison Square Park. The jeweler will take 260,000 square feet in the building -- but will vacate more than 270,000 square feet of space in three locations in midtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Levinson, the co-owner of 200 Fifth, acknowledges that the tougher leasing market means he likely won't be able to turn the kind of profit he projected when he and <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc</span>. paid $480 million for the building in 2007. Mr. Levinson is also a real-estate adviser to <span class="companylink">News Corp</span>., which owns The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tiffany, on the other hand, says it will save $125 million over the course of its 15-year lease at Mr. Levinson's building compared with its current locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City employment has ticked up slightly this year, rising by about 70,000 jobs since January 2010 to a total of 3.6 million. That's still more than 100,000 below the July 2008, employment peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it is, many companies already have enough space to start hiring again without expanding their footprint. Mark Aaron, Tiffany vice president for investor relations, for example, said the new space at 200 Fifth Ave. will allow Tiffany's headquarters staff to grow -- even though the total square footage is smaller than what the company now occupies in its offices in midtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of that's because companies that are signing new leases are finding ways to put more employees in less space by using the latest in furniture and office layout trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller, well-to-do office tenants such as hedge funds appear to be leading the market upward. Brokerage <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> refers to the Seagram Building at 375 Park Ave. as a market bellwether for high-priced buildings because it caters to those kinds of tenants and tends to sign multiple leases with tenants every quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building's landlords has boosted asking rents three times on new leases this year, the brokerage says. An executive for RFR Realty LLC, the building's owner, didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in one of the year's biggest leasing deals, <span class="companylink">Proskauer Rose LLP</span> last week announced it would become the first tenant for 11 Times Square, an office tower erected during the depths of the recession and set to be complete in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law firm is moving out of space in the <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> building at 1585 Broadway and in a positive sign for the market, the bank itself is expected to occupy the floors that Proskauer is emptying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are so many tenants in the market now or making deals it's mindboggling," said Stephen Siegel of <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, the broker for the developer in the Proskauer deal. "The bottom-fishers have just about gotten all the fish off the bottom."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European markets edged higher Monday in a choppy session, as banking stocks lost ground amid worries about the impact of the Bank of Spain's bailout of CajaSur while the euro continued to stumble against the dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Recent events should be a wake-up call to all those commentators who simply wished to extrapolate from last year's progress," said Robert Talbut, chief investment officer at <span class="companylink">Royal London Asset Management</span>. "My view remains that the global economy and financial markets are more risky than 'standard' analysis would predict."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spanish banks led the declines among European financial stocks, after Spain's central bank moved to take over church-controlled savings bank CajaSur. Spanish bank <span class="companylink">Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria</span> fell 2% and Banco Santander lost 1.2%, though they both closed off their lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, overall declines in Europe were slight, while several markets were closed, observing the traditional Whit Monday or Pentecost holiday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the close of European equity markets, the Stoxx 600 index gained 0.4% at 238.02. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index rose 0.1% at 5069.61, Germany's DAX index finished down 0.4% at 5805.68, and France's CAC-40 index closed little changed at 3430.93.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil and gas stocks also weighed on equity markets after BP admitted that the amount of oil it was siphoning from the massive Gulf of Mexico leak had declined for a third consecutive day. BP ended down 2.7% and was the biggest decliner on London's FTSE 100 index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Asia, stock markets ended mostly higher Monday, with Chinese property developers in Hong Kong and the mainland surging on anticipation that Beijing might move slowly on any fresh measures to curb domestic property prices. Meanwhile, U.S. stocks were lower overall at the close of European equity markets with the Dow Jones Industrials Average down 0.3% at 10159.53, taking a breather from its rally in the previous session.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic calendar was quiet on Monday which contributed to the rather lackluster trading. U.S. existing home sales rose in April but many commentators said this was likely due to home buyer tax credits. On Tuesday, the macro agenda will pick up, with U.S. S&amp;P/Case Shiller house price index, consumer confidence for May and FHFA house price index all expected, and likely to shed further light on the strength of the U.S. economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late in Europe, the euro traded at $1.2406, off more than 1% and down 13% for the year. Over the weekend, European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichet insisted that the euro is a credible currency but said tighter regulation is needed of banks, markets and government policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sterling fared better against the dollar, easing 0.1% to $1.4445. U.K. chancellor George Osborne announced details of £6.25 billion of spending cuts to help reduce the country's huge deficit. Elsewhere, three-month U.S. dollar libor traded above 0.5% for the first time since June 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among other assets, spot gold for June delivery on the Comex division of the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span> was at $1192.10 per troy ounce, up 1.4% or $16.00 at the close of European equity markets. July Nymex crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile exchange were up $0.14 or 0.2% at $70.18 per barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In major market action: Miners, which are leveraged to economic growth, advanced, with <span class="companylink">Rio Tinto</span> up 1.7% and <span class="companylink">Anglo American</span> up 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">British Airways</span> rose 0.9%. The airline is facing a five-day walkout of cabin crew and has about 70% of its flights running.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tobacco firm <span class="companylink">Imperial Tobacco</span> rose 2.1%. The company was upgraded to "buy" from "neutral" at Nomura, which said concerns such as low-to-medium underlying profit growth, U.S. competition, U.K. margins, plain packaging and leaf cost inflation are valid, but more than priced into shares.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for Manhattan office space is emerging from a two-year slumber. But it's up to the city's jobs engine to make sure that it doesn't doze off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midtown real-estate types are getting some of their swagger back. On Park Avenue, the landlord of the historic Seagram Building has already raised asking rents three times this year, according to brokerage <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Eighth Avenue, the broker marketing the new office tower called 11 Times Square says he's looking for rents of $120 per square foot on the upper floors despite the building's location on the western edge of the midtown corporate corridor.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The foreclosure problem hit New York City homeowners later than most other cities, but the problems are growing. In the first quarter of this year, there were 4,226 foreclosures across the city, up 16.3% from 3,635 foreclosures in the same period a year ago, according to data compiled by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Queens and Brooklyn were responsible for more than 70% of all foreclosures in the city during the quarter, with 1,556 in Queens and 1,546 in Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan was last on the quarterly foreclosure list with 164 compared with 98 a year ago, according to the Furman Center.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. My husband and I own a co-op and have about $320,000 worth of equity. We're looking to buy a house in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens in Brooklyn for $595,000. It's not a foreclosure, but it doesn't have a functioning kitchen or bathroom. (Nearby, a similar, smaller house in good condition is for sale for $879,000.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We think we can get the place for $475,000. Rehabbing it could cost as much as $400,000. But our real estate agent says that we'll have to pay all cash because no one will lend on a house in this condition. Is that true? We only have about $80,000 in cash, but our income and credit are excellent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Your real estate agent is mistaken; you do have financing options. Your best bet is an FHA 203k rehabilitation mortgage. It allows you to roll the purchase price, rehabilitation and closing costs, and even up to six months of mortgage payments (if you don't plan to live in the house during renovation) into one fixed- or adjustable-rate loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, you won't be able to borrow the entire $875,000 that you estimate it would take to buy and renovate this home. In Brooklyn, according to New York mortgage broker Melanie Crawford, FHA203k mortgages cover up to 96.5% financing of the purchase price and rehabilitation cost, to a base loan amount of $729,750. You can go higher than that if you install energy-efficient improvements, but cannot borrow more than 110% of either the value of the property plus the cost of rehab, or the appraised value of the property after rehab, whichever is less. You'd have to make up any shortfall. (For more rules on this program, see the Housing and Urban Development website[http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/203k/203kabou.cfm].)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this loan doesn't work, you can also try alternative, private financing sources, including hard-money lenders (who accept riskier loans in return for above-market interest rates), parents and friends. Or you could approach the current owners for a private mortgage with an above-market interest rate. Just because the house is in bad shape, you shouldn't assume the owners are financially strapped. They could be investors, heirs or out-of-towners who just don't want to bother with fixing up the home before selling it. If that's the case, they may prefer steady income from financially stable people over the lump sum they'd get from a regular sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I applaud your interest in rehabbing a distressed property, since doing so can help prop up neighborhood property values, and rescue an eyesore that might attract criminals and vandals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I should warn you that, since the cost to buy and rehab this home approximates what you'd pay for one nearby in good condition, you won't be getting much of a deal. Nor should you expect to get an appreciation windfall should you decide to sell in the near future. Home sales in Brooklyn have picked up considerably this year from the anemic levels we saw after the market crash in September 2008, but prices are still down from last year and may take a while to recover. Don't count on being able to flip this house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the circumstances, you should at least consider buying the move-in ready home down the street, and skip all the drywall dust and screaming circular saws.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly a year after the recession likely ended, and despite huge government support, the housing market looks as sick as ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest bad news: At the end of March, borrowers on 10.06% of residential mortgages had missed at least one payment, up from 9.47% at the end of 2009, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The association cautioned that seasonal adjustments may have distorted the latest number. The unadjusted numbers show the delinquency rate remaining more or less flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The elevated percentages are, of course, driven by high unemployment. Healthy job creation should help them fall a bit. But the longer they remain high, the more investors should worry that housing re-enters a vicious circle, where a heavy flow of foreclosures forces prices lower, leading to more defaults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, efforts to shore up house prices look strained. Since the end of 2007, outstanding household mortgage debt has remained at about $10 trillion, sustained in part by huge government mortgage purchases, loan-modification programs and superlow interest rates. Yet those haven't stopped house prices sliding 20%. And the support may taper. By next year, there could be a less-Democratic Congress, which may not favor so much government mortgage buying or homeowner bailouts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, the housing market may yet be allowed to clear. Painful, but inevitable.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>562 words</div><div>19 May 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices will begin a gradual recovery by next year, according a survey of 92 economists and other housing analysts by MacroMarkets LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that single-family housing starts in April surged to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 593,000, up 10.2% from March. Ivy Zelman, chief executive of research firm Zelman &amp;Associates, said builders stepped up production ahead of the April 30 deadline for sales qualifying for a federal tax credit, but since then have cut back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysts surveyed by MacroMarkets on average expect home prices, as measured by the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller national index, to rise about 12% in the five years ending Dec. 31, 2014. As of Dec. 31, that index was down about 28% from its peak level in mid-2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the forecasters surveyed by MacroMarkets were far from the average. Joseph LaVorgna, an economist at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>, sees home prices rising 37% by the end of 2014. Both Anthony Sanders, a professor of real-estate finance at George Mason University, and Gary Shilling, president of A. Gary Shilling &amp;Co., expect declines of about 18%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shilling, whose firm provides economic consulting and investment advice, said excess inventories, including those from looming foreclosures, will pull prices down. Mr. LaVorgna said a rapidly recovering job market should soak up most of that supply. He added that much of the excess supply is in remote or economically depressed regions and so isn't relevant to most potential buyers, who will instead bid up prices in more desirable areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MacroMarkets, based in Madison, N.J., was co-founded by Robert Shiller, an economist at Yale University who helped create the Case-Shiller indexes. MacroMarkets creates securities that let people bet on the direction of various types of assets, including residential real estate. The survey by MacroMarkets was the first of what it says will be a monthly series involving about 100 analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shiller, who didn't contribute a forecast for the survey, said in an interview that the average prediction of a 12% price rise over five years was "a plausible scenario." During the housing boom, Mr. Shiller drew attention for bearish house-price comments that were far gloomier than the consensus but eventually proved to be on the mark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Census Bureau also reported that single-family building permits in April fell 10.7% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 484,000. Ms. Zelman said builders have slowed down now that it is too late for buyers to get the federal tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before ramping up construction again, she said, builders will await signs that demand "isn't falling off a cliff" after being temporarily buoyed by the tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Zelman forecast that single-family housing starts for all of this year will total 559,000. That would be up 26% from 445,000 in 2009, but still off 67% from the peak level of 1.72 million in 2005. Ms. Zelman expects demand to be constrained by high unemployment, tight credit and the large number of Americans unable to sell their current homes because they owe far more than the market value.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A long-running family feud over a portfolio of Manhattan property moved closer to resolution Tuesday when a New York court ruled that Neil Bender is fit to run William Gottlieb's billion-dollar estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The appellate court ruling cleared a major legal obstacle that some brokers say may have kept Mr. Bender and his father, Irving Bender, from developing blocks of prime real estate in the West Village and the Meatpacking District that brokers have valued at up to $1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The case, brought by Neil Bender's sister and her son, pushed a private, often bitter family squabble into the public spotlight. In the suit, his sister, Cheryl Dier, alleged that Mr. Bender was unfit to run the estate's property portfolio. Her son submitted as evidence drunken-driving convictions and Internal Revenue Service tax liens against Mr. Bender. In court filings, Mr. Bender said Ms. Dier was "spiteful" for being left out of the family inheritance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today's unanimous decision by the Appellate Court is an important victory for the estate of William Gottlieb," a spokeswoman for the Benders, Lin-Hua Wu, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dier, who represented herself in court, could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She could still contest the will that made Mr. Bender the estate's administrator, but attorneys say that, broadly speaking, the success rate for such challenges is very low. "This is a big victory Neil Bender," says Kevin Smith, a partner at <span class="companylink">Stroock &amp;Stroock &amp;Lavan</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bender runs the estate of his uncle William Gottlieb, a lifetime bachelor who started buying swaths of property in the 1950s. The portfolio holds more than 100 buildings, primarily in the West Village and Meatpacking District, including the 19th-century Keller Hotel, property near the High Line and premier addresses on Bleecker Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gottlieb died in 1999 and left his estate to his sister, Mollie Bender. When Ms. Bender broke her hip, she petitioned to resign as executor to the will and requested that her son Neil be the estate's administrator. Before that wish was carried out, Ms. Bender died, in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her will left the Gottlieb estate to her son and her husband and excluded her daughter, Ms. Dier. Three days after Ms. Bender's death, Ms. Dier filed objections to her mother's will and to the appointment of Neil and Irving Bender as preliminary executors of the estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She alleged that Neil was unfit to serve as the estate's administrator and that he was a "habitual drunkard," according to court records. The court said of Mr. Bender that there was no evidence "indicating that any purported substance abuse is so habitual as presently to affect his ability to handle estate affairs sufficiently."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her son, Michael Corbett, who once worked for Mr. Gottlieb as a restaurant manager, tried to organize community opposition to Mr. Bender, according to merchants and residents in the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A surrogate court ruled that the allegations against Mr. Bender, "even if true, did not rise to a level that would warrant disqualification." The opinion was upheld Tuesday by the appellate court.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Mark Whitehouse </div><div>1317 words</div><div>17 May 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Asia</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>10</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets fell sharply Friday amid new jitters about Europe's debt troubles, underscoring worries that external woes may threaten the recovering but still vulnerable U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upbeat reports on U.S. shoppers and factories Friday added to the picture of an economy firmly in recovery mode. Rising consumer spending appears to be offsetting a moribund housing market, and businesses seem on track to keep investing -- and, possibly, hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the strong U.S. data failed to cheer financial markets, as concerns about Europe's ability to contain its sovereign-debt crisis took center stage. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 1.51% Friday, while the euro sank below $1.24. Borrowing rates for European banks rose sharply, reflecting persistent fears that harsh austerity measures could prove too much for the governments and economies of Greece, Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's important to recognize that we're now in a solid recovery -- but it's not a gangbusters recovery, and we have a new wild card in the picture, which is the European mess," said Frederic Mishkin, a professor at Columbia Business School who served on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors from 2006 to 2008. "Except for a very large shock, we should be OK, but we still don't know how big of a shock this could end up being."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Commerce Department said retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in April, building on a robust 2.1% rise in March and consistent with annualized, inflation-adjusted economic growth of more than 3% in the current quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production, adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, rose 0.8% in April as manufacturers raised output of raw materials and construction supplies, the Federal Reserve reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the world's largest economy might be out of intensive care, it's still weak. The rate of growth falls far short of the 7%-to-9% booms that helped restore jobs and rebuild strength after previous deep downturns. Even at April's relatively strong rate of job growth, it could take seven years to get the unemployment rate -- currently 9.9% -- back down to the 5% level of December 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're getting more growth than people expected, but it's less than we need to put us on a path that would undo the damage in any reasonable period of time," said Bruce Kasman, an economist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> in New York. His projection for growth this year, at 3.7%, is among the more optimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On average, economists polled earlier this month for The Wall Street Journal expect inflation-adjusted growth of 3.2% in 2010, up from a forecast of 2.6% in May 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that rate, economic output should be regaining its pre-recession level about now, describing a recovery path shallower than the "V" some had hoped for, but better than the "L" many had feared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe's troubles present several kinds of threats to the U.S. Among the most dangerous is the possibility that fears of bank losses related to sovereign-debt defaults would undermine confidence in the global financial system -- fears that <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span> Chief Executive Josef Ackermann fanned late Thursday by expressing doubts on German television about Greece's ability to repay its debts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one sign of returning jitters, the annual cost of insuring against default on a &lt;euro&gt;10 million basket of European bank debt rose Friday, to &lt;euro&gt;145,000 from &lt;euro&gt;129,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another worst-case scenario, the fiscal stress in Europe could engender fears about other countries with large budget deficits and growing government debt loads, such as the U.S. and the U.K. "If investors decide that countries with big budget deficits are a bad place to put their money, that's a problem, because half of the world economy has big budget deficits," said Ethan Harris, head of North America economics at <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span><span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the absence of a full crisis, Europe's feeble economy can still be a drag, cutting into the exports that have played a large role in boosting U.S. output.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Austerity measures will hit hardest in the southern European countries that have generated much of the region's consumer spending growth, adding to doubts that Europe can add meaningfully to global demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro-zone grew at an annual rate of just 0.8% in the first quarter, one-fourth the pace in the U.S. and only a small fraction of growth rates in China and India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The falling European currency can also hit U.S. exports, about one-fifth of which go to the European Union. As of Friday, one euro bought as little as $1.2376, down 4% in just one week and 13.5% on the year, making U.S. products more expensive for European consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve is now expected to raise interest rates more aggressively than the European Central Bank, one of various factors weighing on the euro. The ECB is seen staying on the sidelines through 2011 with its main policy rate at just 1%, some economists say. Earlier this year, some economists had penciled in rate hikes as early as the middle of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. exporters can still count on the booming economies of Asia. In one sign of Asia's growing importance, the moving 12-month sum of U.S. merchandise exports to Asia's emerging markets exceeded that of exports to the European Union for the first time. Growth in Asia shows little sign of cooling: In April, Chinese retail sales were up 18% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, domestic demand in the U.S. is holding up so far. Stimulated by federal tax breaks and the cash some have saved by not paying their mortgages, U.S. consumers spent a seasonally adjusted $366 billion in April. That's up 9% from the low point in December 2008, but still about 4% below the pre-recession peak. Most of the rise came in sales of building materials -- possibly related to home sales stimulated by tax credits that expired at the end of April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers from <span class="companylink">Intel Corp</span>. to <span class="companylink">Caterpillar Inc</span>. have seen a strong rebound as rising sales both at home and abroad prompt them and other companies to restock the inventories they slashed during the darkest days of the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most forward-looking measure of manufacturing activity, an index the Institute for Supply Management compiles from a monthly survey of purchasing managers, soared to 60.4 in April, 20% above the pre-recession high in January 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the recovery might not be as strong as it seems. Excluding temporary factors such as inventory restocking and government stimulus, the economy wouldn't have grown at all in the first quarter, according to estimates from <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the boost from inventories and stimulus fades toward the end of this year, consumers and companies will have to pick up the slack by buying more new houses and investing more of their cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 290,000 jobs created in April offer some reason for optimism, and central banks in the U.S. and Europe are being careful to support demand by keeping interest rates low, particularly amid growing jitters about Europe. But shrinking bank lending and a budget crunch at state and local governments present obstacles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are getting there, but have a long way to go," says Robert Hall, an economist at Stanford University who chairs the business-cycle dating committee at the National Bureau of Economic Research. ---</p>

</div><div class="author">By M.P. McQueen </div><div>845 words</div><div>11 May 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Asia</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>9</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are you overlooking a commercial real-estate boom?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If your definition of the category is limited to splashy office parks and shopping malls, both of which took a pounding during the financial crisis and haven't fully recovered, then you probably are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But think a little smaller -- like fast food-restaurants, convenience stores and gas stations -- and the returns get bigger. Such ventures, known as triple-net-lease properties, are "the best-performing sector of the commercial real estate marketplace," says David Bailin, head of global managed investments for Citi Private Bank, which serves ultra-high-net-worth clients. "It is the sector that lost the least value [during the recession] and rallied the quickest."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Triple-net-lease properties are usually freestanding buildings in which a tenant agrees to take responsibility for maintenance, taxes and insurance during a long lease -- leaving the investor with little to do but collect checks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors in the U.S. typically buy individual properties through commercial real-estate brokers like Marcus &amp;Millichap, <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group</span> or others, either alone or in limited partnerships with a few other investors, and then lease them out to occupants such as drugstore chains, quick-serve restaurants, convenience and dollar stores, medical outfits, and in some cases big-box retailers like <span class="companylink">Costco</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Triple-net-lease properties in the U.S. are generating annual returns of as much as 12% these days, estimates Bernard J. Haddigan, managing director of Marcus &amp;Millichap Real Estate Investment Services' National Retail Group. Individual investors and small groups of partners generally invest $300,000 to $5 million per building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some publicly traded U.S. real-estate investment trusts concentrate on triple-net-lease properties, too. They returned 16.9% during the first quarter -- compared with 11.1% for Dow Jones Equity All REIT Index, which includes all types of commercial and residential property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Triple-net properties suffered during the recession, but less than other types of real estate. Whereas overall commercial prices in the U.S. fell by about 40% during 2007-09, prices for triple-net properties fell by about 15%, according to Mr. Haddigan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like all kinds of investing, triple-net-lease plays are based on risk: the more you're willing to take, the greater the potential returns. There are several important factors that determine a triple net deal's riskiness: the creditworthiness of the tenant, the location, physical condition and functionality of the property, and the remaining term on a lease (shorter is riskier). Also important: the "occupancy cost" or "health ratio," defined as the percentage that the tenant pays in rent relative to store sales. (The lower the ratio, the better.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides overall economic risk, there's the risk of picking a tenant whose product or service might fall out of favor. Changing consumer trends can wipe out cash cows, as happened with some video-rental stores during the last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You need a good tenant," says Jeffrey Rogers, president and chief operating officer of Integra Realty Resources, a commercial real-estate appraisal and consulting firm that doesn't own or broker real estate. "Then you need an optimal location and to know what the market rent is. That is absolutely key."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with most income properties, investors can come out ahead -- or behind -- on triple-net properties in two ways: through price appreciation and income. The best measure of income potential is the so-called capitalization rate, or the net operating income divided by the purchase price of a property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, cap rates have been falling because property prices nationally are rebounding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More investors are going after fewer high-quality properties, driving prices up. This is considered a positive sign for the broader commercial real estate market -- but it means the easy money in triple-net-lease properties might be coming to an end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is still opportunity for savvy investors. Michael K. Federman, 38 years old, is an attorney in New York who began investing in triple-net properties in 2004, during the previous recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His first acquisitions were fried-chicken restaurants in upstate New York, followed by a Circle K convenience store in Arizona. He later sold the Circle K and purchased more buildings, and currently owns a portfolio of 15 properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A self-professed "conservative" investor, Mr. Federman now concentrates primarily on single-tenant properties, he says. Most recently, he and a business partner in March purchased a long-term lease property for about $4 million housing a <span class="companylink">Chipotle Mexican Grill</span> in Lower Manhattan with a cap rate of 8.5%. That return was in line with the national average for casual dining restaurants in 2009, according to Marcus &amp;Millichap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For me it was a perfect deal," he says, "because it combined prime real estate, stellar credit and minimal management responsibilities."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Office of the White House Counsel" in Mark Green and Michele Jolin, eds., Change for America: A Progressive Blueprint for the 44th President (Basic Books 2009).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Foreword" in Daniel Hamilton and Alfred Brophy, eds., Transformations in American Legal History: Essays in Honor of Professor Morton J. Horwitz (Harvard 2009).</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, as Dean of Harvard Law School, I not infrequently send e-mails to the community of students, staff, and faculty. I do not generally understand these communications to be publications of the kind requested here. But my e-mails on one subject — the Solomon Amendment — sometimes have been quoted, or reprinted in their entirety, in various public fora, so I am including all e-mails to the HLS community on that topic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">b. Please supply four (4) copies of any reports, memoranda or policy statements you prepared or contributed in the preparation of on behalf of any bar association, committee, conference, or organization of which you were or are a member.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I cannot recall having prepared or contributed directly in the preparation of any such report.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York State Commission on Higher Education, on which I served, issued a Final Report of Findings and Recommendations in June 2008. The report is available at www.hecommission.state.ny.us[http://www.hecommission.state.ny.us/].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Boston Bar Association Diversity Leadership Task Force, on which I served, published a final report and recommendations on November 18, 2008. I am including it as an attachment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American Law Deans Association, on whose board I sit, issues occasional statements and reports about matters of concern to law schools.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chicago Council of Lawyers, on whose Board of Governors I served from 1993 to 1995, regularly issues reports on judicial candidates and nominees in Illinois, as well as on other matters of interest to the local legal community.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">c. Please supply four (4) copies of any testimony, official statements or other communications relating, in whole or in part, to matters of public policy or legal interpretation, that you have issued or provided or that others presented on your behalf to public bodies or public officials.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have never provided fonnal testimony to any public body.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I joined a letter from Law School Deans, dated February 14,2007, calling for an increase in the compensation of federal judges.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I signed a letter with three other law deans to Senator Patrick Leahy, dated November 14,2005, opposing the Graham Amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill insofar as it would have stripped the federal courts of jurisdiction to hear habeas petitions brought by detainees at Guantanamo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I joined a Statement by Law School Deans, dated May 4, 2005, opposing threats of retaliation against federal judges and asserting the importance of an independent judiciary.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On June 17,2002, I provided a briefletter to Senator Paul Sarbanes concluding that a provision of the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Act of 2002 ("Sarbanes-Oxley") likely would survive a challenge brought under the Appointments Clause of Article II of the Constitution.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have tried to identify, through the search of calendars, computer files, and hard files, as well as publicly available electronic databases, all talks I have given of the kind described. I am providing written texts and handwritten notes where I have them. In the many appearances I make as dean, I usually get some material from my staff and then speak either without any notes or with handwritten notes, which I typically discard. Many of these events are reported on by university publications or taped by the law school. I am providing copies of any articles I have found on these events (where such articles exist, the list below states "press provided"), and I am indicating where tapes are on file at Harvard Law School.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between July and November 1988, I worked as a researcher for the Dukakis for President campaign.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My legal career (following two years of clerking) has had a number of distinct stages. From 1989 to 1991, I served as an associate at <span class="companylink">Williams &amp; Connolly</span>, a Washington, D.C. law finn. I handled a mix of commercial litigation, First Amendment litigation, and criminal matters at the firm. From 1991 to 1995, I was a professor at the University of Chicago; my principal scholarship during that time was in the field of constitutional law. I took one summer off during that period to serve as special counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee, working on the nomination of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the U.S. Supreme Court. From 1995 to 1999, I worked at the White House, first in the Counsel's Office and then in the Domestic Policy Council (DPC). In the Counsel's Office, I primarily acted as a lawyer for the White House policy councils and legislative office. In the DPC, I played a role in the formulation, advocacy, and implementation of law and policy in areas ranging from education to crime to public health. Between 1999 and 2003, I again served as a professor, but at Harvard Law School; my scholarship and teaching during these years focused on constitutional and administrative law. Starting in 2003, I have served as the dean of Harvard Law School. In this capacity, I oversee every aspect of the institution, academic and non-academic alike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ii. your typical clients and the areas, if any, in which you have specialized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have had private clients only during the time I was an associate at <span class="companylink">Williams &amp; Connolly</span>. Those clients included business entities in civil litigation, press organizations defending themselves in libel and related actions, and white-collar criminal defendants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">c. Describe the percentage of your practice that has been in litigation and whether you appeared in court frequently, occasionally, or not at all. If the frequency of your appearances in court varied, describe such variance, providing dates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only part of my practice that involved litigation was my work as an associate at <span class="companylink">Williams &amp; Connolly</span> between 1989 and 1991. I appeared in court occasionally during that time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">i. Indicate the percentage of your practice in: 1. federal courts; 2. state courts of record; 3. other courts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The litigation practice noted above occurred primarily in federal court.</p>

Please supply four (4) copies of any briefs, amicus or otherwise, and, if applicable, any oral argument transcripts before the Supreme Court in connection with your practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have not practiced before the Supreme Court as counsel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With many of my faculty colleagues, I joined an amicus brief in the Supreme Court (as well as in the Third Circuit) in support of FAIR in its suit against Secretary Rumsfeld challenging the Solomon Amendment, which governs universities' treatment of military recruiters. I did not participate in the drafting of this brief. Whereas the main argument in the case was constitutional, the amicus brief presented a statutory argument - that the Amendment did not require universities to make special exemptions for the military to neutral and generally applicable recruiting rules. The Supreme Court unanimously rejected all claims, constitutional and statutory alike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">16. Litigation: Describe the ten (10) most significant litigated matters which you personally handled.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(a) <span class="companylink">Federal Realty Investment Trust</span> v. Pacific Insurance Co., No. R-88-3658. We represented a real estate investment trust in an action against an insurer for the costs of defense associated with a prior litigation. I began work on the case in the middle of the litigation; I did some late discovery and drafted most of the pre-trial motions. On the eve of trial, Judge Nonnan Ramsey of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland ruled in favor of our position on the appropriate standard for allocating defense costs between covered and uncovered parties and claims (760 F. Supp. 533 (1991)). This ruling immediately produced a settlement favorable to our client.</p>

We represented Seatrain Lines, Inc., a debtor in bankruptcy, in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York (Judge Burton Lifland presiding) in connection with an application by Chase Manhattan Bank and Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy for legal fees associated with the bankruptcy case. In response to the filing of the fee application, our client counterclaimed against Chase for the recovery of the costs of preserving and disposing of certain properties subject to Chase's security interest. I handled some of the discovery and drafted most of the pleadings. When the court denied Chase's motion to strike our counterclaim (and a subsequent motion for reconsideration), the parties settled on terms favorable to our client.</p>

We represented <span class="companylink">Southeast Toyota Distributors, Inc</span>. in a suit brought by one of its franchisees alleging fraud, intentional interference with contract, violations of RICO, and a host of other claims. I drafted numerous pleadings in the case, including an opposition to the plaintiffs motion to remand (granted by Judge Hamilton of the U.S. District Court for South Carolina at 713 F. Supp. 898 (1989)), as well as motions to dismiss and discovery motions (ruled on by Judge Edwin Cottingham of the Court of Common Pleas for Darlington County). I also handled some of the discovery. I left the finn prior to trial. Ultimately, a verdict for the plaintiff was dismissed on appeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(d) Byrd v. Randi, No. MJG-89-636. We represented defendant <span class="companylink">Montcalm Publishing Corp</span>. in a libel action arising from an allegation that the plaintiff was in prison for child molestation. The case presented issues relating to the "libel-proof plaintiff' doctrine, the definition of a "limited purpose public figure," and the actual malice standard. I did most of the discovery, drafted our summary judgment motion and other pleadings, and argued the summary judgment motion before the district court. After initially denying the motion, Judge Marvin Garbis of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland dismissed the case a few months later on a motion for reconsideration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(e) In Re Application of <span class="companylink">News World Communications, Inc</span>., Nos. 89-3160, 89-212. We represented the Washington Post and WRC-TV in this effort to compel release to the public of unredacted transcripts of audiotapes to be received in evidence at a criminal trial. I argued motions before Judge Charles Richey of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to compel release of the transcripts and to prevent redaction. Judge Richey granted both motions, with the latter reported at 17 Media L. Rep. 1001 (1989). The Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit, with Judges Wald, Silbennan, and Sentelle hearing argument, denied a motion to stay this order (17 Media L. Rep. 1004 (1989)).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(f) J. Odell Anders v. Newsweek, Inc., No. 90-715. We represented Newsweek, Inc. on appeal from a jury verdict in its favor in a libel action filed in the Southem District of Mississippi. The case raised questions about the actual malice standard, as well as numerous evidentiary issues. I drafted the appellate brief urging affirmance. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held in our favor by unpublished opinion (judgment reported at 949 F.2d 1159 (1991)).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(g) Luke Records, Inc. v. Nick Navarro, No. 90-5508. We filed an amicus brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit on behalf of the Recording Industry Association of America and numerous record companies, challenging the decision of the district court that a musical recording was obscene under the standard set forth by the Supreme Court in Miller v. California. I drafted the brief in the case, which stressed the difficulty of holding music obscene under prevailing constitutional law. Judge Lively, joined by Judges Anderson and Roney, reversed the district court's decision (960 F.2d 134 (1992)).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(h) Bagbey v. National Enquirer, No. CV 89-2177. We represented the National Enquirer in this libel action brought by a person mistakenly identified in the publication as being Jimmy Swaggert's father. I drafted all pleadings and did all discovery in the case, which began in Louisiana state court but which we removed to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana (Judge F.A. Little, Jr.). We eventually settled the case on tenns favorable to our client.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(i) Chuang v. United States, No. 89-1309. We represented Joseph Chuang, a former bank president, on his appeal from a criminal conviction for numerous counts of bank fraud. The principle issues in the case concerned the propriety of two warrantless searches of the bank, one by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and one by the FDIC. I drafted most sections of the brief, which argued among other matters (1) that the statute authorizing the OCC's search failed to provide a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant, as required by the Supreme Court, and (2) that the FDIC's search was invalid because it went beyond the bank premises into Chuang's law finn offices. The Second Circuit affirmed the conviction, with Judge Timbers writing and Judges Newman and Altimari joining (897 F.2d 646 (1990)).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(j) United States v. Jarrett Woods, We represented the fonner head of the Westem Savings Association, a failed savings and loan, in both a grand jury investigation and a number of civil suits brought against him. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board had declared the S&amp;L insolvent and placed it in receivership after discovering various suspect real estate loans. In addition to trying to keep the civil suits at bay, we tracked the grand jury investigation of Woods closely for more than a year - interviewing each of the many people brought before the grand jury - before Woods became unable to afford the representation. Woods was subsequently indicted and convicted of numerous counts of bank fraud.</p>

</div><div class="author">By M.P. McQueen   </div><div>893 words</div><div>8 May 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are you overlooking a commercial real-estate boom?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If your definition of the category is limited to splashy office parks and shopping malls, both of which took a pounding during the financial crisis and haven't fully recovered, then you probably are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But think a little smaller—like fast food-restaurants, convenience stores and gas stations—and the returns get bigger. Such ventures, known as triple-net-lease properties, are "the best-performing sector of the commercial real estate marketplace," says David Bailin, head of global managed investments for Citi Private Bank, which serves ultra-high-net-worth clients. "It is the sector that lost the least value [during the recession] and rallied the quickest."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Triple-net-lease properties are usually freestanding buildings in which a tenant agrees to take responsibility for maintenance, taxes and insurance during a long lease—leaving the investor with little to do but collect checks. Investors typically buy individual properties through commercial real-estate brokers like Marcus &amp; Millichap, <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group</span> or others, either alone or in limited partnerships with a few other investors, and then lease them out to occupants such as drug store chains, quick-serve restaurants, convenience and dollar stores, medical outfits, and in some cases big-box retailers like <span class="companylink">Costco</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Triple-net-lease properties are generating annual returns of as much as 12% these days, estimates Bernard J. Haddigan, managing director of Marcus &amp; Millichap Real Estate Investment Services' National Retail Group. Individual investors and small groups of partners generally invest $300,000 to $5 million per building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some publicly traded real-estate investment trusts concentrate on triple-net-lease properties, too. They returned 16.9% during the first quarter—compared with 11.1% for Dow Jones Equity All REIT Index, which includes all types of commercial and residential property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Triple-net properties suffered during the recession, but less than other types of real estate. Whereas overall commercial prices fell by about 40% during 2007-09, prices for triple-net properties fell by about 15%, according to Mr. Haddigan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like all kinds of investing, triple-net-lease plays are based on risk: the more you're willing to take, the greater the potential returns. There are several important factors that determine a triple net deal's riskiness: the creditworthiness of the tenant, the location, physical condition and functionality of the property, and the remaining term on a lease (shorter is riskier). Also important: the "occupancy cost" or "health ratio," defined as the percentage that the tenant pays in rent relative to store sales. (The lower the ratio, the better.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides overall economic risk, there's the risk of picking a tenant whose product or service might fall out of favor. Changing consumer trends can wipe out cash cows, as happened with some video-rental stores during the last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You need a good tenant," says Jeffrey Rogers, president and chief operating officer of Integra Realty Resources, a commercial real-estate appraisal and consulting firm that doesn't own or broker real estate. "Then you need an optimal location and to know what the market rent is. That is absolutely key."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors who lack the time or inclination to invest in triple-net-lease properties directly can get into the category via REITs such as the publicly traded <span class="companylink">Realty Income Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Lexington Realty Trust</span> in New York, as well as American Realty Capital Trust in Jenkintown, Pa., which is not traded on a stock exchange. These REITs invest mainly in triple-net properties, and they're generally sold through broker-dealers. They sometimes have minimum-net-worth and other requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with most income properties, investors can come out ahead—or behind—on triple-net properties in two ways: through price appreciation and income. The best measure of income potential is the so-called capitalization rate, or the net operating income divided by the purchase price of a property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, cap rates have been falling because property prices nationally are rebounding. More investors are going after fewer high-quality properties, driving prices up. This is considered a positive sign for the broader commercial real estate market—but it means the easy money in triple-net-lease properties might be coming to an end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is still opportunity for savvy investors. Michael K. Federman, 38 years old, is an attorney in New York who began investing in triple-net properties in 2004, during the previous recession. His first acquisitions were fried-chicken restaurants in upstate New York, followed by a Circle K convenience store in Arizona. He later sold the Circle K and purchased more buildings, and currently owns a portfolio of 15 properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A self-professed "conservative" investor, Mr. Federman now concentrates primarily on single-tenant properties, he says. Most recently, he and a business partner in March purchased a long-term lease property for about $4 million housing a <span class="companylink">Chipotle Mexican Grill</span> in Lower Manhattan with a cap rate of 8.5%. That return was in line with the national average for casual dining restaurants in 2009, according to Marcus &amp; Millichap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For me it was a perfect deal," he says, "because it combined prime real estate, stellar credit and minimal management responsibilities."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the air escaped from the Manhattan real-estate bubble, a mix of art, culture and design was often the centerpiece for marketing many expensive condominium projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, brokers say, buyers are turning their backs on such gimmicks. Instead, they're rediscovering basics: location, square footage, ceiling heights and solidly built with what brokers call "good bones."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowhere has the shift been more visible that at 650 Sixth Ave., a handsome, 19th-century stone-and-brick loft building where condominiums went on the market in 2007 after conversion from offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of celebrating the interior cast-iron columns or the neo-Renaissance arched windows, Michael Shvo, the building's hard-charging broker, captured the moment with a marketing campaign built on what he called "white-box gallery living."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sales stalled. The developers tried another broker, then another and finally, in March, a fourth. Now the building has been rebranded and relaunched as a neo-Rennaissance classic tinged with history and tradition. Sales have rebounded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story of 650 Sixth in many ways reflects what is now a bygone era. Buyers used to have confidence in a rising market, and were willing to put down hefty deposits on the strength of a floor plan, a celebrity architect and a high-fashion designer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now they want to see the finished product and know whether they can get a mortgage before they sign on the dotted line. "You can no longer sell a dream," said Dolly Lenz, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, "and you can't get financing for a dream."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shvo, in an interview. said his concept for the project was "always a good one." Sales stalled, he said, because of delays in completing the renovation and problems in quality and finishes that were amplified because of the white-on-white asthetic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the beginning, Mr. Shvo envisioned 650 Fifth as an artsy building for the aspirational elite. There was art gallery space in the lobby. The condo units carried the white theme from bleached white oak floors to the white Poggenpohl cabinets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were also white glass backsplashes, white counters, white furniture and cold white walls, providing a perfect backdrop for an art collection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space was a "blank canvas," Mr. Shvo said at the time. All buyers needed to do was add their own art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was an early burst of contract signing, but when sales stalled in 2008—even before the collapse of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> that triggered a sales freeze in many buildings—Mr. Shvo was succeeded by <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>, and then by Prudential Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a fourth sales team was hired, Mr. Shvo's high-minded concept was finally reined in: In model apartments, the floors were stripped and darkened with walnut stain. Walls were repainted a warm white. The white cast-iron pillars became metallic gray.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, three years after Mr. Shvo launched the project, a white wall was even repainted a different color—a warm brown for accent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shaun Osher, the head of Core, a Manhattan-based brokerage that now has taken over sales at the project, said the original marketing campaign was like "oil and water" in trying to be artsy while ignoring the appeal of an unusual, landmark building and the surrounding Chelsea neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It wasn't about all the things that a buyer should be thinking about," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was about fancy, shmancy marketing. This is a beautiful loft building. It needs to be celebrated as such."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shvo still thinks his idea for the building was solid. "There is nothing more difficult to build than white space," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shvo was one of a group of marketers who, during the boom years, borrowed a page from fashion and cosmetics marketing to sell new condominiums as lifestyle choices that prized culture over mere brick and mortar, stone and glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 650 Sixth building was purchased by Penterium, the residential development unit of a Korean company, Kumkang Housing Corp., for $70.5 million in 2006. El-Ad Properties, the developer of the Plaza Hotel, had purchased it a year earlier and flipped it for a 50% gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Osher's conservative reimagining for the building also included renaming it as the Cammeyer, for A. J. Cammeyer, who operated a shoe store there in 1897. That historic detail is featured in the Landmarks Preservation Commission's report on the property.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the air escaped from the Manhattan real-estate bubble, a mix of art, culture and design was often the centerpiece for marketing many expensive condominium projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, brokers say, buyers are turning their backs on such gimmicks. Instead, they're rediscovering basics: location, square footage, ceiling heights and solidly built with what brokers call "good bones."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowhere has the shift been more visible that at 650 Sixth Ave., a handsome, 19th-century stone-and-brick loft building where condominiums went on the market in 2007 after conversion from offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of celebrating the interior cast-iron columns or the neo-Renaissance arched windows, Michael Shvo, the building's hard-charging broker, captured the moment with a marketing campaign built on what he called "white-box gallery living."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sales stalled. The developers tried another broker, then another and finally, in March, a fourth. Now the building has been rebranded and relaunched as a neo-Rennaissance classic tinged with history and tradition. Sales have rebounded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story of 650 Sixth in many ways reflects what is now a bygone era. Buyers used to have confidence in a rising market, and were willing to put down hefty deposits on the strength of a floor plan, a celebrity architect and a high-fashion designer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now they want to see the finished product and know whether they can get a mortgage before they sign on the dotted line. "You can no longer sell a dream," said Dolly Lenz, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, "and you can't get financing for a dream."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shvo, in an interview. said his concept for the project was "always a good one." Sales stalled, he said, because of delays in completing the renovation and problems in quality and finishes that were amplified because of the white-on-white asthetic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the beginning, Mr. Shvo envisioned 650 Fifth as an artsy building for the aspirational elite. There was art gallery space in the lobby. The condo units carried the white theme from bleached white oak floors to the white Poggenpohl cabinets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were also white glass backsplashes, white counters, white furniture and cold white walls, providing a perfect backdrop for an art collection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space was a "blank canvas," Mr. Shvo said at the time. All buyers needed to do was add their own art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was an early burst of contract signing, but when sales stalled in 2008 -- even before the collapse of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> that triggered a sales freeze in many buildings -- Mr. Shvo was succeeded by <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>, and then by Prudential Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a fourth sales team was hired, Mr. Shvo's high-minded concept was finally reined in: In model apartments, the floors were stripped and darkened with walnut stain. Walls were repainted a warm white. The white cast-iron pillars became metallic gray.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, three years after Mr. Shvo launched the project, a white wall was even repainted a different color -- a warm brown for accent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shaun Osher, the head of Core, a Manhattan-based brokerage that now has taken over sales at the project, said the original marketing campaign was like "oil and water" in trying to be artsy while ignoring the appeal of an unusual, landmark building and the surrounding Chelsea neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It wasn't about all the things that a buyer should be thinking about," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was about fancy, shmancy marketing. This is a beautiful loft building. It needs to be celebrated as such."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shvo still thinks his idea for the building was solid. "There is nothing more difficult to build than white space," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shvo was one of a group of marketers who, during the boom years, borrowed a page from fashion and cosmetics marketing to sell new condominiums as lifestyle choices that prized culture over mere brick and mortar, stone and glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 650 Sixth building was purchased by Penterium, the residential development unit of a Korean company, Kumkang Housing Corp., for $70.5 million in 2006. El-Ad Properties, the developer of the Plaza Hotel, had purchased it a year earlier and flipped it for a 50% gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Osher's conservative reimagining for the building also included renaming it as the Cammeyer, for A. J. Cammeyer, who operated a shoe store there in 1897. That historic detail is featured in the Landmarks Preservation Commission's report on the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Shvo's firm left the project in 2008, he said that 35% of the building's 67 apartments were under contract. Property records show that so far only 20 units have closed, including some that went under contract after Mr. Shvo left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, eight more are under contract, Mr. Osher said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sara Murray   </div><div>710 words</div><div>5 May 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for manufactured goods are surging, with another jump in March, and business spending continues to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders for factory goods rose 1.3% to $391.5 billion, the 11th increase in the past 12 months, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Orders increased 1.3% in February as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The March results were led by a rise in orders for nondurable goods, items designed to last less than three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim Quinlan, a <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Securities</span> economist, said the manufacturing sector is surpassing "even optimistic outlooks" as it snaps back from a deep recession. But "I think it's definitely early to break out the champagne corks," he added, noting that orders are still only 44% of the way back to the levels recorded in the summer of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for durable goods fell 0.6% in March instead of the originally reported 1.3% decline. Nondurable goods orders rose 2.9% from paper products, chemicals and petroleum, among others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for manufactured goods excluding transportation rose 3.1%; for manufactured goods excluding the defense sector, 1.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also included positive signs for business investment. Nondefense orders for capital goods excluding aircraft, which economists consider a good measure of capital spending, rose 4.5% in March. Shipments of those goods increased 2.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories rose 0.3%, marking the third month in a row of increases, and economists concluded that businesses are finished shedding inventories and have once again begun adding to their stockpiles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department report mirrors the manufacturing strength that was evident in the latest Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index. It rose to 60.4 in April from 59.6 in March, as the sector continues to expand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, Americans increased their contract signings on previously owned homes for a second straight month in March, as government tax relief boosted demand in the recovering housing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' index for pending sales of used homes rose by 5.3% to 102.9, the industry group said Tuesday. The index was 21.1% above its level of 85.0 in March 2009. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected pending home sales would climb by 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">February pending home sales were revised slightly up, with the index rising 8.3% to 97.7. Originally, the NAR had said the gauge rose 8.2% to 97.6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR index is based on pending sales of existing homes, including single-family homes and condominiums. A home sale is pending when the contract has been signed but the transaction hasn't closed. Pending sales typically close within one or two months of signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax relief and low borrowing costs have helped the housing market struggle against high unemployment, which is discouraging consumers from big purchases. "Clearly, the home buyer tax credit has helped stabilize the market," NAR economist Lawrence Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The credit, the second of two enacted in a year, expired last Friday, and the NAR expects lower sales for a while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Later in the second half of the year, and into 2011, home sales will likely become self-sustaining if the economy can add jobs at a respectable pace, and from a return of buyer demand as they see home values stabilizing," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its monthly forecast on the industry, the NAR projected existing-home sales of 5.38 million this year and 5.66 million in 2011. That compares with 5.16 million in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices are also picking up, the NAR said. The median price for an existing home is forecast at $176,900 in 2010 and $183,400 in 2011. It was $172,500 in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, pending sales in the Northeast fell 3.3% in March but were 27.2% higher than a year earlier. The Midwest climbed 1.2% in March and was 18.5% higher than a year earlier. Pending sales in the South rose 12.7% in March and were 28.3% above March 2009. The West increased 1.9% in March and was 8.8% higher than a year earlier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Brooklyn Boulders LLC opened in September, the rock-climbing business's owners purposely left a Daily News logo above its entrance, hoping the facility's former identity as a delivery-truck garage for the New York newspaper would help draw visitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The character and history" of the property definitely make the business more marketable, says Stephen Spaeth, one of Brooklyn Boulders' three co-owners. Several New York publications, including the Daily News, ran stories that mentioned the start-up's original occupant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business owners often find unique ways to repurpose buildings: They've transformed jails into hotels, roller rinks into retail shops and churches into restaurants. Many credit their establishments' incongruent past in part for their success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those looking to take up the strategy can potentially find bargains as other businesses shutter and leave attractive properties behind. Office and retail property prices in the fourth quarter were down 31% and 26%, respectively, from two years ago, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Investor Services Inc. And some properties may qualify for tax credits if they're designated historic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But investing in a property can require a significant chunk of cash, and financing remains difficult to obtain. "It's the Catch-22 of all real estate today because you've got property you can acquire at extremely low prices, but the parties you usually go to for financing are running in the opposite direction," says Tom Kirschbraun, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Inc</span>., a real-estate services firm based in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors say they are seeing some bargains. A vacant New Orleans office building constructed in the early 1900s was sold last month for $5.5 million, about $2 million less than what it was appraised for in 2005, says Richard Juge, president of RE/MAX Commercial Brokers Inc., based in Metairie, La.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer, Mark Wyant, owner of a local small construction business, says he plans to turn the building into a luxury hotel while maintaining its original architecture, including granite and scrollwork exteriors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property qualifies for between $3 million and $5 million in state and federal tax credits because of its historic status, says Mr. Wyant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To buy the Charles Street Jail in Boston in late 2007, where the Boston Strangler and other criminals were allegedly once held prisoner, Dick Friedman says his small real-estate development firm, Carpenter &amp; Company Inc., teamed up with an investor and tapped equity, $15 million in state and federal tax credits, a bank loan and personal savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 150,000-square-foot luxury inn, which includes a restaurant and bar, now makes about $40 million in annual sales, according to Mr. Friedman. "People are fascinated with its history," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But renovation costs on a property originally designed for another purpose can add up. Brooklyn Boulders' Mr. Spaeth says it cost about $1 million to fix up the delivery-truck garage, which is leased, and Liberty Hotel's Mr. Friedman says the total tab for transforming the 169-year-old formal penal facility—including the cost of the property—was about $120 million. "It's not for the faint of heart," says Mr. Friedman of doing a major overhaul of a property. "But I think it's worth it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mary Liz Curtin and Stephen Scannell's furniture and gift shop, Leon &amp; Lulu LLC, used to be a roller rink and Motown concert venue. They bought the place in 2005 for $750,000 and added $255,000 in renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They kept the 69-year-old property's original flooring, benches, trophy cases, scoreboard and signage. On weekends and during special events, employees skate through the aisles to serve coffee and cookies to shoppers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year the Clawson, Mich., company posted about $2 million in sales, a 20% increase from 2008, according to Ms. Curtin. "We get letters from people who thank us for keeping the history alive," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business owners can sometimes run into problems obtaining basic operating permits, warns Alan Shor, president of the Retail Connection LP, a retail real-estate firm based in Dallas. Any business "that might impact children, traffic or even the look of the neighborhood" could face opposition from local lawmakers, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Morrison, who owns Mission Restaurant, a Syracuse, N.Y., eatery housed in a former Wesleyan Methodist church that was an alleged stop on the Underground Railroad, ran into such a problem. A local law prohibits the sale of hard liquor within less than 200 feet of a church—an active one—and he's within that range of a Baptist church. "I can only sell beer and wine," he gripes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An establishment's idiosyncratic past may not always be an advantage. Hair stylist Randy Fotia says he usually avoids mentioning that his salon was once a funeral home unless clients inquire about a photo on the cash register showing its original facade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some people get creeped out by that," says Mr. Fotia, who purchased the Highland Park, N.J., property in 1992 at a below-market rate with a mortgage he's long since paid off. "I've always liked it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fotia says he spent close to $500,000 renovating the salon, now called All Is Vanity, and the apartment above it, where he lives. Clients are typically unaware when using the bathroom in the basement that bodies were once embalmed down there. "People say they've gotten weird vibes," says Mr. Fotia. But "no ghosts."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK—The dollar gained Monday, reaching its highest level against the yen since August, as better-than-expected readings on manufacturing activity and construction spending showed the U.S. economic recovery is gathering pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is in contrast to the euro zone, where worries about the implementation of an unprecedented €110 billion ($146.5 billion) aid package for Greece overshadowed strong manufacturing data. The euro dropped below $1.32 and was at risk of falling toward its one-year lows just above $1.31 before rebounding slightly in afternoon trading. The common currency was down 0.8% against the greenback by late Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Greek bailout "may help stave off immediate default," said Carl Forcheski, director of foreign exchange at <span class="companylink">Société Générale</span> in New York, but "it was greeted with skepticism, as grave doubts remain the Greek government will be able to enact the severe austerity measures mandated by the package."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late Monday, the euro was at $1.3194, down from $1.3314 late Friday. The dollar was at 94.60 yen, up from 93.93 yen, while the euro was at 124.81 yen, off from 125.06 yen. The pound was at $1.5244, down from $1.5299. The dollar was at 1.0859 Swiss francs, up from 1.0762 francs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are concerned Greece's debt woes could spill across the euro-zone periphery, infecting already stressed Portugal and Spain, for instance. These worries will keep the euro under pressure, analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Individual parliaments within the euro zone must also agree to fund their portions of the lifeline to Greece, with investors keeping a particular eye on Germany, where the bailout has been contentious. European Union heads of state are slated to meet Friday to give final approval for the lifeline to Greece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The better-than-expected U.S. data added to the pressure on the euro. A reading on U.S. manufacturing activity in April showed the best result since July 2004, and construction spending in March increased for the first time in five months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. data also helped the dollar advance on the Japanese yen, with the greenback up nearly 0.8% on the day. Japan is struggling with lagging growth and has a central bank that has discussed injecting more money into a sagging economy, as opposed to the U.S., where the Federal Reserve is expected to begin mopping up excess liquidity as the economy recovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trading in currency markets was thin because of market holidays in the U.K., Japan and China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, a report issued Monday showed foreign-exchange trading volume slid roughly 6% to just under $100 trillion last year, according to <span class="companylink">Greenwich Associates</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline marked the end of a run that saw new records for volume in each of the prior two years. The second quarter of 2009 was the start of the slowdown in currency markets, as world financial markets began to stabilize, the report said. Lower volatility generally slows foreign-exchange trading as market participants move toward other asset classes. Leading the decline in foreign-exchange volumes, hedge-fund trading fell 23% in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenwich's $100 trillion figure represents a small portion of the universe of currency trading. It is based on the group's interviews with approximately 1,500 end-user foreign-exchange clients from around the world. The survey doesn't include big-bank or interdealer volume. Total currency-trading volume is estimated at $3.2 trillion a day, according to data collected by the Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro dropped against the dollar Monday, as longer-term concern over euro-zone sovereign debt contrasted with strong U.S. economic data that helped the dollar rise to its highest level against the yen since August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. data, which showed a strong reading in manufacturing and construction spending, illustrated a U.S. economy that continues to drag itself out of the doldrums. This compares with the euro zone, where investors worried about the implementation of an unprecedented €110 billion ($146.5 billion) aid package for Greece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late-afternoon trade in New York, the euro was at $1.3194 from $1.3314 late Friday. The dollar was at 94.60 yen from 93.93 yen, while the euro was at 124.81 yen from 125.06 yen. The U.K. pound was at $1.5245 from $1.5299, while the dollar was at 1.0851 Swiss francs from 1.0762 francs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worries about whether Greece's woes would spread to other euro-zone countries helped send gold to its highest level in five months. The contract for May delivery gained $2.60 per troy ounce, or 0.2%, to $1,182.70 in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most European stock markets ended higher, as gains on Wall Street offset lingering worries over whether the Greek bailout package will stop the debt crisis from spreading to other euro-zone nations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stoxx Europe 600 index edged up 0.3% to close at 260.56, erasing its earlier losses. Germany's DAX index gained 0.5% to 6166.92, and France's CAC-40 index added 0.3% to 3828.46. Markets in the U.K. were closed for a holiday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks in the U.S. were trading higher at the time of the European close, boosted by the announcement of confirmation of a long-awaited all-stock merger between <span class="companylink">Continental Airlines</span> and <span class="companylink">United Airlines</span> parent UAL.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro dropped against the dollar Monday, as longer-term concern over euro-zone sovereign debt contrasted with strong U.S. economic data that helped the dollar rise to its highest level against the yen since August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. data, which showed a strong reading in manufacturing and construction spending, illustrated a U.S. economy that continues to drag itself out of the doldrums. This compares with the euro zone, where investors worried about the implementation of an unprecedented 110 billion euro ($146.5 billion) aid package for Greece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late-afternoon trade in New York, the euro was at $1.3194 from $1.3314 late Friday. The dollar was at 94.60 yen from 93.93 yen, while the euro was at 124.81 yen from 125.06 yen. The U.K. pound was at $1.5245 from $1.5299, while the dollar was at 1.0851 Swiss francs from 1.0762 francs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worries about whether Greece's woes would spread to other euro-zone countries helped send gold to its highest level in five months. The contract for May delivery gained $2.60 per troy ounce, or 0.2%, to $1,182.70 in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most European stock markets ended higher, as gains on Wall Street offset lingering worries over whether the Greek bailout package will stop the debt crisis from spreading to other euro-zone nations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stoxx Europe 600 index edged up 0.3% to close at 260.56, erasing its earlier losses. Germany's DAX index gained 0.5% to 6166.92, and France's CAC-40 index added 0.3% to 3828.46. Markets in the U.K. were closed for a holiday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks in the U.S. were trading higher at the time of the European close, boosted by the announcement of confirmation of a long-awaited all-stock merger between <span class="companylink">Continental Airlines</span> and <span class="companylink">United Airlines</span> parent UAL. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 143.22 points, or 1.3%, at 11151.83.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European equities tracked those gains on Monday after data showed that conditions for U.S. manufacturers improved again in April to the highest level since June 2004.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumer spending rose twice as fast as income in March as saving dropped to its lowest level in 18 months and a closely watched indicator of inflation remained stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, U.S. factory activity strengthened in April, with the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index rising to 60.4 from 59.6 a month earlier. Meanwhile, U.S. construction spending defied expectations and rose for the first time in five months during March as an increase in the commercial sector offset continued weakness in housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal income rose 0.3% in March as a weak labor market continued to keep a lid on wage growth, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, consumer spending -- which accounts for 70% of demand in the U.S. economy -- increased by 0.6% from the prior month, likely lifted by government efforts to spur economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires were expecting income to rise by 0.3% and spending to rise by 0.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With income growth sluggish, U.S. consumers slowed their pace of saving in March. Americans in March saved $303.9 billion as the national saving rate slid to 2.7% from 3% the previous month. The saving rate is at its lowest level since September 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The core price index for personal consumption expenditures, which excludes food and energy prices because of their volatility, advanced 0.1% in March. On a year-over-year basis, that figure stood at 1.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The core price index for personal consumption expenditures is among the inflation indicators most closely watched by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which at its latest policy meeting kept key interest rates unchanged, noting that inflationary pressures remain subdued. The Commerce Department report showed the PCE price index including food and energy prices rose 0.1% in March was up 2% on a year-over-year basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commerce revised income and spending data for February, saying incomes grew 0.1% as spending rose 0.5%. Commerce initially said income posted no growth in February while spending rose 0.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. factory-sector activity continued to accelerate in April, turning in the best performance since July 2004. The ISM report said that its index of manufacturing activity had a solid month, at 60.4, from 59.6 in March and 56.5 in February. Readings over 50 indicate expansion. Economists predicted the index would come in at a robust 60.1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. factory sector has been one of the consistent bright spots, and like many rebounds, it has been leading the way out of the worst economic downturn in decades. "Manufacturers continue to see extraordinary strength in new orders," said Norbert Ore, who compiles the survey for the research group.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- The euro fell against the dollar Monday, failing to gain traction after an unprecedented bailout plan for Greece won approval over the weekend, and falling further on the back of better-than-expected U.S. data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. data, which showed a strong reading in manufacturing and construction spending, illustrates a U.S. economy continuing to drag itself from the doldrums, contrasting with the euro zone, where sovereign-debt problems weighed on the common currency, despite the lifeline to Greece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is still struggling to take on board the austerity plan" for Greece, said Vassili Serebriakov, foreign-exchange strategist at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors also worry Greece's debt woes could spill across the euro-zone periphery, infecting already-stressed Portugal and Spain, for instance. These worries keep the euro under pressure, Mr. Serebriakov said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early-afternoon trade, the euro was at $1.3194 from $1.3314 late Friday. The dollar was at 94.68 yen from 93.93 yen, while the euro was at 124.92 yen from 125.06 yen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.K. pound was at $1.5252 from $1.5299. The dollar was at 1.0857 Swiss francs from 1.0762 francs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are squarely zeroed in on Greece, analysts said, and whether legislatures in individual euro-zone states will agree to fund the 110 billion euros ($146.5 billion) bailout. European Union heads of state are supposed to meet Friday to give final approval to the lifeline to Greece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risk premiums required by investors to buy the government bonds of euro-zone nations with large budget deficits fell Monday in the wake of the Greek bailout agreement, only slightly, but the euro was unable to sustain any gains on the back of the plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An announcement from the European Central Bank that it would suspend indefinitely the minimum credit-rating threshold for collateral eligibility requirements for Greek sovereign debt also failed to give the euro additional support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ECB will continue to accept as collateral all new and outstanding bonds issued or guaranteed by the Greek government however far they are downgraded by the international ratings agencies. Earlier this year, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet had pledged the central bank would never do any such thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to pressure on the euro was better-than-expected U.S. data, including a reading of factory-sector activity in April that showed its best performance since July 2004 and construction spending in March that increased for the first time in five months.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sara Murray </div><div>649 words</div><div>4 May 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing activity grew stronger in April, pointing to sustained growth in the sector, as both business and consumer spending rebounded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report by the Commerce Department confirmed that consumers opened their wallets in March, dipping into savings to increase spending faster than their incomes rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management survey of factory purchasing managers shows the expansion was broad-based, with 17 out of 18 industries surveyed experiencing growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall index for manufacturing activity climbed to 60.4 in April, up from 59.6 in March, and reflected underlying increases in production, new orders and employment. Any index reading above 50 shows manufacturing is expanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It really suggests the strength is sustainable," Michelle Girard, an RBS Securities Inc. analyst said of the report. "Now what's becoming evident is consumer and business spending is picking up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the positive details in the manufacturing report, the index for new orders rose by 4.2 points to 65.7, a sign that the sector's expansion wasn't solely relying on growth from businesses restocking inventories after deep drawdowns during the recession. In fact, the index for inventories actually contracted in April after expanding the prior month, but manufacturing activity continued to grow from increased demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While that growth is strong, Norbert Ore, chair of the survey committee, noted that manufacturing is rebounding from low levels, making the expansion appear particularly strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At some point manufacturing growth is likely to level out, experts said, though activity will likely remain at a "sustainable level of growth," even as the large gains slow, Mr. Ore said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The employment index was another highlight in the manufacturing report, rising 3.4 points to 58.5, though that may not indicate across-the-board hiring. Mr. Ore said some firms are showing a willingness to add shifts, but are shying away from large-scale hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some companies, however, are ramping up. <span class="companylink">General Electric Co</span>. announced Monday it has added 220 manufacturing jobs in Michigan to work in aviation producing jet engines. "We're seeing better orders across the board so we have lots of reason to be more optimistic," said Charlene Begley, a senior vice president for GE.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added that she understood many people were frustrated that job growth wasn't keeping up with the increases in orders and that more companies were relying on increased productivity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With that said I do think that we're starting to see a better economy and that jobs will follow," Ms. Begley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strength in the factory sector isn't translating into a surge of broad-based inflation. Experts said the increase wouldn't likely be passed to consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate inflation gauge showed that price pressures remain in check. The personal consumption expenditure index, the Federal Reserve's preference for tracking inflation, increased just 0.1% in March for both the all-inclusive measure as well as the measure that excludes volatile food and energy prices, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, inflation rose 2% over the past 12 months and is up just 1.3% excluding food and energy prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That same report showed that consumer spending increased 0.6%, twice as fast as income, which rose 0.3%. Spending also rose 0.5% in February and the rising trend prompted Nomura Global Economics analysts to increase their second quarter estimate for gross domestic product to 3.9% from 3.7%. Americans saved less though: The saving rate fell to 2.7% in March from 3% the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a separate report Monday showed construction spending also rose 0.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $847.3 billion in March compared to February, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, spending is 12.3% lower than the same time a year earlier.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Brooklyn Boulders LLC opened in September, the rock-climbing business's owners purposely left a Daily News logo above its entrance, hoping the facility's former identity as a delivery-truck garage for the New York newspaper would help draw visitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The character and history" of the property definitely make the business more marketable, says Stephen Spaeth, one of Brooklyn Boulders' three co-owners. Several New York publications, including the Daily News, ran stories that mentioned the start-up's original occupant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business owners often find unique ways to repurpose buildings: They've transformed jails into hotels, roller rinks into retail shops and churches into restaurants. Many credit their establishments' incongruent past in part for their success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those looking to take up the strategy can potentially find bargains as other businesses shutter and leave attractive properties behind. Office and retail property prices in the fourth quarter were down 31% and 26%, respectively, from two years ago, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Investor Services Inc. And some properties may qualify for tax credits if they're designated historic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But investing in a property can require a significant chunk of cash, and financing remains difficult to obtain. "It's the Catch-22 of all real estate today because you've got property you can acquire at extremely low prices, but the parties you usually go to for financing are running in the opposite direction," says Tom Kirschbraun, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Inc</span>., a real-estate services firm based in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors say they are seeing some bargains. A vacant New Orleans office building constructed in the early 1900s was sold last month for $5.5 million, about $2 million less than what it was appraised for in 2005, says Richard Juge, president of RE/MAX Commercial Brokers Inc., based in Metairie, La.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer, Mark Wyant, owner of a local small construction business, says he plans to turn the building into a luxury hotel while maintaining its original architecture, including granite and scrollwork exteriors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property qualifies for between $3 million and $5 million in state and federal tax credits because of its historic status, says Mr. Wyant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To buy the Charles Street Jail in Boston in late 2007, where the Boston Strangler and other criminals were allegedly once held prisoner, Dick Friedman says his small real-estate development firm, Carpenter &amp;Company Inc., teamed up with an investor and tapped equity, $15 million in state and federal tax credits, a bank loan and personal savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 150,000-square-foot luxury inn, which includes a restaurant and bar, now makes about $40 million in annual sales, according to Mr. Friedman. "People are fascinated with its history," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But renovation costs on a property originally designed for another purpose can add up. Brooklyn Boulders' Mr. Spaeth says it cost about $1 million to fix up the delivery-truck garage, which is leased, and Liberty Hotel's Mr. Friedman says the total tab for transforming the 169-year-old formal penal facility -- including the cost of the property -- was about $120 million. "It's not for the faint of heart," says Mr. Friedman of doing a major overhaul of a property. "But I think it's worth it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mary Liz Curtin and Stephen Scannell's furniture and gift shop, Leon &amp;Lulu LLC, used to be a roller rink and Motown concert venue. They bought the place in 2005 for $750,000 and added $255,000 in renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They kept the 69-year-old property's original flooring, benches, trophy cases, scoreboard and signage. On weekends and during special events, employees skate through the aisles to serve coffee and cookies to shoppers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year the Clawson, Mich., company posted about $2 million in sales, a 20% increase from 2008, according to Ms. Curtin. "We get letters from people who thank us for keeping the history alive," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business owners can sometimes run into problems obtaining basic operating permits, warns Alan Shor, president of the Retail Connection LP, a retail real-estate firm based in Dallas. Any business "that might impact children, traffic or even the look of the neighborhood" could face opposition from local lawmakers, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Morrison, who owns Mission Restaurant, a Syracuse, N.Y., eatery housed in a former Wesleyan Methodist church that was an alleged stop on the Underground Railroad, ran into such a problem. A local law prohibits the sale of hard liquor within less than 200 feet of a church -- an active one -- and he's within that range of a Baptist church. "I can only sell beer and wine," he gripes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An establishment's idiosyncratic past may not always be an advantage. Hair stylist Randy Fotia says he usually avoids mentioning that his salon was once a funeral home unless clients inquire about a photo on the cash register showing its original facade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some people get creeped out by that," says Mr. Fotia, who purchased the Highland Park, N.J., property in 1992 at a below-market rate with a mortgage he's long since paid off. "I've always liked it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fotia says he spent close to $500,000 renovating the salon, now called All Is Vanity, and the apartment above it, where he lives. Clients are typically unaware when using the bathroom in the basement that bodies were once embalmed down there. "People say they've gotten weird vibes," says Mr. Fotia. But "no ghosts."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel   </div><div>859 words</div><div>30 April 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property on the gritty western edges of Hell's Kitchen may never become as hot as the stretch of land abutting the High Line, the elevated former rail line in Chelsea that has become one of the city's most popular parks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a trench for subterranean railroad tracks cutting through Hell's Kitchen has given life to an unusual New York amenity: secret gardens that have helped close deals in the rough-hewn area during the city's real-estate slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tracks were built for the New York Central Railroad in the 1930s to divert freight trains from the middle of 11th Avenue, which had become so dangerous for pedestrians dodging trains that it was known as "Death Avenue."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trench runs through the neighborhood west of 10th Avenue, and while the freight traffic is gone, the rumble of Amtrak trains en route to and from Albany and points north can still be heard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the recent real-estate boom, the space above the trench was put to another use: Some sites, 200 feet in depth, were sold off and spanned with concrete planks. The space between opposite buildings across the trench then was covered with landscaped private gardens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hidden gardens behind one new project, at 505 W. 47th St., were credited with helping revive sales of units in the building. Mati Weiderpass, a developer of the 505, said the New York Central began selling off parcels over the tracks in 1960s, when sites were developed as hotels with parking to accommodate the 1964 World's Fair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His company is now planning to redevelop one of those older railroad sites, a Travel Inn on West 42nd Street, into what he described as a "gay urban resort" with a 10,000-square-foot dance floor and 123 guest rooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, private landscaped courtyards in Manhattan have been familiar features at many prewar buildings such as the Apthorp on West 79th Street, which was built more than a century ago on a full square block on the Upper West Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the gardens in Hell's Kitchen are a bit different. Rather than being located along a grand boulevard, the gardens are hidden away in the 40s near 10th Avenue in a mixed neighborhood of low-rise tenements, small industrial buildings and some newer apartment buildings, limited to seven stories under city zoning rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first hidden garden was built in 2006 over tracks in a condominium called Clinton West on a site between West 46th and 47th streets, west of 10th Avenue, the first development above the tracks in two decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two seven-story buildings, one facing each side street, were connected with a putting green and a greenhouse atrium. After a whirlwind marketing campaign, 149 condos sold out after eight days on the market, according to the&nbsp;project's developerator, SDS Procida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second project, the 505 building, took much longer to sell. It was built on concrete planking between West 47th and 48th streets, with seven-story buildings connected by a rear public garden featuring wood-planked walkways and a glass-walled pavilion that houses a fitness center. Ground-floor apartments have private gardens as well. There are private cabanas on the roof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project, built by Mr. Weiderpass and Ian Reisner of Parkview Developers, initialy sold quickly when it went on the market in 2007, and at one point it had 95 of the 108 units under contract. But as the real-estate market tottered during the recession, many buyers refused to close and some filed administrative complaints and lawsuits to get back their deposits back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the marketing campaign is getting a second wind. Some buyers have come back and closed at or near their original contract prices. Other buyers have stepped in to sign new contracts. So far 36 apartments have been sold and another 59 are under contract, according to Stephen G. Kliegerman of Halstead Property, which marketed the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartments at the 505 are priced at about $1,100 per square foot, or less than $600,000 for a smaller one bedroom, and more than $800,000 for larger ones. Two-bedroom apartments begin at less than $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few blocks to the north, the Griffin Court, a new condominium that just went on the market, will have a large hideaway rear garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenneth S. Horn, president of Alchemy Properties, which is developing 95 apartments on 10th Avenue and West 54th Street, said the site would include an 8,700-square-foot private courtyard with a patio on two levels, gardens, trees and play areas. There are private gardens as well, lined with fencing and bamboo trees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the neighborhood is a bit off the beaten path, buyers—many of them first-time home buyers have been drawn by lower prices on new condos. At Griffin Court, prices are a bit higher, though room sizes are typically larger. One-bedrooms start at $875,000. Two-bedrooms begin at $1.7 million, with most priced at more than $2 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-sale activity has been picking up in communities across the New York metropolitan area. However, some economists believe that prices, which declined during the fourth quarter in most areas, will continue to move lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Although affordability has been restored to a great degree, prices are still high relative to household income," said David Stiff, chief economist at Fiserv Case-Shiller, a financial-services firm based in Brookfield, Wis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We haven't returned to equilibrium yet," according to the economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stiff said the expiration of the federal tax credit for first-time home buyers, which ends Friday, also will weigh on prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We expect that prices will drop by a little bit more and will stabilize a little bit later than for the U.S. as a whole," according to Mr. Stiff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that in the New York City region, the more expensive areas will experience less dramatic price declines than less expensive markets.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property on the gritty western edges of Hell's Kitchen may never become as hot as the stretch of land abutting the High Line, the elevated former rail line in Chelsea that has become one of the city's most popular parks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a trench for subterranean railroad tracks cutting through Hell's Kitchen has given life to an unusual New York amenity: secret gardens that have helped close deals in the rough-hewn area during the city's real-estate slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tracks were built for the New York Central Railroad in the 1930s to divert freight trains from the middle of 11th Avenue, which had become so dangerous for pedestrians dodging trains that it was known as "Death Avenue."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trench runs through the neighborhood west of 10th Avenue, and while the freight traffic is gone, the rumble of Amtrak trains en route to and from Albany and points north can still be heard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the recent real-estate boom, the space above the trench was put to another use: Some sites, 200 feet in depth, were sold off and spanned with concrete planks. The space between opposite buildings across the trench then was covered with landscaped private gardens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hidden gardens behind one new project, at 505 W. 47th St., were credited with helping revive sales of units in the building.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign governments have emerged as an engine of growth as the city's real estate market struggles to shrug off the doldrums, becoming major buyers of townhouses, office condominiums and other properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sri Lanka's Permanent Mission to the United Nations is looking to spend about $6 million to purchase Manhattan office space, brokers say. Laos in February paid $4.2 million, all cash, for a five-story townhouse in Murray Hill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the Western Hemisphere's poorest country—Haiti—was gearing up to bid on a Second Avenue office condominium when the earthquake struck and derailed its plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign governments "are almost the only game in town," says Ken Krasnow, a managing director with building-sale specialist Massey Knakal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the boom, foreign governments seeking to buy real estate for consulates and U.N. missions had a hard time competing with faster-moving private developers. But since early 2009, Senegal, Singapore, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates have all bought property they plan to redevelop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, those governments are among the only buyers still willing to pay top dollar, almost always in cash, for vacant office space or land sites—especially for properties within walking distance from the U.N. complex in Turtle Bay. The trend underscores the bench strength of New York real estate: When certain buying groups move to the sidelines, others are waiting to take their place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers sometimes shy away from dealing with foreign bureaucracies, which often make decisions at a glacial pace and have special security concerns. Deals can be toppled at the last moment by elections or coups. But of late, "people are patiently waiting for them to close," Mr. Krasnow says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Case in point: It took landlord Philips International three years of negotiations until a deal with the Ivory Coast for an $8 million office condominium at 800 Second Ave. finally closed last September, according to Vice President Andrew Aberham. Total time in escrow: an eye-popping 377 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bangladesh and Afghanistan have also bought Manhattan office condos in the past year, with Afghanistan paying $5.4 million for 9,600 square feet at 633 Third Ave. Philips is now marketing a renovated office-condo building at 110 E. 40th St. to government buyers. Mr. Aberham says he also has several foreign governments looking at the last unsold floor of his office-condo building at 820 Second Ave., including Sri Lanka.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a good time to buy," says an employee at Sri Lanka's mission who declined to be identified. "The prices of property here were rather prohibitive for a long time." He says the mission was looking for about 10,000 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governments see an opportunity to pick up prestigious Manhattan real estate at a good price, brokers say. "Smaller countries do the majority of the buying because they like to feel that they own something in New York City," says Gil Robinov, who specializes in deals with foreign governments for brokerage NAI Global New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Robinov says he helped Haiti look into consolidating its U.N. mission and its New York consulate in a single space. "I was working with the ambassador," he says. "We were all set to move forward but once there was an earthquake I couldn't even get him on the phone." Haiti's U.N. ambassador didn't return a request for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On East 32nd Street, construction should start next year on a new, eight-story cultural center for South Korea, says a spokesman for the cultural center, Michael Hagen. The building will include a theater, a gallery, space for cooking classes, and a traditional South Korean guest room. The country bought the site for $16 million in March 2009, according to data firm CoStar Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dozen blocks north, on East 44th Street, Senegal bought a site on which it plans to build a home for its U.N. mission as well as cultural and business facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign of the complexity of deals with foreign governments, Senegal's acquisition of that site last year was briefly tied up in court when the seller filed a lawsuit accusing Senegal representatives of failing to fund the deal and "essentially acting like the notorious deadbeat who swears that 'the check is in the mail.'" Twelve days later, a press release announced that the deal had closed, the lawsuit was being withdrawn and the sellers apologized "for any unnecessary publicity" the suit may have caused.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenneth Fisher, a lawyer for the country, said on Wednesday that the "Maison du Senegal" project is going forward. A lawyer for the sellers of the site, Hotel E 44th St LLC and East 46th Street Development Company LLC, didn't return a request for comment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pension funds that were battered by big losses in real-estate private-equity investments made before the bust are reopening the funding spigot to similar transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Institutional investors have made some of their biggest recent bets in less-risky real-estate funds that avoid heavy leverage and invest in less-risky properties. But some pension funds, hoping to take advantage of an economic recovery, also plan to invest billions of dollars in the kinds of more highly leveraged opportunity funds that suffered some of the largest losses of the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pension funds and other large institutions will pour $34 billion into real estate in 2010, nearly double the 2009 amount, a survey by consultants Institutional Real Estate Inc. and Kingsley Associates projects. Of that $34 billion, about one-third will go toward safer investments in commercial real estate. Roughly $8 billion would invest in debt, overseas deals and other kinds of real-estate transactions. Another $13 billion would go to riskier private-equity deals such as land and distressed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These plans have reignited fierce competition to control billions of dollars in real-estate investments in the wake of the industry's worst downturn in two decades. Though many argue falling prices have created buying opportunities, some say many investors are forgetting about the pain just suffered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jay Leupp, portfolio manager of real-estate stocks for property firm <span class="companylink">Grubb &amp;Ellis</span>, said pension funds largely stay with private-equity firms because they have invested that way for decades. "Change does take some effort and may involve some risk," he said. "It's easy to do the same kind of investing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pension-fund forays into real-estate are picking up. Earlier this year, the Ohio public-employee pension fund voted to invest $300 million each in two real-estate funds run by <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co</span>. and UBS AG. On Wednesday, the council charged with investing Oregon's $52 billion public-employee pension fund is expected to consider an investment in a real-estate private-equity fund managed by <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span>, according to the meeting agenda. Similarly, the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System plans to invest $1 billion in real estate over the next five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate funds take money from pension funds and other big investors and use it to buy property, returning cash to investors when buildings are sold. They are considered riskier but potentially more rewarding investments than REITs and are aimed at more sophisticated clientele. REITs, on the other hand, are public companies that own buildings and pass rental income to shareholders in the form of dividends. REIT proponents say they are a safer bet than going the private-equity route again. "Real-estate private equity is coming out of an era that should discredit the entire strategy," said Brad Case, chief economist for the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But institutional investors only plan to channel 3.5% of their real-estate investments into REITs in 2010, according to the Institutional Real Estate survey. Proponents of private real-estate investing argue pension plans can benefit more from the downturn by buying into property funds. REITs, they say, have already recovered, having risen some 140% from their lows in March 2009. The stocks are still about 40% below their February 2007 peak. Around the market peak, real-estate private-equity funds became some of the property market's biggest buyers, and pension funds provided much of the capital that fed their highly leveraged deals and drove the market up. The bust left pension funds some of the biggest losers. The real-estate portfolio of the <span class="companylink">California Public Employees' Retirement System</span>, for example, lost nearly half its value in the 12 months ending last June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even private-equity funds that were billed to be safer suffered severe pain. These funds did little borrowing, invested in fully leased properties and were "open-ended," meaning they allowed investors to request to take their money out at any time. Nevertheless, these funds lost 30% of their value in 2009, according to the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries' NFI-ODCE index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, when the downturn hit, many of these open-ended funds found themselves unable to meet investor demands to get their money back, creating backlogs of investors waiting for checks. <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>'s $15 billion Strategic Property Fund, for example, had a backlog, also known as a "redemption queue," of $2.4 billion in March 2009. But as pension funds begin reinvesting in private-equity funds, those queues are vanishing. The queue at the <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> fund, for example, is now gone. Pension-fund executives say they are rebalancing portfolios to make sure they have enough money allocated to real estate. "There are some real opportunities in the market as long as you pick the right strategies and the right [general partners]," said Katherine Durant, who heads the Oregon state pension fund's investment council.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Esther Fung  </div><div>1043 words</div><div>27 April 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Europe Edition)</div><div>WSJE</div><div>11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI -- China is considering introducing new or higher taxes on real estate, possibly even a U.S.-style property tax, which would mark a significant escalation of its struggle to cool down a booming property market now widely being described as a bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How authorities handle any kind of property tax -- the prospect of which is fiercely opposed by some property developers -- will have significant implications for China's economy, and will ripple through global markets. The construction boom is the main driver of the current recovery in China, and is one of the few parts of the world economy growing strongly right now. Construction also underpins China's demand for raw materials, which has helped to support global prices for commodities, such as copper and iron ore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, many prominent local economists have urged authorities in Beijing to make more use of the powerful tool of taxation to curb property speculation and rein in runaway prices. China now levies several types of taxes on property sales, but authorities are said to be considering higher transaction taxes that target luxury properties, or possibly a tax on property values similar to the kind levied by local governments in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reasoning is that higher taxes will make it less attractive to invest in real estate. And giving local governments more revenue from property taxes could reduce their incentive to keep prices high to profit from sales of land-use rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opponents fear new taxes would shatter confidence in the real-estate market, leading to a bust that would damage the entire economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a notice last week announcing a package of policies to contain rapidly rising housing prices, China's State Council told tax authorities to speed up the drafting of tax policies that will "guide appropriate purchases of housing and regulate personal gains from property." The government has given few details publicly, and local media have in recent days been filled with conflicting reports about the different types of taxes that could be introduced in various areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The details of the tax are very sketchy right now, but there is a sense of urgency from the government to ease prices, not just for economic reasons, but also for social reasons. The rich-poor disparity is troubling," said Wu Jianxiong, an analyst from Central China Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average urban-property prices in China rose an average of 11.7% in March, the fastest pace since the Chinese government began releasing the data in July 2005. Prices in major cities such as Shanghai and Beijing are increasingly making property unaffordable for large portions of the population, and have become a focus of public discontent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's government has promoted widespread homeownership and has repeatedly said it will continue to support first-time home buyers even as it rolls out restrictive policies aimed at investors and speculators. So analysts expect any new tax policies to be imposed on high-end residences, or target individuals who have bought multiple properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, China levies several forms of one-off taxes related to a property transaction, such as a stamp duty, an income tax and a transaction tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though many options are being discussed, many analysts and market observers think the government could impose what is being labeled as a "property consumption" tax on luxury property in select cities -- a term that could be interpreted as a tax on anything beyond a primary residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more radical change would be to start levying an annual tax based on the value of people's homes -- the kind of property tax that a homeowner in the average U.S. suburb would be familiar with. This has been advocated by Chinese economists who say local governments need a more secure revenue source.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The main purpose of such a tax would be to dampen speculative demand and to increase the costs of holding property for wealthy people," said Hingyin Lee, director of research and advisory from Colliers International.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese media have reported that such a tax may be implemented in Chongqing, a vast city in southwestern China that has been a focal point of experiments in urban governance. In an interview with a newspaper backed by the official Xinhua news agency, Chongqing's mayor, Huang Qifan, said the city had proposed to the national government a plan for a Western-style property tax for high-end properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chongqing has proposed an annual tax equivalent to 1% of the value of any home over 200 square meters that has sold for three times the average market price, Mr. Huang said in the interview. The tax would rise to 1.5% if a home sells for four times the average price, and would continue rising on a progressive scale up to 5% of the full house price. The interview didn't specify how the average price would be estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Chongqing city spokesman, Wen Tianping, confirmed the details of the plan and said it had been submitted to the State Council for approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a potential sign of the sensitivity of the planned tax, on Friday the interview was no longer available on the newspaper's Web site. The Chongqing city spokesman said he didn't know why the report had been taken down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China now collects 1.2% annual tax on 70% to 90% of the value of commercial property, and analysts say another possibility would be to extend the commercial-property tax to third and subsequent homes by classifying such properties as income-generating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said it is hard to predict how much further sales volumes and prices would fall under any new property-tax policy, given the lack of details over the tax policies, and that adjustments may have to be made to current transaction costs to avoid duplication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sales of high-end residential homes will definitely be hit," said Johnson Hu, an analyst from UOB Kayhian. "Transaction volumes have already dipped this week as home-buyers take a wait-and-see approach."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pension funds that were battered by big losses in real-estate private-equity investments made before the bust are reopening the funding spigot to similar transactions.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as optimism grows about the strength of the recovery, one big question looms: To what extent is the economy running on government life support?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next several months, the housing market will offer a clue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing has been a major beneficiary of the government's stimulus efforts. Tax credits for homebuyers, the Federal Reserve's unprecedented efforts to hold down mortgage rates, and loan modifications aimed at preventing foreclosures have helped housing show signs of life, albeit not as much as many economists had hoped. Home prices have stabilized, while sales and construction are up from their recession lows but still well below long-term averages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the government is pulling the plug. The tax credits expire on Friday, the Fed has already stopped buying mortgage bonds and the pace of new trial modifications under the Treasury's Home Affordable Modification Program has begun to slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether or not the housing market can stand on its own will provide valuable insight into the broader recovery's ability to keep going when the Obama administration's stimulus package peters out around the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's the nagging question right now," says Yale University economist Robert Shiller. "How much of the strength in the housing market is just the perception of government support?" he said. "I do have concern about a double dip."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To some extent, a weak housing market can actually be a sign of health. The U.S. economy needs to reduce permanently its dependence on credit-fueled construction, and move more toward selling goods and services to booming emerging markets. At the peak of the housing boom, construction and other housing-related services accounted for about 6.3% of the U.S. economy. Now they account for only 2.5%. The right level is probably somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less dependence on housing and U.S. consumers "will mean a better balance and a healthier recovery," says Joseph Carson, director of global economic research at AllianceBernstein in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, if house prices were to head down again in the absence of government support, it could be a problem for the recovery. The recent stabilization of prices, which according to the S&amp;P Case-Shiller Index were down just 0.7% in January from a year earlier, has done a lot to support fragile confidence among consumers and in financial markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices also underpin the value of the $2.6 trillion in mortgages on banks' balance sheets. If a new decline caused banks to fret about their own finances, that could make it tougher for businesses -- particularly the small ones that account for an outsized share of new jobs -- to get the credit they need to expand. And without new jobs, the rise in consumer spending would be hard to sustain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists see various reasons to worry home prices could drop again. For one, the rising number of foreclosed homes will weigh on an already weak market -- a delayed result of the same mortgage defaults that are, in some cases, allowing consumers to free up more of their income for spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of March, banks and investment trusts had an inventory of about 1.1 million foreclosed homes, up 20% from a year earlier, according to estimates from LPS Applied Analytics. Another 4.8 million mortgage holders were at least 60 days behind on their payments or in the foreclosure process, meaning their homes were well on their way to the inventory pile. That "shadow inventory" was up 30% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks have so far been slow to dump homes on the market: At the current rate of sales, it would take almost nine years to work through both the real and "shadow" inventory. "They're just squeaking them out," says Loren Gonella, owner of Coldwell Banker Gonella Realty in Merced, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At some point, banks will have to sell all those houses. Meanwhile, foreclosures could accelerate as loan modifications slow and an increasing number of those who received relief go back into default. New government initiatives are also encouraging mortgage servicers and lenders to agree to so-called short sales, in which the borrower sells the house for less than the mortgage debt and the bank forgives the difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that will add to the supply of distressed homes on the market, even as the government programs supporting demand come to an end. Ed McKelvey, an economist at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> in New York, estimates that the combined effect will depress prices about 5%. That's on top of whatever the market would have done on its own -- an underlying trend that could as easily be down as up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have a market that's got more supply than demand, and we know what happens to prices in those kinds of markets," says Mr. McKelvey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new leg down in house prices could benefit some, such as first-time home buyers who have long been priced out of the market. On average, homes are already more affordable than they've been in decades -- though prices still look high by historical standards in many parts of the country, including New York City.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty   </div><div>1160 words</div><div>26 April 2010</div><div>11:31</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax credits sparked a big jump in home sales last month, as first-time buyers took advantage of low prices and interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the longer-term housing outlook remains clouded, with a large inventory of foreclosed homes expected to hit the market later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal's latest quarterly survey of housing-market conditions in 28 major metro areas found that inventories of homes for sale, as well as the number of distressed borrowers, remain very high in many metro areas. That portends more downward pressure on prices from bank foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though tax credits are providing a temporary boost, "we're still in a very fragile housing market," said Ivy Zelman, chief executive of Zelman &amp; Associates, a research firm, who doesn't expect a full recovery before 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes and condominiums hit a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.35 million in March, the National Association of Realtors reported Thursday. That compares with a 5.01 million rate in February and was up 16% from the depressed March 2009 rate of 4.61 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Journal survey found that Miami, Orlando and Tampa, Fla., Las Vegas, Phoenix and Atlanta have some of the highest concentrations of distressed borrowers at risk of losing their homes. Nearly 28% of homeowners with mortgages are at least 30 days late on payments in the Miami area, more than double the national average of 12.2%, according to LPS Applied Analytics. That rate stands at about 24% in Orlando and Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes already on the market is well above the national average in Charlotte, N.C., Jacksonville, Fla., Nashville, Tenn., Chicago and Philadelphia. In Charlotte, where bank cutbacks have increased unemployment, there are enough homes on the market to last 17 months at the average sales pace of the past year. That compares with 15 months in Jacksonville, 13 in the Long Island suburbs of New York and 11 in the New Jersey suburbs. A market generally is considered balanced when the supply is around six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among metro areas with relatively low rates of delinquent borrowers and for-sale inventories: Boston, Denver, Dallas, Houston, Minneapolis, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for home resales in March was $170,700, up 0.4% from a year earlier, the Realtors reported. A price index produced by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> in February was down 3.4% from a year earlier, the agency said. Realtors say prices for middle-class homes in the types of neighborhoods that attract investors and first-time buyers are flat or rising slightly, while higher-end home prices generally continue to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, real estate agents have a compelling pitch: Prices have fallen an average of about 30% across the country since peaking in 2006; mortgage rates are near their lowest levels in four decades; and many people who sign a contract to buy a home by April 30 can qualify for federal tax credits worth up to $8,000. "Now is the time to do something," said Bill Wilkerson, an agent at ZipRealty in Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Mr. Wilkerson's customers, Rebecca Ahlschwede, last week offered about $200,000 for a three-bedroom foreclosed home with a pool in Scottsdale, Ariz. Ms. Ahlschwede, a 31-year-old neurology technician who currently rents, said the $8,000 tax credit she hopes to receive would be "a huge bonus."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit appears to be giving more of a boost to previously occupied homes than to new construction, as first-time buyers favor the short commutes of older neighborhoods. Ms. Zelman said the rise in sales of new homes appeared more moderate than many builders had hoped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rush to qualify for the credit will end after the April 30 deadline for signed contracts, though the resulting boost to completed home sales will continue to help monthly reports through June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those tax credits likely pulled forward sales that otherwise would have occurred later in the year. Partly as a result, "I think we're going to have a pretty soft second half" of 2010 for housing sales, said John Burns, a real estate consultant in Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank efforts to work out lower loan payments for some borrowers have delayed millions of foreclosures, but those who don't qualify are now increasingly losing their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com predicts that 1.9 million homes will be lost to foreclosures or related defaults this year and another 1.1 million in 2011. That compares with two million last year and 600,000 in normal times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unemployment remains high and is unlikely to improve much soon, some economists say. Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com, expects the unemployment rate to be 10.2% at year's end, up from 9.7% in March. At the end of 2011, he sees a still hefty 8.6% rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit conditions, already tight, will get tighter in at least one respect. Around a third of home sales in recent months have been financed by loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration, which allows down payments as low as 3.5%. But now, the FHA is tightening its terms somewhat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By early summer, the FHA plans to reduce the maximum amount a seller can contribute to the buyer's closing costs—such as loan-origination, legal and appraisal fees—to 3% of the home price from 6%. That means buyers will have to save more to meet closing costs. Mr. Burns said a survey of builders by his firm found they expected the FHA change to eliminate as many as 15% of potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists expect rates on standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgages to rise at least moderately from the recent level of 5% to 5.25%. Mr. Zandi expects a rate of about 5.7% by year's end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite these worries, Jacelyn Botti, who heads residential sales for seven mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states for <span class="companylink">Weichert Realtors</span>, said that home-sales contracts signed by the firm's customers in March were up about 26% from a year earlier in that area, and April was on track for another gain of more than 20%. She said the tax credit and lower prices were driving buyers. Prices on lower-end homes are trending up in some areas, Ms. Botti said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newland Communities, a San Diego-based company that plans and develops communities in 14 states, says 761 homes sold in those communities in the first quarter, up 28% from a year earlier. Robert McLeod, chief executive officer of Newland, said Austin, Houston and San Diego were among the stronger markets for the company. He thinks recovering consumer confidence is helping sales. "It's all about job growth," Mr. McLeod said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Esther Fung   </div><div>1036 words</div><div>25 April 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI—China is considering introducing new or higher taxes on real estate, possibly even a U.S.-style property tax, which would mark a significant escalation of its struggle to cool down a booming property market now widely being described as a bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How authorities handle any kind of property tax—the prospect of which is fiercely opposed by some property developers—will have significant implications for China's economy, and will ripple through global markets. The construction boom is the main driver of the current recovery in China, and is one of the few parts of the world economy growing strongly right now. Construction also underpins China's demand for raw materials, which has helped support global prices for commodities, such as copper and iron ore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, many prominent local economists have urged authorities in Beijing to make more use of the powerful tool of taxation to curb property speculation and rein in runaway prices. China now levies several types of taxes on property sales, but authorities are said to be considering higher transaction taxes that target luxury properties, or possibly a tax on property values similar to the kind levied by local governments in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reasoning is that higher taxes will make it less attractive to invest in real estate. And giving local governments more revenue from property taxes could reduce their incentive to keep prices high to profit from sales of land-use rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opponents fear new taxes would shatter confidence in the real-estate market, leading to a bust that would damage the entire economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a notice last week announcing a package of policies to contain rapidly rising housing prices, China's State Council told tax authorities to speed up the drafting of tax policies that will "guide appropriate purchases of housing and regulate personal gains from property." The government has given few details publicly, and local media have in recent days been filled with conflicting reports about the different types of taxes that could be introduced in various areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The details of the tax are very sketchy right now, but there is a sense of urgency from the government to ease prices, not just for economic reasons, but also for social reasons. The rich-poor disparity is troubling," said Wu Jianxiong, an analyst from Central China Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average urban-property prices in China rose an average of 11.7% in March, the fastest pace since the Chinese government began releasing the data in July 2005. Prices in major cities such as Shanghai and Beijing are increasingly making property unaffordable for large portions of the population, and have become a focus of public discontent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's government has promoted widespread home-ownership and has repeatedly said it will continue to support first-time home buyers even as it rolls out restrictive policies aimed at investors and speculators. So analysts expect any new tax policies to be imposed on high-end residences, or target individuals who have bought multiple properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, China levies several forms of one-off taxes related to a property transaction, such as a stamp duty, an income tax and a transaction tax. Though many options are being discussed, many analysts and market observers think the government could impose what is being labeled as a "property consumption" tax on luxury property in select cities—a term that could be interpreted as a tax on anything beyond a primary residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more radical change would be to start levying an annual tax based on the value of people's homes—the kind of property tax that a homeowner in the average U.S. suburb would be familiar with. This has been advocated by Chinese economists who say local governments need a more secure revenue source.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The main purpose of such a tax would be to dampen speculative demand and to increase the costs of holding property for wealthy people," said Hingyin Lee, director of research and advisory from Colliers International.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese media have reported that such a tax may be implemented in Chongqing, a vast city in southwestern China that has been a focal point of experiments in urban governance. In an interview with a newspaper backed by the official Xinhua news agency, Chongqing's mayor, Huang Qifan, said the city had proposed to the national government a plan for a Western-style property tax for high-end properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chongqing has proposed an annual tax equivalent to 1% of the value of any home over 200 square meters that has sold for three times the average market price, Mr. Huang said in the interview. The tax would rise to 1.5% if a home sells for four times the average price, and would continue rising on a progressive scale up to 5% of the full house price. The interview didn't specify how the average price would be estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Chongqing city spokesman, Wen Tianping, confirmed the details of the plan and said it had been submitted to the State Council for approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a potential sign of the sensitivity of the planned tax, on Friday the interview was no longer available on the newspaper's Web site. The Chongqing city spokesman said he didn't know why the the report had been taken down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China now collects 1.2% annual tax on 70% to 90% of the value of commercial property, and analysts say another possibility would be to extend the commercial-property tax to third and subsequent homes by classifying such properties as income-generating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said it is hard to predict how much further sales volumes and prices would fall under any new property-tax policy, given the lack of details over the tax policies, and that adjustments may have to be made to current transaction costs to avoid duplication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sales of high-end residential homes will definitely be hit," said Johnson Hu, an analyst from UOB Kayhian. "Transaction volumes have already dipped this week as home-buyers take a wait-and-see approach."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales jumped in March as buyers rushed to qualify for a federal tax credit and realtors homed in on the soon-to-expire credit as a way to ramp up interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new single-family houses jumped 27% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 411,000, according to the Census Bureau. That was up from the revised pace of 324,000 for February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Census estimate is based on a small sample and is frequently subject to large revisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists believe the latest report may overstate the increase in sales activity and that the credit is simply moving sales forward that otherwise would have occurred later in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some home builders say foot traffic at developments has picked up in recent weeks, spurred by buyers hoping to qualify for a federal tax credit. The credit is available to many people who sign a contract to buy a principal residence by April 30 and complete the purchase by June 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The tax credit has been a huge boon to the industry," said Tim Minton, executive vice president of the Home Builders Association of Raleigh-Wake County in North Carolina. He said inventories of unsold homes in his area have dwindled, and "the national builders are starting to ramp up new production."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stock prices of home builders surged on the news, with <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>. adding 8.7% to close at $7.15; sector-giant <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>. climbed 5.7% to end at $13.19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gains continue what has been a good year for the group: The Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction index is up almost 30% year to date, with a 3.6% gain Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit can be as much as $8,000 for first-time home buyers and as much as $6,500 for people who already have owned a home for at least five consecutive years during the previous eight years. The credit is available for individual taxpayers with annual incomes of as much as $145,000 or joint filers with incomes as much as $245,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sellers are doing their best to whip up a sense of urgency. Outside the Century 21 Frontier Realty office in McMurray, Pa., a sign reads: "Tax Credit Expiring April 30. Hurry!" In what it calls Moonlight Madness, national builder <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> plans to keep its sales offices open until 9 p.m. rather than the usual 7 p.m. this weekend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Crowe, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders, a trade group, said the credit has been much more effective for first-time buyers than for repeat buyers, who often are saddled with homes that must be sold before another purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reported annual pace of March sales is less than a third of the peak of nearly 1.3 million in 2005 during the housing frenzy. "By historical standards, March's numbers were abysmal," said Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight, "but they were much higher than February's."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and other economists warn that the tax credit probably pulled forward sales that otherwise would have occurred later in the year. As a result, they say, the sales rate may drop at least temporarily after the April 30 tax-credit deadline. "We certainly have moved some sales from the future into the present," said Mr. Crowe of the home builders group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Sivage, owner of Sivage Homes, which builds homes in the San Antonio area and parts of New Mexico, said his first-quarter sales doubled from a year earlier to 120, largely because of the tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Sivage remains cautious. "Most of the builders I talk to around the country are still very concerned that the market has not turned the corner" and fear that sales will retreat after the tax deadline, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Irvine Co</span>., a builder in Orange County, Calif., is more bullish. "The buyer is seeing the bottom, agreeing that we've hit the bottom," said Dan Young, president of community development at Irvine. "The new-home market is back."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders and real-estate brokers hope that an improving economy will soon start generating more jobs, bringing more home buyers into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't see everything [in terms of sales] falling off the cliff after the tax credit expires," said Jeff Bernard, chief executive of Bernard Real Estate Analytics, a research firm in Denver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fear of unemployment also remains an obstacle. "If you feel that your job is at risk, you're not going to go out and buy another home," says Mark Vitner, senior economist at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Securities</span>. He predicts only a "gradual recovery in home sales and new home construction over the next several years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Burns, a real-estate consultant in Irvine, Calif., said an improving economy and strong demand from investors for foreclosed homes should help stabilize prices, despite continuing waves of bank-owned homes washing onto the market. "The high end of the market still has a long way to fall," Mr. Burns said, "but the low end is pretty stable and even appreciating in some places."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Juliet Chung   </div><div>922 words</div><div>23 April 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bedford, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently,Michael Steinhardt asked his wife and weight-management overseer Judy if he could have an oatmeal cookie. "Suffer!" she cried, chuckling. Sulking, Mr. Steinhardt slumped into a nearby armchair and buried himself in a nursery catalogue entitled "Arrowhead Alpines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a long way from Mr. Steinhardt's days on Wall Street. Known for his intense competitiveness and outsized temper, Mr. Steinhardt spent 29 years running a hedge fund that grew to $4.4 billion while racking up annual returns of 30% before fees. But since shuttering his fund in 1995, Mr. Steinhardt, age 69, has been pouring his energies and resources into his 51-acre Bedford estate, where he has been continually updating his collection of plants and animals from around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to his work keeping tabs on a zoo-sized collection of animals including zebras, camels and albino wallabies, Mr. Steinhardt spends hours immersed in dense nursery catalogs, picking plantings the way he once picked investments. "He's still pretty competitive," says neighbor and frequent visitor Martha Stewart, who first met Mr. Steinhardt in the early '70s when she worked as a stockbroker. Her warning to hopefuls at rare-plant auctions: "Don't expect to buy much if Michael Steinhardt is there. He buys everything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though he and his wife collect art and own homes in Jerusalem, Anguilla and Manhattan, Mr. Steinhardt said the Bedford estate is the material possession he values most. "Each year I wonder whether we're going to have new ways to absolutely lavish absurd amounts of money on this place; somehow we manage to do it," he said. While he declined to say exactly how much, Mr. Steinhardt said the property is his single biggest expense after his philanthropic work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Steinhardt's reservoir-adjacent property is made up of acres dedicated to a continually evolving mosaic of gardens, orchards and paddocks where, in warm weather, animals roam. There's an acre-sized aviary with a brook that houses some 76 types of waterfowl and a large glass greenhouse sheltering citrus trees along with African ducks and a squeaking entourage of squirrel monkeys. In recent years, Mr. Steinhardt and his wife have begun building a conifer garden and a hill of oaks and have expanded their Japanese maple garden to eight acres. Also in the works: a stone fruit orchard on a 13-acre parcel of land across the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent Friday, a cold snap threatened the first daffodils. Mr. Steinhardt, mustachioed and clad in a grey parka and fleece hat, trudged around the property and pointed out the first signs of spring: creamy pink magnolia buds, blooming viburnum and baby albino wallabies poking out from their mothers' pouches. He pointed out the barns his wife had built for the animals and showed off a pair of red-ruffed lemurs, the most recent additions to his menagerie of roughly 200 (excluding waterfowl). Mr. Steinhardt mimicked the low honk of a capybara, a large rodent from Central and South America, wandering nearby and said, "And that's what he has to say!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raised in an immigrant neighborhood in Brooklyn, Mr. Steinhardt lived in his grandparents' apartment with his mother, a bookkeeper for a wholesale fruit business. He got his start in the market at the age of 13 when his father, a jeweler and frequent gambler, gave him shares of Penn Dixie Cement and <span class="companylink">Columbia Gas System</span> for his bar mitzvah. Mr. Steinhardt eventually went on to become one of the stars of the hedge-fund industry, though in the 1990s he paid $40 million in a settlement with the SEC and the Justice department over allegations that his funds were involved in the Salomon Brothers Treasury bond-auction scandal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After renting homes in the area, the couple purchased 16 acres in Bedford in 1978 and purchased the remaining acreage over the years, spending around $4 million in all. Six employees take care of the animals, and the Steinhardts use an outside company to take care of the gardens. Estate manager Jason Hayes estimates the animals go through 120,000 pounds of feed a year. Asked the cost of such maintenance, "that's probably a number [Mr. Steinhardt] doesn't want to add up to find out," Mr. Hayes responded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Steinhardt's country home is a 10,000-square-foot, Adirondack-style home of stone and cedar with four bedrooms, a double-height great room, a caretaker's apartment and a 14-seat screening room paneled in synethetic horsehair. Jars of jam from fruit grown on the grounds line the kitchen counters and bright, feathered Peruvian textiles hang on walls. Since the 2007 peak, property values in Bedford are off 20 to 30%, estimates Dan Ginnel of Ginnel Real Estate, but he says deal-making has quickened in the last several months. Recently, a 26-acre estate down the road from the Steinhardts' that was listed for more than $15 million several years ago sold for $9.4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Steinhardt leaned in toward a barn stall, a white llama named Angel poked his head out curiously. "Hello! Hello! How do you do?" Mr. Steinhardt cooed softly as Angel snuffled against his face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"'Here sweetie, here sweetie,' is when he's talking to Angel the llama, not to me," said Judy wryly.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales climbed in March as first-time home buyers rushed to take advantage of a government tax credit ahead of the program's expiration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits decreased last week, but the levels still aren't low enough to be consistent with an improving job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. wholesale inflation rose by more than expected last month as food prices moved sharply higher, but the core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items barely increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes were up slightly more than expected, climbing 6.8%, to a 5.35 million annual rate from a downwardly revised 5.01 million annual rate in February, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Analysts surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected sales to rise to an annual rate of 5.25 million. Sales were up 16% from March 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of distressed properties, such as foreclosures, accounted for 35% of March sales, the Realtors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors' group, credited the government's tax-credit program with driving sales higher, but he said it would take months for the full effects of the program to be reflected in the data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the Realtors' group didn't plan to push for another extension of the program, saying the housing-market recovery had reached a point where that wouldn't be necessary. The tax credits were originally set to expire in November but were expanded and extended to apply to contracts signed through the end of April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time home buyers purchased 44% of all homes in March, up from 42% in February, the Realtors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing inventory in March rose 1.5% to 3.58 million, representing an eight-month supply. That's down from an 8.5 month supply in February, the Realtors' group said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group said the median price for existing homes rose 0.4% to $170,700. Prices were up across most of the U.S., except in the West, where median prices slipped 7.9% to $209,400.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Labor Department said in its weekly report Thursday that initial claims for jobless benefits fell by 24,000 to 456,000 in the week ended April 17. The drop was right in line with the expectations of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The previous week's level was revised downward to 480,000 from 484,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in jobless claims comes after two weeks of unexpected surges in the figures, which the U.S. Labor Department blamed on the Easter holiday and other seasonal factors. The department had said rising layoffs weren't likely to blame for the increases, but nevertheless the elevated numbers raised concern among outside experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week moving average, which aims to smooth volatility in the data to help paint a better picture of the underlying trend, rose for the week ended April 17. The Labor Department said the four-week moving average went up by 2,750 to 460,250 from the previous week's revised average of 457,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total claims lasting more than one week, meanwhile, fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jobless claims continue to remain stubbornly high even though the U.S. economy is growing and the Labor Department's March report showed jobs were being created.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That report found nonfarm payrolls rose by 162,000, although some of the gains came from temporary hiring for the 2010 Census. Overall, unemployment still remains at 9.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have generally agreed that it will still take time to see an improved labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other news Thursday, the producer price index for finished goods rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.7% on the month in March, the Labor Department said, after falling by 0.6% in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Core wholesale prices, however, barely moved. Excluding volatile energy and food prices, producer prices rose by just 0.1% last month, the same increase seen in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires had expected wholesale prices to rise 0.4% in March. Core producer prices were seen up 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To aid an economy that is still recovering from a severe recession, the Federal Reserve has kept short-term interest rates near zero for more than a year, pointing to low inflation and high unemployment as the main factors behind its strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation has been slowing recently, particularly the price readings that strip out volatile food and energy items that are closely watched by the Fed. In March, core consumer prices moderated to an annual 1.1%, the lowest level since 1966.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose in March as the percentage of first-time home buyers continued to climb ahead of the expiration of a government tax-credit program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits decreased last week, but the levels still aren't low enough to be consistent with an improving job market. Meanwhile, U.S. wholesale inflation rose by more than expected last month as food prices moved sharply higher, but the core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items barely increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales were up slightly more than expected, climbing 6.8%, to a 5.35 million annual rate from a downwardly revised 5.01 million annual rate in February, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Analysts surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected sales to rise to an annual rate of 5.25 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing inventory in March rose 1.5% to 3.58 million, representing an 8.0 month supply. That's down from an 8.5 month supply in February, the Realtors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First time home buyers purchased 44% of all homes in March, up from 42% in February. The level of all cash sales was steady at 27%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun credited the government's tax credit program with driving sales higher, but said it would take months for the full effects of the program to be reflected in the data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said in its weekly report Thursday that initial claims for jobless benefits fell by 24,000 to 456,000 in the week ended April 17. The drop was right in line with the expectations of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The previous week's level was revised downward to 480,000 from 484,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in jobless claims comes after two prior weeks of unexpected surges in the figures which the U.S. Labor Department blamed on the Easter holiday and other seasonal factors. The department had said rising layoffs weren't likely to blame for the increases, but nevertheless the elevated numbers still raised some concerns among outside experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week moving average, which aims to smooth volatility in the data to help paint a better picture of the underlying trend, rose for the week ended April 17. The Labor Department said the four-week moving average went up by 2,750 to 460,250 from the previous week's revised average of 457,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total claims lasting more than one week, meanwhile, fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jobless claims continue to remain stubbornly high even though the U.S. economy is growing and the Labor Department's March report showed jobs were being created.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have generally agreed that it will still take time to see an improved labor market. That view was reiterated again on Monday by Federal Reserve Governor Elizabeth Duke, who said it will take "sustained, robust job growth for some time" to help repair the damage from the eight million jobs that were lost in the past three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Labor Department's Thursday report, the number of continuing claims -- those drawn by workers for more than one week in the week ended April 10 -- declined by 40,000 to 4,646,000 from the preceding week's revised level of 4,686,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unemployment rate for workers with unemployment insurance for the week ended April 10 was 3.6%, a 0.1 percentage point decline from the prior week's revised rate of 3.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The producer-price index for finished goods rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.7% on the month in March, the Labor Department said Thursday, after falling by 0.6% in February.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Juliet Chung </div><div>923 words</div><div>23 April 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>W8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bedford, N.Y. -- Recently, Michael Steinhardt asked his wife and weight-management overseer Judy if he could have an oatmeal cookie. "Suffer!" she cried, chuckling. Sulking, Mr. Steinhardt slumped into a nearby armchair and buried himself in a nursery catalogue entitled "Arrowhead Alpines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a long way from Mr. Steinhardt's days on Wall Street. Known for his intense competitiveness and outsized temper, Mr. Steinhardt spent 29 years running a hedge fund that grew to $4.4 billion while racking up annual returns of 30% before fees. But since shuttering his fund in 1995, Mr. Steinhardt, age 69, has been pouring his energies and resources into his 51-acre Bedford estate, where he has been continually updating his collection of plants and animals from around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to his work keeping tabs on a zoo-sized collection of animals including zebras, camels and albino wallabies, Mr. Steinhardt spends hours immersed in dense nursery catalogs, picking plantings the way he once picked investments. "He's still pretty competitive," says neighbor and frequent visitor Martha Stewart, who first met Mr. Steinhardt in the early '70s when she worked as a stockbroker. Her warning to hopefuls at rare-plant auctions: "Don't expect to buy much if Michael Steinhardt is there. He buys everything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though he and his wife collect art and own homes in Jerusalem, Anguilla and Manhattan, Mr. Steinhardt said the Bedford estate is the material possession he values most. "Each year I wonder whether we're going to have new ways to absolutely lavish absurd amounts of money on this place; somehow we manage to do it," he said. While he declined to say exactly how much, Mr. Steinhardt said the property is his single biggest expense after his philanthropic work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Steinhardt's reservoir-adjacent property is made up of acres dedicated to a continually evolving mosaic of gardens, orchards and paddocks where, in warm weather, animals roam. There's an acre-sized aviary with a brook that houses some 76 types of waterfowl and a large glass greenhouse sheltering citrus trees along with African ducks and a squeaking entourage of squirrel monkeys. In recent years, Mr. Steinhardt and his wife have begun building a conifer garden and a hill of oaks and have expanded their Japanese maple garden to eight acres. Also in the works: a stone fruit orchard on a 13-acre parcel of land across the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent Friday, a cold snap threatened the first daffodils. Mr. Steinhardt, mustachioed and clad in a grey parka and fleece hat, trudged around the property and pointed out the first signs of spring: creamy pink magnolia buds, blooming viburnum and baby albino wallabies poking out from their mothers' pouches. He pointed out the barns his wife had built for the animals and showed off a pair of red-ruffed lemurs, the most recent additions to his menagerie of roughly 200 (excluding waterfowl). Mr. Steinhardt mimicked the low honk of a capybara, a large rodent from Central and South America, wandering nearby and said, "And that's what he has to say!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raised in an immigrant neighborhood in Brooklyn, Mr. Steinhardt lived in his grandparents' apartment with his mother, a bookkeeper for a wholesale fruit business. He got his start in the market at the age of 13 when his father, a jeweler and frequent gambler, gave him shares of Penn Dixie Cement and <span class="companylink">Columbia Gas System</span> for his bar mitzvah. Mr. Steinhardt eventually went on to become one of the stars of the hedge-fund industry, though in the 1990s he paid $40 million in a settlement with the SEC and the Justice department over allegations that his funds were involved in the Salomon Brothers Treasury bond-auction scandal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After renting homes in the area, the couple purchased 16 acres in Bedford in 1978 and purchased the remaining acreage over the years, spending around $4 million in all. Six employees take care of the animals, and the Steinhardts use an outside company to take care of the gardens. Estate manager Jason Hayes estimates the animals go through 120,000 pounds of feed a year. Asked the cost of such maintenance, "that's probably a number [Mr. Steinhardt] doesn't want to add up to find out," Mr. Hayes responded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Steinhardt's country home is a 10,000-square-foot, Adirondack-style home of stone and cedar with four bedrooms, a double-height great room, a caretaker's apartment and a 14-seat screening room paneled in synethetic horsehair. Jars of jam from fruit grown on the grounds line the kitchen counters and bright, feathered Peruvian textiles hang on walls. Since the 2007 peak, property values in Bedford are off 20 to 30%, estimates Dan Ginnel of Ginnel Real Estate, but he says deal-making has quickened in the last several months. Recently, a 26-acre estate down the road from the Steinhardts' that was listed for more than $15 million several years ago sold for $9.4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Steinhardt leaned in toward a barn stall, a white llama named Angel poked his head out curiously. "Hello! Hello! How do you do?" Mr. Steinhardt cooed softly as Angel snuffled against his face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"'Here sweetie, here sweetie,' is when he's talking to Angel the llama, not to me," said Judy wryly.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>1143 words</div><div>23 April 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax credits sparked a big jump in home sales last month, as first-time buyers took advantage of low prices and interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the longer-term housing outlook remains clouded, with a large inventory of foreclosed homes expected to hit the market later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal's latest quarterly survey of housing-market conditions in 28 major metro areas found that inventories of homes for sale, as well as the number of distressed borrowers, remain very high in many areas. That portends more downward pressure on prices from bank foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though tax credits are providing a temporary boost, "we're still in a very fragile housing market," said Ivy Zelman, chief executive of Zelman &amp;Associates, a research firm, who doesn't expect a full recovery before 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes and condominiums hit a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.35 million in March, the National Association of Realtors reported Thursday. That compares with a 5.01 million rate in February and was up 16% from the depressed March 2009 rate of 4.61 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Journal survey found that Miami, Orlando and Tampa, Fla., Las Vegas, Phoenix and Atlanta have some of the highest concentrations of distressed borrowers at risk of losing their homes. Nearly 28% of homeowners with mortgages are at least 30 days late on payments in the Miami area, more than double the national average of 12.2%, according to LPS Applied Analytics. That rate stands at about 24% in Orlando and Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes already on the market is well above the national average in Charlotte, N.C., Jacksonville, Fla., Nashville, Tenn., Chicago and Philadelphia. In Charlotte, where bank cutbacks have increased unemployment, there are enough homes on the market to last 17 months at the average sales pace of the past year. That compares with 15 months in Jacksonville, 13 in the Long Island suburbs of New York and 11 in the New Jersey suburbs. A market generally is considered balanced when the supply is around six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among metro areas with relatively low rates of delinquent borrowers and for-sale inventories: Boston, Denver, Dallas, Houston, Minneapolis, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for home resales in March was $170,700, up 0.4% from a year earlier, the Realtors reported. A price index produced by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> in February was down 3.4% from a year earlier, the agency said. Realtors say prices for middle-class homes in the types of neighborhoods that attract investors and first-time buyers are flat or rising slightly, while higher-end home prices generally continue to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, real estate agents have a compelling pitch: Prices have fallen an average of about 30% across the country since peaking in 2006; mortgage rates are near their lowest levels in four decades; and many people who sign a contract to buy a home by April 30 can qualify for federal tax credits worth up to $8,000. "Now is the time to do something," said Bill Wilkerson, an agent at ZipRealty in Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Mr. Wilkerson's customers, Rebecca Ahlschwede, last week offered about $200,000 for a three-bedroom foreclosed home with a pool in Scottsdale, Ariz. Ms. Ahlschwede, a 31-year-old neurology technician who currently rents, said the $8,000 tax credit would be "a huge bonus."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit appears to be giving more of a boost to previously occupied homes than to new construction, as first-time buyers favor the short commutes of older neighborhoods. Ms. Zelman said the rise in sales of new homes appeared more moderate than many builders had hoped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rush to qualify for the credit will end after the April 30 deadline for signed contracts, though the resulting boost to completed home sales will continue to help monthly reports through June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those tax credits likely pulled forward sales that otherwise would have occurred later in the year. Partly as a result, "I think we're going to have a pretty soft second half" of 2010 for housing sales, said John Burns, a real estate consultant in Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank efforts to work out lower loan payments for some borrowers have delayed millions of foreclosures, but those who don't qualify are now increasingly losing their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com predicts that 1.9 million homes will be lost to foreclosures or related defaults this year and another 1.1 million in 2011. That compares with two million last year and 600,000 in normal times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unemployment remains high and is unlikely to improve much soon, some economists say. Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com, expects the unemployment rate to be 10.2% at year's end, up from 9.7% in March. At the end of 2011, he sees a still hefty 8.6% rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit conditions, already tight, will get tighter in at least one respect. Around a third of home sales in recent months have been financed by loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration, which allows down payments as low as 3.5%. But now, the FHA is tightening its terms somewhat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By early summer, the FHA plans to reduce the maximum amount a seller can contribute to the buyer's closing costs -- such as loan-origination, legal and appraisal fees -- to 3% of the home price from 6%. That means buyers will have to save more to meet closing costs. Mr. Burns said a survey of builders by his firm found they expected the FHA change to eliminate as many as 15% of potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists expect rates on standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgages to rise at least moderately from the recent level of 5% to 5.25%. Mr. Zandi expects a rate of about 5.7% by year's end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite these worries, Jacelyn Botti, who heads residential sales for seven mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states for <span class="companylink">Weichert Realtors</span>, said that home-sales contracts signed by the firm's customers in March were up about 26% from a year earlier in that area, and April was on track for another gain of more than 20%. Prices on lower-end homes are trending up in some areas, Ms. Botti said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newland Communities, a San Diego-based company that plans and develops communities in 14 states, says 761 homes sold in those communities in the first quarter, up 28% from a year earlier. Robert McLeod, chief executive officer of Newland, said Austin, Houston and San Diego were among the stronger markets for the company. He thinks recovering consumer confidence is helping sales. "It's all about job growth," Mr. McLeod said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG—China stocks skidded Monday in their biggest drop of the year and took other Asian markets with them, as investors reacted to fears that government action to cool that country's volatile property sector will slow economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Shanghai Composite index fell 4.8% to 2980.30, below the symbolically important 3,000 level. It was the biggest drop in mainland China's benchmark index since Aug. 31, and it is now down 9% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rest of Asia mirrored China's fall, in part over fears that government removal of loose money supply and bank lending could snuff out the nascent recovery in corporate profits. Japan's main index fell 1.7% to 10908.77, while Hong Kong's fell 2.1% to 21405.17. Markets also reacted to civil fraud charges filed against <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. in the U.S. on Friday and the impact of Iceland's volcano on airline stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors in China spent the day digesting weekend actions by the State Council to restrict speculative property investments. The targeted tightening measures followed similar moves last Thursday, as well as earlier bank-lending curbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's robust growth—11.9% in the first quarter—has investors worried that the government will have to take more actions to tame inflation down the road. "Whether we like it or not, it smacks of overheating," said Sanjay Mathur, Asia economist at <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland</span> in Singapore. He said Chinese government efforts to cool things down will take time and raises concerns of a "policy mistake."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move—as well as others in Asia to keep inflation at bay—has raised suspicions that companies won't be able to deliver the level of earnings that investors are expecting as borrowing costs rise. Australia, Malaysia and Singapore have also tightened monetary policy. India is expected to raise interest rates Tuesday for the second time this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The fear in China, and increasingly in other markets in the region is, if governments tighten policy, the earnings support won't be that strong," said Markus Rosgen, equity strategist for Citibank in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said valuations for Chinese stocks are at 2.1 times book value, historically rich levels for this stage of a recovery where earnings growth hasn't been firmly established.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A helicopter can hover for a while but eventually it runs out of fuel and has to land," Mr. Rosgen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China markets have traded generally flat over the past three months, staying within a 6% range. Monday's drop takes the Shanghai composite to its lowest level since March 15, and 50 points off its Feb. 2 yearly low of 2934.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's moves over the weekend included allowing banks to refuse mortgages to buyers who already own multiple properties. The moves also give local governments power to limit the number of property purchases an individual can make within a certain period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Linus Yip, strategist at First Shanghai Securities, said that although most Chinese property shares have lost between 15% and 20% in recent days, they may not have hit bottom yet. "Right now there is still some uncertainty [about further tightening] and it won't be easy for a technical rebound," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cinda Real Estate Co., Shanghai New Huangpu Real Estate Co., <span class="companylink">Yunnan Metropolitan Real Estate Development</span> Co., Oceanwide Real Estate Group and <span class="companylink">China Merchants Property Development</span> were among stocks that sank by the day's 10% limit on mainland bourses. Several banks also lost heavily, with Bank of Ningbo shrinking 9.3%, while <span class="companylink">China Merchants Bank Co</span>. skidded 6.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere in Asia, Taiwan's Taiex tumbled 3.2% to 7854.22, Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 slid 1.4% to 4915.07, South Korea's Kospi finished 1.7% lower to 1705.30 and India's Sensex shrank 1.1% to 17400.68.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singapore's Straits Times Index dropped 1.5% to 2960.93, Thailand's SET Index shed 1.3% to 726.29 and Indonesia's JSX gave up 1.7% to 2840.43. Philippine shares lost 1.9% to 3203.91, while New Zealand's NZX 50 shed 0.9% to 3282.20.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial stocks sank across the region after Goldman shares tumbled 13% Friday, marking the stock's biggest one-day dollar drop in its history. The Goldman fraud charges "certainly spooked investors in the U.S., and is likely to make the stock market undergo a short-term correction," said Lee Jin-woo, market analyst at Mirae Asset Securities in Seoul, adding "there are no signs yet that this matter will develop into a systemic risk issue for financial markets."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When finance ministers and central bankers jetted down to Washington last April for a meeting of the International Monetary Fund they pondered how deep the global recession would turn out to be and how long it would last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The IMF predicted the downturn would continue well into 2010 and the U.S., Europe and Japan wouldn't grow at all this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In hindsight, the gloom was excessive. But this year, policy makers could fall into the opposite trap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of forecasters are looking for 4% global growth in 2010 and 2011—not bad by past standards—with more than 3% growth in the U.S., somewhat slower in Japan and a double-digit advance in China. Time to party?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not the style of central bankers and finance ministers, at least in official sessions. They mull and qualify and debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some of the questions they'll be wrestling with at this spring's IMF confab, which takes place April 24-25:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What went right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On this one, the IMF attendees will pat themselves on the back for flooding the world with money, which picked up economies battered by plunging housing prices, rising unemployment and buckling financial institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country with the largest stimulus program, China, produced the largest increase in growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surprise: countries managed to act in a concerted fashion, deepening the impact of the stimulus. The concern: All those trillions of dollars look like they are producing a turnaround that's mild by historical standards. The fear: What happens when all that money is withdrawn from the system?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central bankers say they are conferring to make sure they don't all head for the exit at once and, so far, only a few banks have started to raise interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The IMF regularly nags them that the Great Depression in the 1930s and Japan's slump in the 1990s were extended when stimulus ended prematurely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How much can the world count on the U.S. consumer?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumers remain the single largest source of global demand, even if their clout isn't what it once was. <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> estimates U.S. consumer spending will account for one-fourth of the global total in 2010, down from about 35% in 2003. Still, the global recession spread to Latin America and Asia when U.S. buyers put away their credit cards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, U.S. consumer spending has turned upward and may continue that way for some time, says Economy.com economist Mark Zandi, who figures pent up demand will boost car and home sales. But the long-term outlook is hardly solid. Part of the reason for Mr. Zandi's short-term bullishness is that he figures about five million households aren't making payments on their mortgages, giving them as much as $60 billion to spend—for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What are the prospects for employment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pretty bleak. The IMF forecasts unemployment levels of 9%, on average, in wealthy countries through 2011, despite the recovery. Even China with its muscular growth record is a job-producing weakling. The country has added jobs at the rate of a little more than 1% a year says China expert Nick Lardy of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Joblessness—or fear of it—undermines consumer spending and the business investment tied to the consumer market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The German unemployment rate of around 8% didn't budge much during the recession. But that's hardly a sign of strength. It indicates how difficult it is in Germany to fire workers and how wary German employers are to hire them when the economy turns up, thus lengthening stagnation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How mercantilist will China become?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese economy is booming, but, for once, not because of a huge trade surplus. Last month, for the first time in six years, China ran a small trade deficit and may run another one this month. That's important as an indication that China is starting to power its growth with domestic consumption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the rest of the world, that's a plus, so long as China welcomes imports and investment. But that change could turn out to be short-lived, as the country's export machine revs up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A surge in Chinese exports is bound to boost protectionist reactions, which have been held in check thus far by the global crisis. A revaluation of the Chinese currency would help show that China seeks fundamental economic change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are banking crises really different from other crises?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff and University of Maryland economist Carmen Reinhart have examined financial crises over the past 200 years and found they produce recessions that last longer than average and are followed by weaker recoveries and, often, sovereign debt crises. Not a bad description of what's happened so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current recovery looks to be a lot weaker than the rebound from other sharp declines, which have averaged about 6% growth in the first year, estimates <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the problems in Greece, where the IMF looks set to intervene to stave off possible government default, may be the first of many such problems, said Mr. Rogoff, a former IMF chief economist, as governments struggle to get spending and borrowing under control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you have banking crises, you have a wave of international sovereign debt crises within two or three years," he said. "We're on track."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction climbed for a third straight month in March, and permits for future groundbreakings rose in a sign that builders are confident government tax incentives will continue to lift sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report showed consumers have become gloomier in April than they were the month before, despite signs of improvement in the job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The University of Michigan/Reuters consumer-sentiment index's preliminary reading for April fell to 69.5, the lowest reading since November 2002 and down from 73.6 at the end of March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer attitudes are generally driven by labor markets. The March jobless rate of 9.7% is likely holding down spirits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Households say they are still worried about weak labor markets, high foreclosures, expensive energy, and tight credit conditions," Insight Economics analyst Steven Wood said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 1.6% to a seasonally adjusted 626,000 annual rate from the prior month, the Commerce Department said Friday. Single-family housing starts fell 0.9% in March. That was offset by an 18.8% rise in apartment construction to 95,000. Within the volatile multifamily building category, groundbreakings of homes with five or more units rose 39.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year-over-year, overall housing starts in the U.S. last month were 20.2% higher than the pace of construction in March 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite lower prices and mortgage rates, the housing sector has been a weak spot in the recovering economy. Sales began retreating last fall, after a sharp run-up caused by buyers capitalizing on the first of two tax credits rolled out by the U.S. government over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builder confidence rose in April on expectations the second tax incentive will spur sales. A National Association of Home Builders confidence index climbed to the highest level in seven months in April.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Wingfield </div><div>978 words</div><div>15 April 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A17B</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the quest for vibrant, affordable neighborhoods, some Bay Area professionals are moving north -- way north, to Portland and Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott McNeely is a transplant to the Pacific Northwest who kept his job in the Bay Area. Mr. McNeely, online director for San Francisco-based Internet travel company Viator Inc., used to live in the Mission District. But several years ago, he and his wife began pining for more kid-friendly environs after becoming parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High real-estate prices across the Bay Area made moving even to the East Bay a stretch. So about 18 months ago, Mr. McNeely and his family moved 650 miles north, to Portland. There, they bought a four-bedroom house for about $350,000 that was large enough to accommodate his two children and a Great Dane. Viator agreed to let Mr. McNeely telecommute, with occasional trips to its San Francisco headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we were going to move to the equivalent of the suburbs of the Bay Area, why not move to a place like Portland?" says Mr. McNeely, 40 years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been a northward migration for years by Bay Area residents looking for everything from affordable real estate to better public schools. But moving usually meant giving up their jobs, which are generally more lucrative and plentiful here than in the Pacific Northwest, especially for technology workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now it is getting more practical for people to live in the Pacific Northwest and continue working for Bay Area-based companies, as more employers loosen their telecommuting policies. Technology also is making it easier to stay connected all the time, and travel between San Francisco and cities to the north has become more convenient, though hard data on Bay Area transplants to the Northwest who retain their local jobs are hard to come by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alex Payne plans to move to Portland with his wife next month, while keeping his job at San Francisco-based <span class="companylink">Twitter Inc</span>. Last October, Mr. Payne caused a stir when he blogged about his frustrations with San Francisco's quality of life, including criticisms of its public transit and high cost of living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, the 26-year-old believes Portland is a "model of urban design." Mr. Payne is especially impressed with the revitalization of Portland's Pearl District, a once-grimy industrial neighborhood that now teems with art galleries and restaurants. Portland's lower property costs also are appealing, though he initially plans to rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's actually affordable by mere mortals," Mr. Payne says. "I looked at buying a place in San Francisco, but you're talking a half million dollars for a hovel."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco's median home value in late February was $691,600, compared with $362,800 for Seattle and $236,100 for Portland, according to real-estate site <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>. San Francisco's median home price increased 1.1% over the past year, while the average price fell 7.1% in Seattle and 9.9% in Portland, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is easier to take advantage of the lower cost of living up north when Bay Area immigrants are able to bring their salaries with them. The average base salary for Bay Area tech workers is $101,701, compared with $86,816 in Seattle and $75,241 in Portland, estimates online career site Glassdoor Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there are downsides to the long-distance arrangement. Mr. McNeely, for one, says traveling to San Francisco every few weeks can be a challenge because he has young children. He also finds it hard accepting that he is a visitor in the city that was once his home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Payne says his biggest worry about his move is that he will miss out on chance conversations with co-workers. From Portland, he plans to rely heavily on video conferencing and screen-sharing technology that will allow him to collaborate with other Twitter engineers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Payne says the short plane ride between Portland and San Francisco -- about one hour and 45 minutes -- was a big factor in making the arrangement work, since he plans to spend four or five days a month at Twitter's headquarters. Twitter will reimburse him for the flights. In Seattle, commuters can now bypass the city's thick traffic by hopping on a light-rail line to the airport, while San Francisco and Portland began offering similar transit options in the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also is easier for commuters along the West Coast to stay connected while in the air. <span class="companylink">Virgin America</span>, with Seattle-to-San Francisco fares of $79 each way, has become especially popular with the tech set, because it offers in-flight Wi-Fi Internet access and power outlets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alaska Airlines recently began running advertisements promoting flights between Portland, San Jose and Austin as "nerd birds," because of the preponderance of tech-industry commuters shuttling between those locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past seven years, Joe Steele has commuted weekly from the Seattle area to his job south of San Francisco as a vice president at <span class="companylink">Gilead Sciences Inc</span>., a biotech company in Foster City, Calif. Mr. Steele, a 15-year employee at Gilead, moved to the Pacific Northwest after a short stint for the company in Boulder, Colo., so he could be closer to family in the region and to enjoy amenities that would be far more costly in Northern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His home in Vaughn, Wash., about an hour southwest of Seattle, is on 12 acres and includes space for a barn and three horses. "We would not be able to find a place like this in the Bay Area," says Mr. Steele, who pays for his own flights to Gilead headquarters.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi </div><div>933 words</div><div>14 April 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is set to find out Wednesday whether the ambitious price the state put on a portfolio of two dozen office buildings is realistic or California dreaming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state is hoping dozens of investors will bid on the closely watched portfolio -- which includes the San Francisco Civic Center and the Junipero Serra state building in Los Angeles -- driving the value of the deal to more than $2 billion including debt. That would net as much as $1 billion for the state after it pays off the debt on the property, which is in the form of bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state originally hoped to net about $660 million from the sale. Officials are hoping for more thanks to the strong investor interest and because the cost of retiring the bonds could be less than projected, according to people familiar with the transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some real-estate investors who have looked at the properties predict California will have trouble hitting its price for the portfolio, which includes some 7.3 million square feet of office space in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento, Oakland and Santa Rosa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state's plan is to lease back the buildings from the buyer for 20 years at rents that would produce roughly a 7% return for an investor who paid $2.1 billion for the portfolio. "We're hoping that the low risk of the state buildings and guaranteed tenancy" will drive up the price, says Jeffrey Young, a spokesman for the California Department of General Services, charged with managing California's massive real-estate holdings. "We know it's aggressive and unprecedented, but these are unprecedented buildings."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California's financial crunch might turn off some prospective bidders, however. Many landlords look favorably on large, creditworthy tenants who will sign long-term leases, because the guaranteed income stream lowers their future risks. But California's credit took a hit over the summer when state leaders failed to agree on budget solutions and California began issuing individual registered warrants -- essentially IOUs -- to pay its bills. Fitch Ratings has an A-minus credit rating on California, the lowest rating for any state in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, unlike most sale-lease-backs, the new owner or owners would provide trash, security and other property-management services to the state. It is more typical for tenants to take on all operating costs in sale-lease-back transactions and, when they don't, it can into profits for the building owner. That is because the owner will be on the hook to pay the costs of those services, which are likely to rise, says Gordon DuGan, chief executive of W. P. Carey &amp;Co., a New York company that specializes in sale-lease-backs. Mr. DuGan says his firm is planning to put in a bid on part of the portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors could get the same 7% return by buying California municipal bonds, without taking on the expense risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the state's sale-lease-back plan and aggressive pricing will likely cut out the many private firms and REITs that are scouting the commercial-real-estate market for distressed properties they can add value to by leasing up and the selling off at a profit in a few years. Shooting for a price of more than $2 billion "sounds aggressive," Mr. DuGan says. "It will be a real test of the commercial-real-estate market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, some of the roughly 450 registered bidders have decided to pass, according to people familiar with the transaction. Among them is privately held Beacon Capital Partners of Boston. The company passed on the cluster of properties after determining that they didn't fit its strategy, according to people familiar with the deal. The portfolio's many Sacramento buildings don't match up with Beacon's typical focus on larger cities. While the state has expressed a willingness to consider individual property sales, some bidders expect the state to give preference to buyers interested in the full portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. DuGan says many more investors would be attracted to the deal if the yield was closer to 9%. But that wouldn't likely be accepted by the state, as it would reduce the price to the $1.6 billion range, and the net proceeds would likely be in the $500 million range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is of course the possibility no deal will get done at all. Political controversy will likely put pressure on the state to walk away from negotiations rather than accept bargain-basement offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jerry B. Epstein, a longtime member of the Los Angeles State Building Authority, which must approve the payoff of the bonds, said in an interview that he was fired last month after he asked for a market study that would compare the cost of renting the buildings with keeping them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, the California Department of General Services' Mr. Young said that Ron Diedrich, the acting director of the department, found replacements for Mr. Epstein and another member of the authority -- along with two members of a similar authority in San Francisco -- because Mr. Diedrich was looking for members more aligned with new state initiatives that are moving away from owning real estate. But Mr. Epstein says the timing of the sale amid the distressed real-estate market makes no sense. "This is a gift to the developers, who are going to get this at a fire sale," Mr. Epstein says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—The Obama administration's efforts to spur home sales, lower interest rates and stem foreclosures have laid the foundation for an emerging housing recovery, the administration's top housing official said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Shaun Donovan, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, warned that the housing recovery remained fragile and that the market wasn't "out of the woods" because foreclosures continue to mount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Not only does the market still struggle with uncertain house prices, but more importantly, families still struggle to stay in their homes," Mr. Donovan said in prepared remarks to mortgage bankers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing secretary said that since home prices bottomed last spring, homeowner equity erosion has reversed course and that homeowners have gained an average $13,000 over the past year, after an average $80,000 peak-to-trough equity loss. While data show that home sales stalled earlier this year, he said there were also encouraging signs of a rebound in sales this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Donovan said the administration remained committed to unwinding heavy government housing support as soon as private money was ready to return. He pointed to signs that that may be occurring already with the imminent offering of a $200 million securitization of "jumbo" loans, those too large for government backing. "This is an additional encouraging sign that private capital is beginning to return to the housing market as the government carefully steps back," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Donovan conceded that the administration had underestimated the ability of loan servicers that collect mortgage payments to handle the volume of applications for loan modifications under the administration's Home Affordable Modification Program. But he also faulted banks for being "slow to make the investments in systems and staff needed to process applications."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beginning next month, he said, the administration would regularly release a "housing scorecard" to gauge the successes and failures of the administration's policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the administration said it would expand those efforts to help unemployed borrowers and those who are "underwater," or who owe more than their homes are worth. The Federal Housing Administration, for example, will allow some underwater borrowers to refinance into smaller loans if investors and lenders are willing to take a loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That program won't be up and running until the fall, but it could offer greater capacity to process applications because it will rely on loan originators and not servicers, Mr. Donovan said. He also touted the program as one that will require lenders and investors, and not taxpayers, to bear the "vast majority of the burden of writing down these loans."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While those new programs will offer greater payouts to banks that reduce loan balances, he pushed back against criticism that the administration should do more to modify loans by reducing balances. Some policy makers and many bankers have warned that widespread efforts to write down loan principal could encourage more borrowers who are current on their loans to default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Taxpayers have already paid a very heavy price for the irresponsible and sometimes unethical behavior of those that precipitated the crisis," he said. "They should not be asked to absorb the substantial costs associated with writing down underwater mortgages, which could run in the hundreds of billions of dollars."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Donovan, whose agency oversees the Federal Housing Administration, defended the growing role of that agency, which accounts for nearly one-third of new mortgages and requires down payments of just 3.5%. "Had the FHA not fulfilled the historic responsibility established in its founding…there's little doubt that the housing crisis would have been far more severe," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help smaller lenders sell their loans to Ginnie Mae, which guarantees payments to investors on government-backed loans that are sold as securities, the agency will begin allowing lenders to securitize single loans and to issue loans on a daily rather than weekly basis, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The speech came as Mr. Donovan prepared to testify Wednesday on the future of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the government-controlled mortgage-finance giants. He dismissed calls for "hasty action" on the companies that he said threatened to roil still-shaky mortgage markets, even as the administration pushes ahead with a financial-regulatory overhaul bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Donovan said there was "plenty of blame to go around" for the housing meltdown, including loan officers and brokers that pushed risky loans, banks that turned "a blind eye to these practices" by packaging those loans into securities, borrowers that used their homes like "ATMs," and policy makers that pushed homeownership at the expense of rental housing.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Craig Karmin and James R. Hagerty </div><div>768 words</div><div>12 April 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>21</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just this past week, a Tudor mansion in Bel-Air belonging to film star Nicolas Cage was in foreclosure auction and reverted to the lender. On Wednesday, Richard Fuscone, a former top Wall Street executive, declared personal bankruptcy, forestalling a foreclosure auction that had been scheduled this week on his 14-acre Westchester mansion outside New York City. Last month a Manhattan condominium owned by Italian film producer Vittorio Cecchi Gori was sold in a foreclosure auction for $33.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February alone, 352 homes nationwide in this category were scheduled for foreclosure auction, the final step before a bank acquisition. That is the largest monthly number of these so-called notices of sale since the financial crisis began. By comparison, in all of 2009, there were 1,312 such notices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the super-wealthy are among the last to lose their homes in a mortgage crisis because they usually have high savings, better access to credit and other means for staving off foreclosure. But many of them work in financial services and other industries hit especially hard by the crisis, and have seen their wealth shrink in the market crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the numbers are modest compared with foreclosures at other income levels, they suggest the possibility of a sudden spike in bank takeovers of the wealthiest Americans' property. Typically half the notices of sale result in homes being turned over to creditors, though the figure could be slightly lower for the richest Americans who have more financial options, according to Daren Blomquist at RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big borrowers are more likely to default than ordinary people, according to data from First American CoreLogic. Its loan database, reflecting more than 80% of the overall home-loan market, includes 1,700 loans with balances of $4 million or more. About 14.8% of those loans were 90 days or more overdue at the end of January, compared with 8.7% for all home loans tracked by First American. Sam Khater, a senior economist at First American, said the bigger borrowers may be more prone to stop making payments when they have lost all their home equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fuscone, <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>'s one-time head of Latin America, put his mansion up for sale in November, asking $13.9 million. But he couldn't find a buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The court had scheduled a foreclosure auction for Thursday for the mansion -- with two swimming pools, two elevators, six fireplaces, 11 bathrooms and a seven-car garage. The personal bankruptcy filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court Wednesday temporarily freezes the foreclosure process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reached by phone, Mr. Fuscone declined to comment. Brokers and real estate tracking companies say that his home is one of the most expensive properties to face foreclosure proceedings yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the New York area, banks have taken over homes with loans of $5 million or more in Georgia, North Carolina and Colorado, RealtyTrac says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cage had tried to sell his Bel-Air property for $35 million but failed to get any offers, said James Chalke, a real-estate agent who had the listing. At a foreclosure sale Wednesday, the property attracted no bids from investors and so was acquired by the foreclosing lender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Annett Wolf, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cage, said that he had no comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A representative of Mr. Cecchi Gori, producer of more than 200 films including "Il Postino" and "Life is Beautiful," said his financial situation is improving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Florida's Miami-Dade County, the three largest foreclosure filings initiated against homes in the past six months involved a 4,655-square-foot home in Sunset Islands; a 8,443-square-foot house in Coral Gables; and a condo in Miami Beach, according to Peter Zalewski, a principal of Condo Vultures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Defaults began to surge in late 2006, mostly among borrowers with subprime mortgages, those for people with weak credit records or high ratios of debt to income. Defaults spread rapidly to better-heeled borrowers. At the end of 2009, nearly eight million U.S. households, or 15% of those with mortgages, were behind on mortgage payments or in the foreclosure process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealthy people have the means to stretch out the distress process, sometimes for years. "It's very, very difficult for these people to believe they've had such a severe reversal of fortune," says Maggie Navarro, a real-estate agent in Pasadena, Calif.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diane Keaton Relists Home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Dropping Price 16%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actress Diane Keaton has relisted her Beverly Hills, Calif., home for $10.95 million, 16% below its price tag last year. The seven-bedroom, nine-bath Spanish Colonial Revival house was on the market last year for just under $13 million, but was taken off after several months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The star of "Annie Hall" and "Something's Gotta Give" worked with designers on restoring the home, which has been featured in Achitectural Digest. The 1920s-built home was originally designed by California architect Ralph Flewelling, who also was the architect of the Beverly Hills fountain at the corner of Wilshire and Santa Monica boulevards. The house has an interior courtyard surrounded by archways, interior rooms with vaulted, dark wood ceilings and a yard and pool lined with olive trees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Keaton, who is known for her love of restoring homes, purchased this property in 2007, public records show. Aileen Comora and Paul Lester from the Westside Estate Agency in Beverly Hills have the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twitter's Williams Sells Loft</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twitter co-founder Evan Williams has sold his penthouse loft in San Francisco for $1.25 million, about 17% less than the $1.5 million he and his wife bought it for in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Williams, the chief executive of the micro-blogging service, and his wife, Sara Morishige Williams, were asking just under $1.5 million for the two-bedroom unit. Mr. Williams, who previously sold the online blogging service Blogger to <span class="companylink">Google</span> in 2003, wrote about the listing on Twitter in October, tweeting, "Buy my loft . . . It's a steal!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loft in the city's SoMa neighborhood has 11-foot-high ceilings and a patio. The couple, who had a baby in August, bought a four-bedroom home plus guest house in San Francisco's Noe Valley last year for $2.4 million, according to PropertyShark.com. A Twitter representative didn't respond to requests for comment. Eric Turner of McGuire Real Estate represented Mr. Williams. Ed Campana with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage represented the buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philanthropist Petrie Lists</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estate in Palm Beach</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philanthropist Carroll Petrie has listed her Palm Beach estate for $10.6 million. She purchased the 6,700-square-foot home in May 2008 for $7.45 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate, known as Elephant Walk, has been recently renovated and has an elaborate pool area and gardens. Surrounded by hedges, it is two houses from the ocean. The home has three great rooms with 12-foot ceilings, marble and wood floors and four bedrooms, each with a private bath. (There are also three bedrooms for staff.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Petrie is the widow of Milton Petrie, a retailer who died in 1994 at the age of 92. Ms. Petrie has donated tens of millions of dollars through the Carroll and Milton Petrie Foundation. The European sculpture court at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art is named after them, as well as departments at Beth Israel and Mount Sinai hospitals in New York. Gary Little and Toni Hollis at Fite Shavell &amp;Associates in Palm Beach have the listing. Ms. Petrie declined to comment.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Andrea Petersen and Jennifer Merritt </div><div>1408 words</div><div>8 April 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're aiming to organize a chaotic and cluttered home, the most dangerous place on earth may be the <span class="companylink">Container Store</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least that is what some professional organizers say. That is because most people leave that Mecca of boxes, bins, shelves and hooks (The stores carry more than 50 different types of CD holders alone.) without much of a plan. Armed with good intentions and a host of shiny new products, they often end up with just as much of a jumble. And even more stuff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is the biggest mistake people make," says Laura Leist, president of the National Association of Professional Organizers or NAPO, a trade group. "They think if they buy something to put their things in that is going to solve the problem." (A <span class="companylink">Container Store</span> spokeswoman says store employees -- who receive more than 240 hours of training on storage and organization -- can guide customers into making the right decisions about products.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most important part of organizing is actually throwing stuff away or "purging," Ms. Leist says. And that is where professional organizers say they can often be the most help, by gently and tactfully encouraging people to get rid of superfluous stuff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've all seen magazines showing freakishly organized homes: closets with precision-stacked linens; alphabetized spices; orderly toy cubbies and designated bill-paying stations. Glossy shots like these inspired four lifelong pack rats to get organized -- with a little help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professional organizers were asked to tackle everything from a home-office overloaded with piles of paper to a closet stuffed to the ceiling with a melange of baby clothes (the kids are teenagers), school artwork and even an old mattress and box spring. Testers in varied living situations -- from a two-story house in the Atlanta suburbs to a one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn, N.Y. -- were enlisted to hire organizers in our hometowns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, we were thrilled with the outcome and were amazed at how quickly we saw results. Forced to justify what we wanted to keep, we were able to be much more ruthless in our purging. (Though, one of our testers did resort to hiding some purge-worthy note cards from her organizer's eyes.) Our organizers kept us focused and on task, and definitely got their hands dirty, digging into the depths of closets and lugging bags of trash. So we were able to avoid what Ms. Leist says is the second biggest de-cluttering mistake: getting distracted and tackling multiple projects at once, never making much headway in any. All this hand-holding didn't come cheap. Our organizers charged between $75 and $100 an hour (for a two-person team). We also ended up shelling out more money -- one tester spent $400 -- for new storage items that our organizers recommended, but the experts we worked with were sensitive to our budget concerns. Two of our organizers came to our homes for an initial consultation and then returned for the actual organizing -- an approach that seemed to yield the best results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone can call himself or herself a professional organizer, though those with the designation of "Certified Professional Organizer" have passed an exam and have a minimum of 1,250 to 1,500 hours of hands-on work with clients. All of the organizers we worked with belonged to NAPO (Organizers are searchable by zip code at napo.net.) We also checked references from previous clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Brooklyn, we found Amanda Wiss of Urban Clarity through word of mouth. We wanted help with an entryway cluttered with shoes, coats, newspapers and baby gear and two front closets that were packed so tightly we could barely open the doors. After an initial consultation, Ms. Wiss sent us an email with a shopping list of low-cost storage items to buy from the <span class="companylink">Container Store</span> (A great place when you have a plan.) When she returned for four hours of actual organizing, Ms. Wiss had us take everything out of the closets and put items into four piles: one for trash, one for things we wanted to donate or sell, one for storage and one for items we'd keep in the apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She had a terrific solution for our biggest eyesore: the mounds of paper, books and other clutter that marred our beautiful six-foot-long dining room table (and often barely left us enough room to fit two dinner plates.) She had us buy an attractive "in-box" for the day's newspaper and mail and create a "project" shelf in one of our nearby bookcases to house the magazines we were saving to peruse later, travel books for an upcoming trip to Italy and novels we're reading. "Clutter is just delayed decision-making," she says. And the best part is that we've been able to maintain the systems she put in place: Weeks after her visit, we're still clutter free . . . relatively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Angeles, we hired Regina Lark of A Clear Path to tackle a room in a four-bedroom house that does double duty as a home office and guest room. Ms. Lark, who has a doctorate in history, started off by asking, "What's driving you crazy?" While she had us sorting through and purging the mounds of paper on and in our desks, Ms. Lark went through a closet stuffed with photo albums, stationery and office supplies. She had some novel ideas for how to deal with the deluge of memorabilia a family of four had acquired, including a poster the 13-year-old twins had made: Instead of letting it take up space in the closet, we should "take a picture of it and put it on your desk," she says. She also recommended that we "Keep one thing that is representative of a time period, like a picture or letter," instead of several mementos that will just collect dust and create clutter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan, we wanted help setting up after a move to a new, bigger apartment. We settled on In Order to Succeed because the company specializes in relocations. When Robin Reid Hunt arrived for a four-hour session she toured our seven-room apartment and immediately went to work making suggestions; adding hooks in the hallway for coats (so we could reform our prior habit of tossing coats on dining-room chairs) and a second rod for the closet in the children's room to expand room for clothes. Then we tackled our biggest issue: the kids' toys. Here is where we wish we'd had a consultation first -- and the opportunity to buy some new storage items before Ms. Reid Hunt did the actual organizing. The organizer did dive in and help us purge and categorize toys, but we knew we needed to buy a new, bigger storage unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We did end up buying something similar to what was recommended after our session, but by then we were on our own to do the final set up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Atlanta, we needed serious help. A deep basement closet was packed with baby clothes, lamps, mounds of memorabilia from a decade of living in Moscow, including nesting dolls and old newspapers, a mattress and even a papasan chair wedged up near the ceiling. Another closet was stuffed with files, luggage, pet food, cases of canned tomatoes and more old newspapers. We knew we had some serious editing to do. One of the best things about the company we hired, Chaos 2 Comfort, was that it recycles or donates purged items for you. Our two-person team was very sensitive to our feelings, suggesting we take a break when we felt overwhelmed and advising us to keep those items that had real sentimental value. In the end, we had five garbage bags full of clothes and toys for our organizers, Susan Fox and Teresa Taylor, to take to a local homeless shelter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that night we panicked: In our zeal, we had accidently tossed the blue sweat suit one of the kids had lived in as a toddler -- and we wanted it back. So we sheepishly called Ms. Taylor. Thankfully, the items hadn't been donated yet.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi </div><div>682 words</div><div>7 April 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These have been tricky times for the scores of funds hoping to take advantage of distressed opportunities in commercial real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the defaults and other problems mushrooming throughout the landscape, prices haven't fallen as much as they had expected. Some funds are still waiting on the sidelines. Others are forging ahead and doing deals. Still others have given money back to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Preston, a veteran Canadian retail developer who heads a company named North American Development Group, is in the forge-ahead category. For months, he sat on the sidelines with the lion's share of a $160 million fund that his company raised in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Mr. Preston has jumped back into the fray. Last month, the fund paid about $23.5 million for a regional shopping center in fast-growing Placer County, Calif., near Sacramento.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purchase capped a flurry of acquisitions that began last fall in which the fund snapped up seven existing U.S. shopping centers and five retail-development sites for a total of more than $110 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Preston was facing a deadline. His Sterling Land and Shopping Center Development Fund II had about three years to use the money committed by its investors, which included North American executives as well as <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>. The end of that investment period was coming up this month. The fund, which will keep some capital to stabilize and build out the properties, is now fully invested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other funds are in similar situations. "There's a lot of money and a lot of excitement about getting money out the door," says Suzanne Mulvee, a real-estate strategist with Property &amp;Portfolio Research, a unit of CoStar Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Preston says the deadline had nothing to do with the acquisitions. The fund could have gotten more time to use the capital it needed but opted to spend the money to take advantage of what it viewed as a narrow window of opportunity, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're not going to make an improper investment just because you have a time horizon," Mr. Preston says. "We've gone through an unprecedented period where we were able to buy quality existing shopping centers at distressed pricing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its most recent deal, the fund bought the 205,000-square-foot Rock Creek Plaza shopping center near Sacramento from Auburn Plaza Co., a California-based group that has owned the center since its construction in the early 1980s. The property is 100% leased to such tenants as <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span> and Kmart, and it recently underwent a roughly $8 million renovation. Fouy Ly of Sperry Van Ness represented both the buyer and seller in the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Preston says he got the property at a good price. Rock Creek's annual net operating income is about $2.2 million, meaning it is expected to yield a cash return of about 9% on the fund's investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the peak of the market, similar properties would have commanded returns in the 6.5% range, he says. In recent months, prices have begun to rise as an increasing number of buyers are bidding up prices, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The son of a small-town Canadian newspaper publisher, Mr. Preston founded the predecessor company to North American in 1977. The company developed shopping centers in Canada and the U.S., and today North American and its affiliates own or manage more than 19 million square feet of existing property or planned development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases in the stormy retail sector remain a bold move. Vacancies are at a 19-year high for strip malls, at 10.8%, and a record for regional malls at 8.9%, according tofirst-quarter statistics released Tuesday byReis Inc., a real-estate-research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Preston believes the worst is over, but he has hedged his bets. He says he is underwriting acquisitions to take into account declining rents and the potential for higher vacancies should some additional stores go dark.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is springtime for real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer I wrote that it was time to buy residential real estate if you were in the market and looking for a bargain. I never expect to call a market bottom, and certainly not for long-cycle assets like houses, but I seem to have come pretty close. The latest S&amp;P/Case-Shiller survey results, released last week, suggest housing prices bottomed out around April 2009, when its 20-city composite index was down 32.6% from its peak reached in June/July 2006. Since then it has gained 3% through January 2010, with some markets much stronger, especially San Francisco and Minneapolis. (Charlotte, N.C., Las Vegas, Seattle and Tampa, Fla., continued to hit new lows, but at a much slower rate of decline.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now it may be commercial real estate's turn. <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a commercial-real-estate-research firm, reported last week that average rents in the office sector dropped just 0.8% in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the last quarter of 2009. Rents were stable or rose in 23 of the 79 markets Reis tracks. This may not be a bottom, but it is a considerable improvement from just three months ago, when rents in 70 of the markets fell. Given the reporting gap, the bottom may well have been reached already.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If so, this moment has important implications for investors, the banking and real-estate sectors, and the economy as a whole. Last year I warned that commercial real estate was a "dark cloud" hanging over the banking industry, echoing comments that were coming from the Federal Reserve. Like many aspects of the financial crisis, the clouds seem to be dissipating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That isn't all that surprising, given the recent positive economic news. Unemployment seems to be stabilizing and even improving, and workers need office space. Consumers have been spending, returning to malls in droves. Rock-bottom interest rates have allowed strapped developers and real-estate owners to refinance on favorable terms. There is no doubt that many grossly overpaid at the height of the boom, and there have been some highly publicized defaults, like Tishman Speyer Properties' decision to walk away from the Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town apartment complexes in Manhattan. But despite big write-downs, most commercial-real-estate borrowers have had the cash flow to keep loan payments current or refinance to buy more time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is true that many commercial-real-estate assets have already rallied since bottoming in March 2009. Vanguard REIT Index Fund is trading above $51, a high for the year, and double what it was at its low for the year, to cite just one widely held example. Those who were willing to embrace considerable risk when the economy seemed to be collapsing have been rewarded, as they should be. Now that those risks have subsided, so have potential returns. But I still believe long-term investors will be rewarded. The Vanguard ETF generates a 3.8% dividend yield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It rarely is practical for individuals to invest directly in commercial real estate, but there are plenty of other ways to gain exposure thanks to mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, REITs and even individual stocks that are liquid and offer diversification. It probably never has been easier to participate in the real-estate sector. I suggest a mix: an exchange-traded fund, a managed mutual fund, one or more REITs and possibly some stocks of banks with significant commercial-real-estate exposure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a multitude of ETFs and mutual funds. Among publicly traded REITs, some of the biggest, best known, and most highly regarded are <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group</span>, <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span>, and Boston Properties. Among bank stocks, the biggest banks, like <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, have substantial commercial real-estate loans, but they amount to a relatively low percentage of their total. At the other extreme are <span class="companylink">Western Alliance Bancorp</span> and <span class="companylink">Zions Bancorp</span>, which, as of September, had some of the highest exposure to commercial real estate in some of the most troubled markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These two remain high-risk propositions in my view, and I don't own them. Western Alliance has doubled from its lows, but is down by a third from the $9 it hit last May. Zions has nearly quadrupled from its low of last March, but at $24, is still far from the $88 it hit in 2007. Neither is for the faint of heart, but both may offer higher potential returns. Many regional banks occupy a middle ground between the big money-center banks and the high exposure of these two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever mix you deem prudent, I believe it is time to re-evaluate your exposure to the real-estate sector. In my view, real-estate belongs in every diversified investment portfolio. I've been keeping some cash on hand designated for real estate, and it is time to put some of it to work.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BERLIN -- With stock markets stabilizing and private-equity investors hungry for cash, Europe could be on the crest of a wave of property initial public offerings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one of the first likely IPOs out of the chute, <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. and private-equity group <span class="companylink">Cerberus Capital Management</span> are preparing a public listing of <span class="companylink">GSW Immobilien</span>, a Berlin real-estate company. Goldman's Whitehall Funds and Cerberus bought GSW for 405 million euros ($546 million) in 2004. Analysts and people close to the listing preparations expect the IPO could bring in over 800 million euros. Goldman and Cerberus declined to comment on the IPO's details.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other IPOs are likely by private-equity firms that loaded up on debt-heavy acquisitions a few years ago and now must find cash to refinance in a credit-starved environment. With stock prices more buoyant, property investors are considering IPOs as a way to raise cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For that reason, all eyes will be on the performance of the GSW IPO. Before the acquisition, GSW was owned by the city of Berlin and did little more than administer public housing. Goldman and Cerberus modernized the company and strengthened its trading activities to boost profit. GSW has about 70,000 housing units around Berlin, ranging from the City Village apartment complex in a leafy neighborhood in southwestern Berlin, to refurbished apartments in former East Berlin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In preparation for its listing, the closely held company published results for 2007 and 2008 in Germany's Federal Gazette on March 24. The report said GSW generated revenue from rent of 190 million euros in 2008, compared with 186 million euros in 2007. Net income was 107.7 million euros, up from 72.2 million euros. Vacancies in its apartments fell to 5.3% in 2008 from 6.7%. GSW's debt-to-equity ratio rose to 40.3% at the end of 2008 from 37.8% a year earlier. Its property portfolio was valued at 2.5 billion euros at the end of 2008, up from 2.4 billion euros the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"GSW is very profitable," says Malte Maurer, head of residential investment at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>'s operations in Germany. "Anyone who knows the company's portfolio knows that it is undervalued."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city of Berlin, which had the ability to veto a listing of more than 50% of GSW, gave its approval last month, but only after Goldman and Cerberus agreed to pay an additional 30 million euros for the company on top of what they paid in 2004. Berlin's state legislature will vote on the listing on April 19, though analysts say parliamentary approval isn't needed. An IPO is likely in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-equity investors have spent well over 50 billion euros on public-housing acquisitions in Germany since 2000, according to data from Germany's Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development. But the momentum slowed sharply as public opposition to privatizations made elected officials reluctant to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most investors were encouraged by low interest rates and loaded the properties with debt. But few succeeded in carrying out their intended strategies and are now looking for an exit. "After the peak of the market in mid-2007, investors recognized that their trading model didn't work," says Michael Schlatterer, director of property-service group <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>'s residential valuation group in Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GSW's listing comes as shares in rival residential-property companies recovered over the past 12 months. Gagfah AG, controlled by <span class="companylink">Fortress Investment Group</span>, rose 112%. <span class="companylink">Patrizia Immobilien AG</span> rose 136%; the company's largest shareholder is Chief Executive Wolfgang Egger, who controls the company through asset-management firm First Capital Partner GmbH. <span class="companylink">Deutsche Wohnen AG</span>, whose largest shareholder is Oaktree Capital Management LP, is up 46% in the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Deutsche Annington</span>, the largest residential-housing company, is seen as a candidate for an IPO this year. "There are no immediate plans for an IPO," said a company spokesman. "But our shareholders have always said that a listing is an option."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house at 10512 Baldy Mountain Rd. in Sandpoint, Idaho, looks like just another vacant foreclosed home. Some appliances, a bathroom mirror and even the hot tub are missing. The dining room of the three-bedroom house has water damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this isn't your run-of-the-mill problem house. Call it an Extreme Foreclosure. The 3,678-square-foot McMansion is a product of the popular "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" reality television show. It isn't the only "Extreme" home to fall on hard times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each week, an average 9.4 million viewers tune in to ABC-TV for what, over seven seasons, has become a classic formula: Find a struggling family with a heart-tugging story and send them on vacation as an army of volunteers work frantically to replace an existing home with a much nicer and bigger one in just 106 hours. Each episode ends with a dramatic tear-filled tour of the new home, packed with donated furnishings, and outsize extras like a carousel or bowling lanes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after the cameras have gone, another trend has been developing: Homeowners struggle to keep up with their expensive new digs. In many cases, the bigger, more lavish homes have come with bigger, more lavish utility bills. And bigger tax assessments. Some homeowners have tapped the equity of their super-sized homes only to fall behind on the higher mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show's producers say they are making changes appropriate to current economic reality: downsizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in the boom, the makeovers got a little out of hand because of competition among home builders aware of the free publicity that came with the show and who tried to outdo previous projects. These days, the show is backing away from the boom-era showpieces. We "scaled back," says Conrad Ricketts, an executive producer for the show created and produced by <span class="companylink">Endemol USA</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average size of current makeovers is 2,800 to 3,000 square feet. A 2005 episode featured Milton and Patricia Harper's house in Lake City, Ga., that became a 5,300-square-foot English castle boasting five bedrooms, seven bathrooms, five fireplaces and an outdoor kitchen. Later that season, Nichol Okvath's family got a 5,346-square-foot house in Gilbert, Ariz., with six bedrooms, a movie theater and a carousel in the backyard. These days, the houses appear more subdued, eschewing such over-the-top amenities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A swimming pool is no longer a must, unless it could be used for therapy. When pools are built, the show explores a well system to help reduce water usage and costs. Lavish landscaping is out, working with the local environment is in. "We're not going to New Mexico, the desert, and trying to put sod down," Mr. Ricketts says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tracy Hutson, an interior designer who has been with "Extreme Makeover" since the beginning, says homes are receiving more earth-friendly products, such as low water-flow toilets and solar panels, curbing the giant electricity bills that caused a hardship for some families. "I think our hearts were in the right place, but we just got carried way," says Ms. Hutson. "It can be extreme without being the biggest house you've ever seen."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 2003, the 59-year-old Mr. Ricketts, who has worked in movies and TV for nearly three decades, was looking to develop a home-remodeling series. As he traveled down a "nice street" in Santa Clarita, Calif., he came upon a broken-down house that didn't seem to fit in. He learned the family had a child battling leukemia, leaving little money for maintenance. "I knew at that moment it was the soul of the TV show," Mr. Ricketts recalls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The California family's home was remodeled for the first episode airing later that year. But soon, remodeling gave way to razing and rebuilding houses, making for more dramatic television during the housing boom. As the show became more popular, donations flowed and builders got more and more ambitious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has since become part of pop culture, and, while plenty of makeover shows have come and gone, it remains the most ambitious, well-known and generous of the genre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also important to ABC when it comes to ratings and selling ads: Among broadcast networks, the show ranks second in the key female demographics and tops with children ages 2 to 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Huber Engineered Woods LLC</span> has donated its premium floor, wall and roof products for 25 houses. While TV viewers don't always see the brand, "connecting with builders and framers on job sites" has led to increased awareness and additional sales, says Matt O'Brien, vice president of commercial operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many families featured on the program, the Extreme Makeover experience has been a dream come true. But for some, the experience has been financially stressful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several owners have sought loan modifications to reduce their payments in order to stay in their homes, lenders say. Some families seek a quick-fix by trying to sell. But because Extreme Makeovers tend to be big, fancy residences plopped into working-class or rural communities, the houses can be a hard sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house in Sandpoint, which was owned by Eric Hebert, appears to be the first Extreme Makeover home to actually fall into foreclosure, in October. Mr. Hebert didn't answer requests for comment. But he told a local television station last year that "the biggest mistake I think that I made was I took too much money out on the house thinking that I was going to have a job, you know, in the future."</p>
