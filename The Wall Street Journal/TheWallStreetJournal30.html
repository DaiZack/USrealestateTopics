<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The heir to the William Gottlieb estate, which controls a giant swath of Manhattan real estate, has broken with his family's traditional buy-and-hold strategy by selling a downtown building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale of the townhouse at 79 Horatio St. marks the beginning of a repositioning of the family's holdings of more than 100 downtown properties that brokers have estimated to be worth as much as $1 billion. The townhouse, along with a building on East 10th Street, were listed in May by Neil Bender, the nephew of Mr. Gottlieb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for Mr. Bender said the estate has no other planned sales but was planning to add properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are currently disposing of two properties that do not fit with the company's development and growth plans," said Gregg Sullivan. "We anticipate the addition of significant and strategic properties to the portfolio in 2011 and beyond."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two buildings were listed last year shortly after Mr. Bender won a favorable New York court ruling following a bitter dispute with his sister that had divided the family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downtown real-estate agents suggest the battle had discouraged Mr. Bender from putting other properties up for sale. Some brokers remain hopeful that the estate will put more select property on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Gottliebs own some of the city's most prized property downtown," said Jonathan Isaacs, a co-founder of broker Aligned Real Estate. "The West Village inventory is extremely limited. I would love nothing more than to hear they are selling more property."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Horatio Street property, a white-brick townhouse built around 1880, is at a coveted Meatpacking District location, near the West Village and the High Line. But people who viewed the 6,750-square-foot property said it was in poor condition and would require gut renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was listed for $8.5 million and its sale closed late last month for less than $7 million, according to a person familiar with the matter. The buyer's identity wasn't made known.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some have wondered if the sale and the break with Gottlieb tradition of holding onto properties, especially during a period when prices remain well below recent highs, suggested that Mr. Bender was trying to raise cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax experts say many owners were motivated to sell high-priced property by year-end because they feared an increase in capital gains taxes in 2011, though lawmakers reached a mid-December compromise to avoid any increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Sullivan said the sale wasn't done to raise cash or for tax purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three-story East 10th Street property remains for sale at $6 million. Both properties were listed by Jonathan Phillips and Ginnie Gardiner of Halstead Property. Neither could be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The long-running feud among Mr. Gottlieb's heirs often spilled into the public spotlight. Retail and residential tenants sometimes complained that they were caught in the cross fire because, they said, during the dispute the buildings fell into disrepair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gottlieb started buying up downtown Manhattan property in the 1950s. When he died as a bachelor in 1999, he left his estate to his sister, Mollie Bender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Ms. Bender broke her hip, she petitioned to resign as executor to the will and requested her son Neil be named as the estate's administrator. Before that happened, Ms. Bender died in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her will left the Gottlieb estate to her son and her husband and excluded her daughter, Cheryl Dier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ORLANDO, Fla. -- Housing economists expect the troubled residential market to begin picking up in 2011, with low mortgage rates and bargain home prices boosting sales in the spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economists at the National Association of Home Builders' annual meeting noted the market remains extremely weak, prices are still falling, and they don't expect any recovery to be robust. But they said recent economic indicators have convinced them that housing sales, which have stalled lately, could soon begin to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy is creating new jobs, holiday sales came in better than expected, and sales of cars and furniture have improved, noted David Crowe, chief economist for the NAHB. Those trends, he said, are "signifying growing consumer confidence."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of abysmal construction and sales activity, Mr. Crowe expects builders to start construction on 575,000 single-family homes this year, up 21% from last year. That would still be far below the 2005 peak of 1.7 million housing starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAHB also expects new home sales to hit 405,000, up 26% from 2010, as buyers who delayed purchases ink deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the outlook for 2010 at last year's conference proved much too optimistic. At that time, the NAHB economist saw 610,000 single-family starts for 2010. The actual count, which isn't yet final, is expected to come in at 475,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Crowe says this year will be better as more jobs are filled and more buyers leave the sidelines. "Consumers are finally willing to go forward," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outlook for home prices is less upbeat. <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> Chief Economist Frank Nothaft expects home prices to bottom in the first half of this year, and mortgage rates to edge up slightly, ending 2011 closer to 5.25%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Berson, chief economist of mortgage insurer <span class="companylink">PMI Group</span>, believes prices will weaken further in the next few months, but end the year flat. Next year, he said in an interview, pricing will increase slightly.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The heir to the William Gottlieb estate, which controls a giant swath of Manhattan real estate, has broken with his family's traditional buy-and-hold strategy by selling a downtown building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale of the townhouse at 79 Horatio St. marks the beginning of a repositioning of the family's holdings of more than 100 downtown properties that brokers have estimated to be worth as much as $1 billion. The townhouse, along with a building on East 10th Street, were listed in May by Neil Bender, the nephew of Mr. Gottlieb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for Mr. Bender said the estate didn't expect to make many more sales but was planning to add properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are currently disposing of two properties that do not fit with the company's development and growth plans," said Gregg Sullivan. "We anticipate the addition of significant and strategic properties to the portfolio in 2011 and beyond."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two buildings were listed last year shortly after Mr. Bender won a favorable New York court ruling following a bitter dispute with his sister that had divided the family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downtown real-estate agents suggest the battle had discouraged Mr. Bender from putting other properties up for sale. Some brokers remain hopeful that the estate will put more select property on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Gottliebs own some of the city's most prized property downtown," said Jonathan Isaacs, a co-founder of broker Aligned Real Estate. "The West Village inventory is extremely limited. I would love nothing more than to hear they are selling more property."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Horatio Street property, a white-brick townhouse built around 1880, is at a coveted Meatpacking District location, near the West Village and the High Line. But people who viewed the 6,750-square-foot property said it was in poor condition and would require gut renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was listed for $8.5 million and its sale closed late last month for less than $7 million, according to a person familiar with the matter. The buyer's identity wasn't made known.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some have wondered if the sale and the break with Gottlieb tradition of holding onto properties, especially during a period when prices remain well below recent highs, suggested that Mr. Bender was trying to raise cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax experts say many owners were motivated to sell high-priced property by year-end because they feared an increase in capital gains taxes in 2011, though lawmakers reached a mid-December compromise to avoid any increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Sullivan said the sale wasn't done to raise cash or for tax purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three-story East 10th Street property remains for sale at $6 million. Both properties were listed by Jonathan Phillips and Ginnie Gardiner of Halstead Property. Neither could be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The long-running feud among Mr. Gottlieb's heirs often spilled into the public spotlight. Retail and residential tenants sometimes complained that they were caught in the cross fire because, they said, during the dispute the buildings fell into disrepair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gottlieb started buying up downtown Manhattan property in the 1950s. When he died as a bachelor in 1999, he left his estate to his sister, Mollie Bender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Ms. Bender broke her hip, she petitioned to resign as executor to the will and requested her son Neil be named as the estate's administrator. Before that happened, Ms. Bender died in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her will left the Gottlieb estate to her son and her husband and excluded her daughter, Cheryl Dier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three days after Ms. Bender's death, Ms. Dier filed objections to her mother's will and to the appointment of Neil and Irving Bender as preliminary executors of the estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She alleged that Neil was unfit to serve as the estate's administrator and that he was a "habitual drunkard," according to court records. A New York surrogate court had ruled there was no evidence that he couldn't handle estate affairs. In May, the appellate court upheld that opinion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mutual funds that invest in commercial real estate were star performers in 2010, up about 27%, more than double the gain of the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Usually, it's a mistake to chase last year's leaders, but Neuberger Berman investment managers Brian Jones and Steve Shigekawa think that there's still plenty of upside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a traumatic collapse that pushed prices of commercial real estate as much as 50% lower after the 2008 financial crisis, they believe that values have bottomed and that a multi-year recovery is under way, fueled by still-low interest rates, improving cash flows, rising demand and a scarcity of new development projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Messrs. Jones and Shigekawa run the top-performing $206 million Neuberger Berman Real Estate Fund (NBRIX), an institutional vehicle that opened to retail investors last June.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Individual investors must pay a 5.75% load and a 1.23% expense ratio. But the fund pays a dividend quarterly and has a 1.89% yield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jones says billions in real-estate debt will mature in the next few years. So far, banks generally have extended the maturity of loans rather than write them off. But that could change as bank balance sheets improve and the value of real estate rises, making write-offs less painful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a bank forecloses on the loan, takes the property back and wants to sell, real-estate investment trusts may be able to pick up a high-yielding building at an attractive price, thereby increasing the REITs' overall cash flow. That could lead to some juicy deals for well-capitalized public REITs and, by extension, Messrs. Jones and Shigekawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neuberger Berman Real Estate has outpaced at least 97% of its peers over the past three and five years. Last year, it was up 31.5%, which put it in the top 10th of all real-estate funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund's current top picks include: Public Storage (PSA), a large self-storage operator; <span class="companylink">Host Hotels &amp; Resorts</span> (HST); and <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group</span> (SPG).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sustaining the fund's recent gains won't be easy. But Messrs. Jones and Shigekawa argue that commercial real-estate values will keep climbing, because of easier access to the debt market and to equity capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They expect rising dividends to continue to attract retail investors, foreign capital and pension money. In short, in their view, the market is recovering nicely from its long, devastating illness.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Sand imported from the Bahamas. An indoor Olympic-size pool. Now all these developers need is a buyer. Betting the house on a multimillion-dollar spec home.]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A group of wealthy art collectors and philanthropists dined on risotto and listened to chamber music at a 10-bedroom estate on a private island off Florida's Biscayne Bay last month. The mansion isn't owned by a Russian oligarch or a certain NBA player who recently moved to town. It was built purely on speculation by developers in search of a buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its asking price: $60 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years into the housing bust, at a time when home values are hitting new lows in many markets, a small group of developers has plunged into the risky business of betting millions on high-end speculative homes. They are erecting amenity-rich mansions for wealthy buyers that they hope will materialize. While the vast majority of the "spec" market remains moribund, some developers, pointing to a handful of big sales and the recent recovery of the stock market, believe the world's wealthiest buyers are out again shopping for trophy mansions, often as second, third or fourth homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there aren't any national sales statistics for homes in this range, there are signs that purchases by the super-rich have begun to rebound. Though down from the peak three or four years ago, art auctions in New York and London in 2010 brought in total sales that far surpassed 2009, including an all-time auction record of $104.3 million for sale of a Giacometti sculpture in February, topped in May by a $106.5 million sale of a Picasso painting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current crop of newly built spec mansions on the market includes a five-bedroom, seven-bathroom ski home on 1.2 acres of land in Aspen, Colo.'s Red Mountain neighborhood. Built by a group of investors last year, it has hand-scraped wide-plank ash floors, an onyx-and-steel chandelier in the dining room and a garage that has a dock for charging hybrid or electric vehicles as well as a dog-washing facility. Price tag: $23.9 million. In New York's Hamptons, an eight-bedroom farmhouse-style home in Sagaponack, built last year, is on the market for $26 million. In Los Angeles, a minimalist house with a 26-foot-long fire trough and a home theater with stadium seating is on the market for $13.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents say brand-new construction appeals to those who may already have other homes around the world to maintain. Rob Giem, a broker based in Newport Beach, Calif., says new houses are the most attractive listings for his wealthiest clients, some of whom are older and don't want to spend years dealing with construction headaches. "They've worked very hard and the greatest commodity to them is time," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No mega-mansion is complete without the latest in high-tech gadgetry. Lighting, televisions, heat, hot-tub temperature and security systems can be controlled remotely via an iPad or cellphone, an important convenience for long-distance owners. Some incorporate green technology like hidden solar panels and geothermal heating. Though amenities like bowling alleys, massage rooms and master-suite kitchenettes have become relatively common, the latest crop incorporate a few new ones as well, like in-home beauty salons with manicure, pedicure and hairdressing stations; virtual golf rooms, dockage for super yachts and movie-theater-size screening rooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers of the $60 million Miami Beach house say the estate, which has cost them $30 million so far, has one of the state's first in-home projection 3-D movie theaters. The home, which was built by developers Shlomi Alexander and Felix Cohen, also has a hidden art vault, an elaborate security system and a wine room that can be accessed only via fingerprint identification. Materials like mother of pearl, rare marble and Austrian oak are used throughout. To find the right gold-flecked marble for the master bathroom, the developers say they flew to Italy to personally pick it out from a quarry. To get inspiration for the home's waterscape and pool, which has a waterfall cascading from the second floor, they visited the Amanyara resort in the Turks and Caicos Islands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Constructed on Indian Creek Island across a series of limestone pavilions, the 30,000-square-foot glass-fronted home is divided by waterways and koi ponds. Its architect, Rene Gonzalez, who was also a project designer on the Getty Museum in Los Angeles, describes it as a "conceptual" house that's supposed to feel like a private resort. There's a central courtyard with landscaped walls and a beach with several tons of sand imported from the Bahamas (chosen over local Florida sand for its pinkish color). Since the potential buyer likely will already own several homes, Oren Alexander, the developer's son and New York-based broker who is marketing the listing to buyers outside Miami, says the home's inclusion of furniture will be a big selling point. "The house is such a unique style I think only the developers can furnish it," he says. "And when somebody's buying a property they want it to be instant satisfaction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers of the Miami home say they're confident that they will not only sell the home for close to asking price, it will be off their hands by the end of the month. The elder Mr. Alexander says, "For this, you need just one guy who believes in it, and wants to buy it for his wife." Baseball player Alex Rodriguez toured the home while it was under construction, says Mr. Alexander, and responded so well to the design that it prompted him and Mr. Cohen to raise the asking price from what they initially planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nelson Gonzalez, a Miami Beach-based broker who handles high-end listings, including Jennifer Lopez's former home, says he has clients looking for newly built homes in the area but doesn't think the house will sell for nearly what the developers are asking. "I think it's very high-priced for what the market is," he says. "I don't think we're there yet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Angeles, one of the most aggressive spec mansion builders is Mohamed Hadid, who sold an estate in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles for $50 million, one of the highest-priced residential-real-estate transactions in the U.S. last year. Public records listed the buyer as Sarp Turanligil, the owner of a Turkey-based yacht and furniture production company. A representative for Mr. Turnanligil said he was managing some business for a company that bought the home and is no longer affiliated with the property. The home, which Mr. Hadid lived in before it was sold, was initially listed for $85 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though he says he's building spec estates at a slower pace than he was several years ago, Mr. Hadid's current crop includes a 100-acre gated community on a mountain ridge in the Beverly Hills Post Office area of Los Angeles that will have six spec homes, each priced between $30 million and $40 million. The development will be heavily secured, he says, and include its own vineyard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction is nearly complete on a 32,000-square-foot, three-story French chateau-style mansion on 1.2 acres across the street from the Beverly Hills Hotel, which he plans to officially put on the market for about $60 million in March. The house will have three swimming pools (including an Olympic-size one indoors), a ballroom that can hold 150 and a Moroccan-style room meant for entertaining and socializing after relaxing in the home's spa. A home theater will seat 60.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It will have to be managed like a small hotel," explains Mr. Hadid, who estimates monthly operating costs for the buyer to be around $50,000 to $100,000 in addition to annual taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another big bet sits on a winding, wooded lot on California's Belvedere Island, just across the bay from San Francisco. During a tour of the home's site a few months ago, Olivia Hsu Decker, the home's listing broker, pointed out a bullet-shaped yacht anchored in the water few hundred feet away. "That could be our buyer," said Ms. Decker, optimistically. (The Phillipe Starck-designed vessel is owned by Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it's completed next summer, the three-story home, which the developer says likely will list for $45 million, will have a projection-screen theater, a gym with a steam room and sauna and an elevator and sliding glass doors that will open almost the entire back of the house. "People at this end of the market always have money," says Jeff Paster, an investment manager who retired in 2008 and has been building luxury homes for eight years, including the Belvedere Island mansion. But the competition is steep: There are at least five mansions priced around $20 million and above that are officially listed as for sale on Belvedere Island, a rocky landmass that measures less than one square mile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risks for speculators are huge. Developers generally have to foot annual tax bills and carrying costs while the home waits for a buyer, which can sometimes take months and run into hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. A number of multimillion-dollar homes built during boom times have taken years for investors to unload, with dozens still left over on the market today at reduced prices. A mansion in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles now priced at $14 million has been on the market for more than two years and seen several cuts from its original asking price in 2008 of $21.5 million. In Newport Beach, Calif., a Pennylvania Dutch Colonial-style home on just under an acre with elaborate manicured gardens is listed for $23 million, down from its original asking price of $29 million in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, one of Los Angeles's best-known spec homes sold for $23.5 million, about half its initial asking price of $50 million in 2007. Broker Mauricio Umansky said the singer Prince rented the home for two years while it was on the market, and that he wasn't able to show it often during that time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the jaw-dropping price tags on these supermansions, many developers aren't asking nearly what they would have during the market's peak. In Palm Beach, Fla., builder Dan Swanson currently has an $84 million home adjacent to a large nature preserve that's been on the market since May. The project began three years ago, when he tore down two homes on a cul-de-sac and built a 27,000-square-foot house that has parking for more than 50 cars, a 60-foot swimming pool and six juice bars spread across the main and guest quarters. The asking price, he says, could have been more than $100 million several years ago.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Westport, Conn., Compound</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radio host Don Imus and his wife, Deirdre, have trimmed the price on their waterfront compound in Westport, Conn., by 17%, to just under $25 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-acre property, listed in 2005 and 2009 for $30 million, has a 10,000-square-foot Georgian Revival-style main house with six bedrooms, a guest house and a gatehouse. The property has 215 feet of sandy beach frontage. The Imuses bought the property in 1997 for $4.6 million and completed the home in 2000. Listing broker Darlene Letersky of Coldwell Banker says the couple is selling because they use the property infrequently.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A group of wealthy art collectors and philanthropists dined on risotto and listened to chamber music at a 10-bedroom estate on a private island off Florida's Biscayne Bay last month. The mansion isn't owned by a Russian oligarch or a certain NBA player who recently moved to town. It was built purely on speculation by developers in search of a buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its asking price: $60 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years into the housing bust, at a time when home values are hitting new lows in many markets, a small group of developers has plunged into the risky business of betting millions on high-end speculative homes. They are erecting amenity-rich mansions for wealthy buyers that they hope will materialize. While the vast majority of the "spec" market remains moribund, some developers, pointing to a handful of big sales and the recent recovery of the stock market, believe the world's wealthiest buyers are out again shopping for trophy mansions, often as second, third or fourth homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there aren't any national sales statistics for homes in this range, there are signs that purchases by the super-rich have begun to rebound. Though down from the peak three or four years ago, art auctions in New York and London in 2010 brought in total sales that far surpassed 2009, including an all-time auction record of $104.3 million for sale of a Giacometti sculpture in February, topped in May by a $106.5 million sale of a Picasso painting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current crop of newly built spec mansions on the market includes a five-bedroom, seven-bathroom ski home on 1.2 acres of land in Aspen, Colo.'s Red Mountain neighborhood. Built by a group of investors last year, it has hand-scraped wide-plank ash floors, an onyx-and-steel chandelier in the dining room and a garage that has a dock for charging hybrid or electric vehicles as well as a dog-washing facility. Price tag: $23.9 million. In New York's Hamptons, an eight-bedroom farmhouse-style home in Sagaponack, built last year, is on the market for $26 million. In Los Angeles, a minimalist house with a 26-foot-long fire trough and a home theater with stadium seating is on the market for $13.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents say brand-new construction appeals to those who may already have other homes around the world to maintain. Rob Giem, a broker based in Newport Beach, Calif., says new houses are the most attractive listings for his wealthiest clients, some of whom are older and don't want to spend years dealing with construction headaches. "They've worked very hard and the greatest commodity to them is time," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No mega-mansion is complete without the latest in high-tech gadgetry. Lighting, televisions, heat, hot-tub temperature and security systems can be controlled remotely via an iPad or cellphone, an important convenience for long-distance owners. Some incorporate green technology like hidden solar panels and geothermal heating. Though amenities like bowling alleys, massage rooms and master-suite kitchenettes have become relatively common, the latest crop incorporate a few new ones as well, like in-home beauty salons with manicure, pedicure and hairdressing stations; virtual golf rooms, dockage for super yachts and movie-theater-size screening rooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers of the $60 million Miami Beach house say the estate, which has cost them $30 million so far, has one of the state's first in-home projection 3-D movie theaters. The home, which was built by developers Shlomi Alexander and Felix Cohen, also has a hidden art vault, an elaborate security system and a wine room that can be accessed only via fingerprint identification. Materials like mother of pearl, rare marble and Austrian oak are used throughout. To find the right gold-flecked marble for the master bathroom, the developers say they flew to Italy to personally pick it out from a quarry. To get inspiration for the home's waterscape and pool, which has a waterfall cascading from the second floor, they visited the Amanyara resort in the Turks and Caicos Islands.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Constructed on Indian Creek Island across a series of limestone pavilions, the 30,000-square-foot glass-fronted home is divided by waterways and koi ponds. Its architect, Rene Gonzalez, who was also a project designer on the Getty Museum in Los Angeles, describes it as a "conceptual" house that's supposed to feel like a private resort. There's a central courtyard with landscaped walls and a beach with several tons of sand imported from the Bahamas (chosen over local Florida sand for its pinkish color). Since the potential buyer likely will already own several homes, Oren Alexander, the developer's son and New York-based broker who is marketing the listing to buyers outside Miami, says the home's inclusion of furniture will be a big selling point. "The house is such a unique style I think only the developers can furnish it," he says. "And when somebody's buying a property they want it to be instant satisfaction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers of the Miami home say they're confident that they will not only sell the home for close to asking price, it will be off their hands by the end of the month. The elder Mr. Alexander says, "For this, you need just one guy who believes in it, and wants to buy it for his wife." Baseball player Alex Rodriguez toured the home while it was under construction, says Mr. Alexander, and responded so well to the design that it prompted him and Mr. Cohen to raise the asking price from what they initially planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nelson Gonzalez, a Miami Beach-based broker who handles high-end listings, including Jennifer Lopez's former home, says he has clients looking for newly built homes in the area but doesn't think the house will sell for nearly what the developers are asking. "I think it's very high-priced for what the market is," he says. "I don't think we're there yet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Angeles, one of the most aggressive spec mansion builders is Mohamed Hadid, who sold an estate in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles for $50 million, one of the highest-priced residential-real-estate transactions in the U.S. last year. Public records listed the buyer as Sarp Turanligil, the owner of a Turkey-based yacht and furniture production company. A representative for Mr. Turnanligil said he was managing some business for a company that bought the home and is no longer affiliated with the property. The home, which Mr. Hadid lived in before it was sold, was initially listed for $85 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though he says he's building spec estates at a slower pace than he was several years ago, Mr. Hadid's current crop includes a 100-acre gated community on a mountain ridge in the Beverly Hills Post Office area of Los Angeles that will have six spec homes, each priced between $30 million and $40 million. The development will be heavily secured, he says, and include its own vineyard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction is nearly complete on a 32,000-square-foot, three-story French château-style mansion on 1.2 acres across the street from the Beverly Hills Hotel, which he plans to officially put on the market for about $60 million in March. The house will have three swimming pools (including an Olympic-size one indoors), a ballroom that can hold 150 and a Moroccan-style room meant for entertaining and socializing after relaxing in the home's spa. A home theater will seat 60.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It will have to be managed like a small hotel," explains Mr. Hadid, who estimates monthly operating costs for the buyer to be around $50,000 to $100,000 in addition to annual taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another big bet sits on a winding, wooded lot on California's Belvedere Island, just across the bay from San Francisco. During a tour of the home's site a few months ago, Olivia Hsu Decker, the home's listing broker, pointed out a bullet-shaped yacht anchored in the water few hundred feet away. "That could be our buyer," said Ms. Decker, optimistically. (The Phillipe Starck-designed vessel is owned by Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko.)&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it's completed next summer, the three-story home, which the developer says likely will list for $45 million, will have a projection-screen theater, a gym with a steam room and sauna and an elevator and sliding glass doors that will open almost the entire back of the house. "People at this end of the market always have money," says Jeff Paster, an investment manager who retired in 2008 and has been building luxury homes for eight years, including the Belvedere Island mansion. But the competition is steep: There are at least five mansions priced around $20 million and above that are officially listed as for sale on Belvedere Island, a rocky landmass that measures less than one square mile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risks for speculators are huge. Developers generally have to foot annual tax bills and carrying costs while the home waits for a buyer, which can sometimes take months and run into hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. A number of multimillion-dollar homes built during boom times have taken years for investors to unload, with dozens still left over on the market today at reduced prices. A mansion in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles now priced at $14 million has been on the market for more than two years and seen several cuts from its original asking price in 2008 of $21.5 million. In Newport Beach, Calif., a&nbsp;Pennsylvania Dutch Colonial-style home on just under an acre with elaborate manicured gardens is listed for $23 million, down from its original asking price of $29 million in 2007.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, one of Los Angeles's best-known spec homes sold for $23.5 million, about half its initial asking price of $50 million in 2007. Broker Mauricio Umansky said the singer Prince rented the home for two years while it was on the market, and that he wasn't able to show it often during that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the jaw-dropping price tags on these supermansions, many developers aren't asking nearly what they would have during the market's peak. In Palm Beach, Fla., builder Dan Swanson currently has an $84 million home adjacent to a large nature preserve that's been on the market since May. The project began three years ago, when he tore down two homes on a cul-de-sac and built a 27,000-square-foot house that has parking for more than 50 cars, a 60-foot swimming pool and six juice bars spread across the main and guest quarters. The asking price, he says, could have been more than $100 million several years ago.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radio host Don Imus and his wife, Deirdre, have trimmed the price on their waterfront compound in Westport, Conn., by 17%, to just under $25 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-acre property, listed in 2005 and 2009 for $30 million, has a 10,000-square-foot Georgian Revival-style main house with six bedrooms, a guest house and a gatehouse. The property has 215 feet of sandy beach frontage. The Imuses bought the property in 1997 for $4.6 million and completed the home in 2000. Listing broker Darlene Letersky of Coldwell Banker says the couple is selling because they use the property infrequently.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks rallied to fresh two-year highs as improving manufacturing conditions and rising construction spending added to investors' hopes for the economic recovery to continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 126.35 points, or 1.1%, to 11703.86 in midday trade. It was the third time in a row that the measure has risen on the first trading day of the year and putting it on track for its fourth gain in the last five sessions. The Dow reached 11711.47, its highest intraday level since August 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A positive start to the year also tends to bode well for the rest of the year; since 1945, when the S&amp;P 500 has risen on the first day of the year, it has averaged a gain of 10.6% for that year, according to Birinyi Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> led the measure's climb, jumping 5.1%.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After dragging the U.S. economy into a severe recession, property markets across the country now are relying on an economic recovery to help cure their hangover in the new year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector, weighed down by a glut of unsold homes, needs job growth to boost demand and curb the flow of delinquent loans into foreclosure. For commercial real-estate investors, lackluster hiring means fewer new jobs to fill empty office space and less consumer confidence to drive activity in stores and distribution warehouses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The No. 1 biggest risk is that, for whatever reason, the overall economy does not grow sufficiently to produce any meaningful rebound in jobs," said Thomas Lawler, a housing economist in Leesburg, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For housing markets, the past year was another bumpy ride. Home prices stabilized in the first half of 2010 as the government offered tax credits to spur sales, but transactions plunged to 15-year lows after that stimulus expired. Sales have rebounded only modestly and at the current pace, it would take 9 1/2 months to work through the volume of existing homes listed for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market dodged a bullet in March when the Federal Reserve ended its purchases of $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities. Many analysts expected rates to rise, but they defied expectations by falling to 60-year lows, thanks first to the European debt crisis and later as the U.S. recovery faltered. (As the year ended, rates were rising but they remained historically low.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tail winds to spur a recovery are gathering. Large price declines have made housing more affordable than at any point in the last decade. New housing construction is stuck at its lowest levels in more than 40 years. "That will help absorb supply in ways that a lot of people underestimate," Mr. Lawler said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sellers also still will have to chop prices. Overall, prices are down 29.6% from their July 2006 peak to October 2010, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller price index. Many analysts expect home prices to decline by an additional 5% before stabilizing later this year. "We're bouncing along a bottom," said Ivy Zelman, chief executive of housing research firm Zelman &amp; Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, credit standards are still tight. And while mortgage delinquencies peaked in February 2010, foreclosures could remain at an elevated level for years as banks work through a huge backlog. The most realistic "best case" scenario for 2011 would "simply be a year in which things do not get worse," wrote <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> housing analysts in a research report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the most stubborn problems is the 10.8 million homeowners who owe more than their homes are worth, or 22.5% of all mortgage borrowers, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing faces additional uncertainty because the government is set to reconsider how aggressively to support homeownership. Deficit hawks have their sights set on scaling back the mortgage-interest deduction, and the Obama administration later this month will put forth a proposal on how to revamp <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and the broader mortgage market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What goes on in Washington will be of critical importance to housing," said John Burns, an Irvine, Calif.-based home-building consultant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another wild card: Regulators and prosecutors could uncover sloppy practices from the heyday of the housing boom. In September, some of the nation's largest banks, including units of <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>., were forced to suspend foreclosures due to potentially fraudulent document-handling procedures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks say they haven't evicted anyone who hasn't defaulted, but the foreclosure machinery has been slow to restart nonetheless. Some real-estate lawyers warn that problems could be worse if it turns out that loans weren't properly recorded or transferred during the process of bundling mortgages and selling them as securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks already face rising costs as foreclosures become more time-consuming. Investors, meanwhile, are pursuing new efforts to force banks to buy back money-losing mortgage bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In commercial real estate, last year saw some markets start to come back after a dreadful 2009. The biggest winner: Washington, where the federal government sustained demand for office space from contractors, lawyers and lobbyists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More broadly, downtowns across the country have seen things start to turn around, while suburban areas are still reeling from excessive construction and the economic ripple effects of the housing bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vacancy rates are near historic highs, from 10.9% in retail space to 17.6% for office buildings across the country, according to data firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>. The pace of construction starts for hotels, office buildings and other kinds of commercial real estate is still falling, with the total of $47 billion in commercial construction starts from January to November 2010 more than 8% below the same period the previous year, according to Reed Business Information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the economy does start posting a stronger recovery, investors will be watching how commercial real estate responds. There is concern that companies are figuring out how to use less space per employee, reducing new office-space demand, while the growing popularity of online shopping could eat into demand for retail space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the financial markets, things are looking up. The market for commercial mortgages sliced, diced and sold on Wall Street is widely expected to expand this year amid investor demand and more certainty about where the real-estate market is heading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> predicts that some $45 billion in commercial-mortgage bonds will be issued for U.S. assets in 2011, well above last year's level of roughly $10 billion but still a pittance compared to the 2007 peak of $228 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For both landlords and lenders, amid falling rents and rising vacancies, low interest rates were a saving grace in 2010. As long as rates stay low, many commercial-real-estate players should be able to ride it out this year, as well.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial claims for unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level in more than two years, offering another hopeful sign that the job market is improving as the economy regains some momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New claims fell 34,000 to a seasonally adjusted 388,000, the lowest since July 2008, the Labor Department said Thursday. The four-week moving average for claims, a measure used to smooth volatility in the weekly data, fell to 414,000 from 426,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measure is closely watched because it gives one of the earliest indications of how many people are losing jobs. But the latest drop may have been exaggerated by Christmas week, which complicates how claims are counted. New claims fell sharply around the same time the past two years and then moved higher in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the report was seen as encouraging. "While the degree of decline may be overstated because of the seasonal issues, the trend is pretty clear," said John Silvia, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>. "That gives me a lot of hope and expectation for better job growth going forward."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He expects the economy to add about 160,000 jobs a month on average in 2011, compared with about 90,000 a month in 2010. But at that pace, it would still take years to replace the 8.4 million jobs lost after the recession started. The Labor Department reports next Friday on the number of jobs added and the unemployment rate in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That report is based on a survey taken in mid-December. In the wake of a surprisingly weak report for November -- 39,000 jobs added -- analysts are expecting more than 100,000 jobs were added in December, though their predictions often prove far from the actual tally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other gauges of employment are turning positive, suggesting that a gradually accelerating economic expansion could translate into sustainable job growth. Surveys of purchasing managers show continued employment gains in the manufacturing and service sectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors on Thursday said its index of pending home sales rose 3.5% in November, indicating stronger sales of existing homes. The measure uses contract signings to forecast sales of existing homes in the next two months.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most economists concede that a lasting general recovery in the U.S. is unlikely without a recovery in its housing market. A marked increase in defaults and foreclosures from today's already elevated levels could produce losses that overwhelm banks and trigger another, deeper financial crisis. Study after study has shown that defaults go up when falling prices put mortgage holders "underwater." As a result, the trajectory of home prices has tremendous economic significance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year market observers breathed easier when national prices stabilized. But the "robo-signing"-induced slowdown in the foreclosure market, the recent upward spike in home mortgage rates, and third quarter 2010 declines in the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller home-price index -- including very bad October numbers reported this week -- have sparked concerns that a "double dip" in home prices is probable. A longer-term view of home price trends should sharply magnify this fear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even those economists worried about renewed price dips would be unlikely to believe that the vicious contractions of 2007 and 2008 (where prices fell about 30% nationally in just two years) could return. But they underestimate how distorted the market had become and how little it has since normalized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By all accounts, the home price boom that began in January 1998, when the previous 1989 peak was finally surpassed, and topped out in June 2006 was extraordinary. The 173% gain in the Case-Shiller 10-City Index (the only monthly data metric that predates the year 2000) in those nine years averaged an eye-popping 19.2% per year. As we know now, those gains had very little to do with market fundamentals, and everything to do with distortionary government policies that mandated loans to marginal borrowers, and set off a national mania for real-estate wealth and a torrent of temporarily easy credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we assume the bubble was artificial, we can instead imagine that home prices should have followed a more traditional path during that time. In stock-market terms, prices should have followed a trend line. When you do these extrapolations (see lower line in the nearby chart), a sobering picture emerges. In his book "Irrational Exuberance," Yale economist Robert Shiller (co-creator of the Case-Shiller indices along with economists Karl Case and Allan Weiss), determined that in the 100 years between 1900 and 2000, home prices in the U.S. increased an average 3.35% per year, just a tad above the average rate of inflation. This period includes the Great Depression when home prices sank significantly, but it also includes the frothy postwar years of the 1950s and '60s, as well as the strong market of the early-to-mid 1980s, and the surge in the late '90s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January 1998 the 10-City Index was at 82.7. If home prices had followed the 3.35% annual 100 year trend line, then the index would have arrived at 126.7 in October 2010. This week, Case-Shiller announced that figure to be 159.0. This would suggest that the index would need to decline an additional 20.3% from current levels just to get back to the trend line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How has the market found the strength to stop its descent? No one is making the case that fundamentals have improved. Instead, there is widespread agreement that government intervention stopped the free fall. The home buyer's tax credit, record low interest rates, government mortgage-assistance programs, and the increased presence of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and the Federal Housing Administration in the mortgage-buying business have, for now, put something of a floor under house prices. Without these artificial props, prices would have likely continued to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where would prices go if these props were removed? Given the current conditions in the real-estate market, with bloated inventories, 9.8% unemployment, a dysfunctional mortgage industry and shattered illusions of real-estate riches, does it makes sense that prices should simply fall back to the trend line? I would argue that they should overshoot on the downside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a bleak economic prospect stretching far out into the future, I feel that a 10% dip below the 100-year trend line is a reasonable expectation within the next five years, particularly if mortgage rates rise to more typical levels of 6%. That would put the index at 114.02, or prices 28.3% below where we are now. Even a 5% dip would put us at 120.36, or 24.32% below current prices. If rates stay low, price dips may be less severe, but inflation will be higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From my perspective, homes are still overvalued not just because of these long-term price trends, but from a sober analysis of the current economy. The country is overly indebted, savings-depleted and underemployed. Without government guarantees no private lenders would be active in the mortgage market, and without ridiculously low interest rates from the Federal Reserve any available credit would cost home buyers much more. These are not conditions that inspire confidence for a recovery in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In trying to maintain artificial prices, government policies are keeping new buyers from entering the market, exposing taxpayers to untold trillions in liabilities and delaying a real recovery. We should recognize this reality and not pin our hopes on a return to price normalcy that never was that normal to begin with.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial claims for unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level in more than two years, offering another hopeful sign that the job market is improving as the economy regains some momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New claims fell 34,000 to a seasonally adjusted 388,000, the lowest since July 2008, the Labor Department said Thursday. The four-week moving average for claims, a measure used to smooth volatility in the weekly data, fell to 414,000 from 426,500. New filings have been hovering below 450,000 a week since the beginning of November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measure is closely watched because it gives one of the earliest indications of how many people are losing jobs. But the latest drop may have been exaggerated by Christmas week, which complicates how claims are counted. New claims fell sharply around the same time the past two years and then moved higher in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the report was seen as encouraging. "While the degree of decline may be overstated because of the seasonal issues, the trend is pretty clear," said John Silvia, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>. "That gives me a lot of hope and expectation for better job growth going forward." He expects the economy to add about 160,000 jobs a month on average in 2011, compared with about 90,000 a month in 2010. But at that pace, it would still take years to replace the 8.4 million jobs lost after the recession started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department reports next Friday on the number of jobs added and the unemployment rate in December. That report is based on a survey taken in mid-December. In the wake of a surprisingly weak report for November—only 39,000 jobs added—analysts are expecting significantly more than 100,000 jobs were added in December, though their predictions often prove far from the actual tally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other gauges of the employment market are turning positive, suggesting that a gradually accelerating economic expansion could translate into sustainable job growth in coming months. Surveys of purchasing managers show continued employment gains in the manufacturing and service sectors. Confidence among business executives from large and small companies is also moving higher, a key ingredient for stronger hiring. A recent survey by the Business Roundtable showed that almost half the chief executives in the group, which represents large corporations, plan to increase their U.S. employment in the next six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stronger growth in the labor market would provide critical support for areas of the economy that are already recovering, such as retail sales, and help struggling sectors like housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said Thursday that its index of pending home sales gained 3.5% in November, indicating stronger sales of existing homes to close out the year. The measure uses contract signings to forecast sales of existing homes in the next two months. It stood about 5% below its level from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector remains under pressure from high inventories and a coming wave of foreclosures, which are expected to keep the supply of homes for sale high and push prices lower. But the latest gain in the index suggests sales activity is picking up, albeit from very low levels, after months of declines following the April 30 expiration of a tax credit for home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're headed in the right direction," said <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> economist Daniel Silver. "We saw a steep drop-off, then we saw it bottom out, and we've seen growth in recent months."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many forecasters expect home prices, which have restarted declines in recent months, to remain under pressure for much of next year. While presenting problems for some homeowners and the investors who own their mortgages, price declines could help draw some buyers from the sidelines into the market.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Home Prices Are Still Too High; They would have to decline another 20% just to get back to the historical trend line.</span>
</div><div class="author">By Peter D. Schiff  </div><div>934 words</div><div>30 December 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most economists concede that a lasting general recovery is unlikely without a recovery in the housing market. A marked increase in defaults and foreclosures from today's already elevated levels could produce losses that overwhelm banks and trigger another, deeper financial crisis. Study after study has shown that defaults go up when falling prices put mortgage holders "underwater." As a result, the trajectory of home prices has tremendous economic significance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year market observers breathed easier when national prices stabilized. But the "robo-signing"-induced slowdown in the foreclosure market, the recent upward spike in home mortgage rates, and third quarter 2010 declines in the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case–Shiller home-price index—including very bad October numbers reported this week—have sparked concerns that a "double dip" in home prices is probable. A longer-term view of home price trends should sharply magnify this fear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even those economists worried about renewed price dips would be unlikely to believe that the vicious contractions of 2007 and 2008 (where prices fell about 30% nationally in just two years) could return. But they underestimate how distorted the market had become and how little it has since normalized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By all accounts, the home price boom that began in January 1998, when the previous 1989 peak was finally surpassed, and topped out in June 2006 was extraordinary. The 173% gain in the Case-Shiller 10-City Index (the only monthly data metric that predates the year 2000) in those nine years averaged an eye-popping 19.2% per year. As we know now, those gains had very little to do with market fundamentals, and everything to do with distortionary government policies that set off a national mania for real-estate wealth and a torrent of temporarily easy credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we assume the bubble was artificial, we can instead imagine that home prices should have followed a more traditional path during that time. In stock-market terms, prices should have followed a trend line. When you do these extrapolations (see lower line in the nearby chart), a sobering picture emerges. In his book "Irrational Exuberance," Yale economist Robert Shiller (co-creator of the Case-Shiller indices along with economists Karl Case and Allan Weiss), determined that in the 100 years between 1900 and 2000, home prices in the U.S. increased an average 3.35% per year, just a tad above the average rate of inflation. This period includes the Great Depression when home prices sank significantly, but it also includes the frothy postwar years of the 1950s and '60s, as well as the strong market of the early-to-mid 1980s, and the surge in the late '90s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January 1998 the 10-City Index was at 82.7. If home prices had followed the 3.35% annual 100 year trend line, then the index would have arrived at 126.7 in October 2010. This week, Case-Shiller announced that figure to be 159.0. This would suggest that the index would need to decline an additional 20.3% from current levels just to get back to the trend line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How has the market found the strength to stop its descent? No one is making the case that fundamentals have improved. Instead, there is widespread agreement that government intervention stopped the free fall. The home buyer's tax credit, record low interest rates, government mortgage-assistance programs, and the increased presence of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and the Federal Housing Administration in the mortgage-buying business have, for now, put something of a floor under house prices. Without these artificial props, prices would have likely continued to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where would prices go if these props were removed? Given the current conditions in the real-estate market, with bloated inventories, 9.8% unemployment, a dysfunctional mortgage industry and shattered illusions of real-estate riches, does it makes sense that prices should simply fall back to the trend line? I would argue that they should overshoot on the downside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a bleak economic prospect stretching far out into the future, I feel that a 10% dip below the 100-year trend line is a reasonable expectation within the next five years, particularly if mortgage rates rise to more typical levels of 6%. That would put the index at 114.02, or prices 28.3% below where we are now. Even a 5% dip would put us at 120.36, or 24.32% below current prices. If rates stay low, price dips may be less severe, but inflation will be higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From my perspective, homes are still overvalued not just because of these long-term price trends, but from a sober analysis of the current economy. The country is overly indebted, savings-depleted and underemployed. Without government guarantees no private lenders would be active in the mortgage market, and without ridiculously low interest rates from the Federal Reserve any available credit would cost home buyers much more. These are not conditions that inspire confidence for a recovery in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In trying to maintain artificial prices, government policies are keeping new buyers from entering the market, exposing taxpayers to untold trillions in liabilities and delaying a real recovery. We should recognize this reality and not pin our hopes on a return to price normalcy that never was that normal to begin with.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With construction projects stalled throughout the region, developer George Filopoulos is hoping a vote by the New Jersey Senate next month will help him continue his high-profile redevelopment of the old Jersey City Medical Center into a 14-acre mixed-use complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A proposed bill would allow New Jersey to join 31 other states in providing property-tax incentives to developers working on historic buildings. The New Jersey proposal has been approved by the Assembly and backers say it's expected to pass the Senate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If signed by Gov. Chris Christie, the conversion of the 10-building medical complex built mostly in the 1930s could qualify for as much as $87 million in tax credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Especially today, anything we can do to reduce the amount we have to borrow from the bank is essential," says Mr. Filopoulos, the Jersey City developer who has been working on the project since 2003. He has already converted two of the buildings to luxury apartments and built 45,000 square feet of amenities, including a pool and fitness center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next five years, he hopes to add an additional 1,000 units at the sprawling development that he has named the Beacon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Filopoulos's company, Metrovest Equities, also awaits a separate $15 million tax credit for the Beacon from the federal government that has been tied up for months in Congress. Designed to stimulate development in underserved communities, that tax-credit program was renewed as part of the 11th-hour tax deal struck with Congress by President Barack Obama earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Filopoulos's financing plans underscore the key role the public sector is playing these days in private construction projects. With the economy and banking system still under stress, conventional sources of construction financing are scarce. Other projects under way, such as the basketball arena at Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn and office buildings at the World Trade Center, have some form of public support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market has been horrendous and folks are turning to government agencies for help," says Robert Antonicello, executive director of the Jersey City Redevelopment Agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Filopoulos, who got into real estate after dropping out of college, has made numerous midcourse corrections to the Beacon development as both the financing climate and market have changed. At the peak of the market, he was able to pre-sell condos even before they were finished. During the dark days of the downturn, he was auctioning off units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's all about keeping things moving, no matter what the market hands you," Mr. Filopoulos says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The medical center, the largest Art Deco complex in New Jersey, was built between 1928 and 1941. Because of the high costs of operating the aging facility, most of it was closed in 1988. A new hospital opened nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2003, the city's Redevelopment Agency selected Mr. Filopoulos to develop the old hospital into a residential complex. Mr. Filopoulos, who hit his stride as a developer redeveloping troubled properties in the 1990s, envisioned a $350 million project with about 1,200 apartments, 100,000 square feet of commercial space and numerous amenities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially plenty of private financing was available as well as federal tax credits for historical restoration. Mr. Filopoulos took control of the land from the city and the county, paying them $9.5 million. He also obtained a $105 million loan from <span class="companylink">Fremont Investment &amp; Loan</span>, a California bank that later became ensnared in subprime mortgages and sold its real-estate business to <span class="companylink">iStar Financial Inc</span>. IStar currently is struggling with financial problems as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, it appeared Mr. Filopoulos might be able to stick to his original schedule and complete the entire project in five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, he finished the conversion of two of the buildings into condos, the Rialto and the Capital, and early sales were promising. The Beacon became the first condo building in Jersey City to sell a unit for more than $2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, Mr. Filopoulos began work on the next phase of his plan: a $30 million building initially planned for a 103-unit condo project, named the Mercury. (All the projects are named after old movie theaters.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after investment banking firm <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> collapsed in 2008, the world changed. Sales slowed from 30 to two a month, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Filopoulos also faced another problem: Under his deal with the state and city, he had to keep to a development schedule. Otherwise government officials could step in and take back the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To encourage sales, he conducted an auction in the spring of 2009 to sell 25 condos. Opening bids ranged from $150,000 to $250,000, down from original prices of$380,000 to $700,000. Today the two projects are 96% sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I had two choices: halt the project or quickly adapt to a new real estate reality," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, he changed the plan for the third building which was under construction. Instead of 103 mid-priced condo units, he converted it into 29 large, luxury lofts. "I figured it would be a hell of a lot cheaper and easier to sell 29 apartments than 103," Mr. Filopoulos says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the third building, where 3,000- to 6,000-square-feet luxury lofts are priced from $925,000 to $2 million, Mr. Filopoulos is working with buyers to customize the units, including one buyer who wants his unit to include a basketball court. Currently it has seven contracts out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These are priced to sell, I'm ready to get my money back," Mr. Filopoulos says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Money from the hoped-for state tax credits would go to the next building Mr. Filopoulos is planning, a $45 million, 190-unit rental building called the Paramount where rents will range between $1,400 and $2,700.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK—The dollar couldn't sustain its early momentum after a batch of strong economic reports and slipped to a seven-week low against the yen and a record low against the Swiss franc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar briefly pushed higher against the yen after upbeat economic readings on manufacturing, home sales and unemployment claims, but couldn't hold onto the modest gains. It ended up falling for the seventh time in the past eight days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slumping U.S. Treasury yields following a couple of strong bond auctions earlier in the week and Japanese companies selling dollars ahead of the end of the quarter had been hurting the dollar recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John McCarthy, manager of currency trading at ING Capital Markets, said many traders didn't want to end the year holding dollars, which has added to the greenback's weakness. Traders are still not certain about the pace of U.S. growth for 2011, even though recent indicators point toward the nation's economy picking up steam heading into the new year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders eventually brushed aside some promising signs of growth Thursday to send the dollar lower. The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index jumped in December, echoing strength seen in other regional manufacturing surveys. Pending home sales also rose by more than expected in November. Weekly claims for unemployment benefits fell to their lowest level since July 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A stronger economy could help push Treasury yields back up, making the dollar a more attractive investment option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late-afternoon trade, the dollar fetched 81.56 yen from 81.64 yen late Wednesday. It started the day by falling to a low of 81.28 yen before the brief spike higher following the economic reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar fell to a record low of 0.9351 Swiss franc before rising to 0.9359 franc in late trading. The euro also fell to a record low against the Swiss franc. The common currency dropped as low as 1.2398 francs early Thursday before rising back to 1.2430 francs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The franc has been regularly hitting record highs against the dollar and euro in recent weeks as investors flock to it for its safe-haven qualities. The Swiss economy has also held up well, analysts said, making it a good alternative to more uncertain economies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro continued to rally against the dollar as well, rising to $1.3286, from $1.3220 Wednesday. It occasionally climbed above $1.3300 through the day, its highest level in two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said the euro was helped by some year-end short covering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.K. pound was at $1.5412 late Thursday, down from $1.5497. The ICE Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. dollar against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, dropped to 79.522 from 79.796.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Light volume during the holiday markets continued to make moves erratic and added to volatility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tyson Wright, senior position trader at <span class="companylink">Western Union</span> Business Solutions, put liquidity at 30% to 50% of normal. It might be even less liquid at the end of this year compared with 2009 because the financial crisis has calmed for the most part, he said. That means the volatile conditions that had driven traders and hedge-fund managers to open or close positions at the end of the year have subsided, Mr. Wright said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the ICE Dollar Index weakening, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>'s PowerShares U.S. Dollar Index Bearish exchange-traded fund rose 0.29% Thursday, while its PowerShares U.S. Dollar Index Bullish fund fell 0.35%. The two exchange-traded funds are based on <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> currency-futures indexes, whose composition mirrors that of the ICE's Dollar Index.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners think in three dimensions: location, location, location. But there is a fourth: timing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite Tuesday's dismal S&amp;P Case-Shiller house-price data, for the three months to October, the suffering isn't universal. For example, prices in Washington, D.C., are down 25.7% since their May 2006 peak but are up almost 4% in the year to October. Las Vegas has suffered the biggest decline from its peak, down 57%. The worst performer on a 12-month basis, though, is Chicago, off 6.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keep an eye on Phoenix. Until early 2009, it vied with Vegas for the country's biggest drop from peak prices. It is now the second-worst, down 53.4%. However, while Vegas appears to have stabilized, Phoenix's 12-month trend has deteriorated from a gain of 7.2% in May's index to a decline of 4.3% in the latest. Phoenix's struggle to rise from the ashes isn't over yet.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A pick-up in consumer spending, healthy economic growth and falling unemployment resulting in modest stock gains -- that's what prominent economists predicted a year ago for 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They had good reason. At the time, shoppers were slowly returning to stores. The unemployment rate was an alarming 10% but had fallen from an October peak of 10.1%. The gross domestic product surged in the fourth quarter of 2009 at an annualized rate of 5%. And history was on their side. Economic recoveries in 1983, 1994 and 2003 followed a pattern whereby spending begot zippy economic growth, and with it new jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this recovery has been anything but normal. U.S. stocks have returned a generous 15% this year, but shopping has picked up only a little (consumer spending is up 3%, just half a percentage point over 2009's gains). Recent economic growth -- an annualized 2.6% last quarter -- is at least half what was typical of past recoveries. The jobless rate remains high at 9.8%, even as the profits and cash stockpiles of corporations hit record levels during the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The persistently high unemployment rate raises fears that up to three million jobs in areas like manufacturing, construction and retail might never return, says Edward Leamer, director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast for economics. Missed 2010 forecasts and murky 2011 ones among experts could also be a sign that models are due for a change. "Most modeling has a one-size-fits-all attitude toward the economy," says Leamer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are seven predictions where leading experts fell short in 2010 and their take on what's to come in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next: Economic growth[http://www.smartmoney.com/investing/economy/2010-financial-and-economic-predictions-gone-wrong-1293085697172/?page=2]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic Growth</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expert: Dean Maki, chief U.S. economist, Barclay's Capital</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prediction: Maki predicted GDP would expand at a pace of 3.5% on an annualized basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why: During the last quarter of 2009, GDP grew at 5%, similar to growth patterns after prior recessions. And economists had forecast an uptick in household spending and the worry of unemployment rates rocketing well over 10% had begun to ease. Typically, such factors play into continued GDP expansion and other economic indicators in late 2009 also pointed to a strong growth rate, says Maki.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What really happened and why: The inflation-adjusted GDP grew at an annualized rate of 2.6% through the third quarter of 2010; most analysts now expect the final 2010 GDP growth rate to be between 2.7% and 2.8%. The higher GDP growth Maki forecast didn't materialize partly because of several surprises in 2010, he says. Surging imports and declining exports led to "the largest drag on the economy from trade in more than 60 years," Maki says. What's more, productivity posted surprisingly large gains and "consumers [were] more cautious than we'd previously thought," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Maki expects in 2011: He sees a "solid year" and predicts that the GDP will grow 3.1%. Maki sees consumer spending, pushed up by higher personal incomes and the lessening of housing woes, increasing by about 3.1%. He also believes that business investment spending, spurred by higher corporate earnings, will rise -- including a 14.8% jump in equipment and software spending and a 5.7% increase in spending on structures. Both will contribute to continued expansion of GDP, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next: Housing[http://www.smartmoney.com/investing/economy/2010-financial-and-economic-predictions-gone-wrong-1293085697172/?page=3]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expert: Robert Shiller, professor of economics at Yale University and co-developer of the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prediction: In December 2009, Shiller said, "I think that there is a likely scenario of a double dip in home prices." He believed that home prices would take a big fall again and that prices would stay in a "state of uncertainty" for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why: Shiller expected home sales to drop after the tax credit expired because he thought fewer consumers would be interested in buying a home once the free money disappeared. With fewer buyers and more homes on the market, home prices would decline once again. Shiller and his colleague, Dr. Karl Case, also expected home prices to sink after homeowners' adjustable-rate mortgages reset to higher rates; millions of loans were set to do so this year. That would have a domino effect: Fewer people would be able to afford bigger monthly payments and short sales and foreclosures would rise, sending home prices down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What really happened: So far, that forecast double dip has been a small one. After home prices rose 4.7% between the first and second quarters of the year, they fell 2% in the third quarter, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index. Rates on ARMs (and mortgages in general) fell to historic lows this year, in part because of the weak economy and a rush to the bond market. Adjusted rates on ARMS were actually lower than what borrowers were paying before. And with about 11 million homes underwater this year, more homeowners who had planned to sell have decided against putting homes on the market to avoid selling it at a low price, says Shiller. That's helped control the inventory for sale, which has kept home prices stronger than they otherwise would have been. And existing homes sales actually rose three of the last four months, which has helped stabilize prices (They're up 0.4% in November, year-over-year).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Shiller expects in 2011: Shiller says he's no longer making forecasts. "I used to forecast home prices with some success because they would go in the same direction [for years], but there's been strange behavior since spring 2009," he says. Still, he doesn't believe home prices will fall at the same rates they did between 2006 and 2009. That said, Shiller says it's possible prices will fall another 5% between the third quarter of 2010 and third quarter of 2011. The Federal Reserve's second round of quantitative easing, which is designed to keep interest rates low, should help boost home sales and keep prices more stable, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next: Food Prices[http://www.smartmoney.com/investing/economy/2010-financial-and-economic-predictions-gone-wrong-1293085697172/?page=4]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Food Prices</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expert: Ephraim Leibtag, senior economist at the Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prediction: In December 2009, Leibtag, who is also the USDA's food price forecaster, projected a 3% to 4% increase in food prices in 2010 because of rising consumer demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why: Leibtag says the USDA expected higher consumer demand at grocery stores and in restaurants and also expected growing demand for food in general from developing countries. And with more corn and soybeans being used to make ethanol and biodiesel to power cars, the USDA projected prices would also continue to rise because of greater demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What really happened: Food prices are up 0.5% to 1.5% -- the lowest annual food inflation rate since 1992, according to the USDA Economic Research Service. The global spread of the economic slump led to weak consumer demand in the U.S. and abroad for American-grown staples like corn, wheat and soybeans. That actually led to a decline in food prices during the first two months of 2010. Consumer demand didn't move much in early 2010, so prices barely budged until September when they rose above the 1% mark and have remained steady since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Leibtag expects in 2011: He predicts an increase of 2% to 3% in food prices as consumer demand picks up slowly but steadily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next: Small Businesses[http://www.smartmoney.com/investing/economy/2010-financial-and-economic-predictions-gone-wrong-1293085697172/?page=5]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small Business</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expert: Bill Dunkelberg, chief economist at the National Federation of Independent Business</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prediction: In October 2009, Dunkelberg said that as economic recovery seems more assured, small companies would want to borrow to beef up inventories and buy new equipment -- and that banks will be ready to help them then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why: The NFIB was expecting a recovery much like those that followed previous recessions when gross domestic product averaged 8% the year after the official end of a recession. Based on that projection, NFIB forecasted that small businesses would see an increase in consumer demand, followed by rising sales that would create incentives to borrow more money from banks to buy new equipments. And NFIB believed those same factors would prompt banks to open the lending spigot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What really happened: The recession officially ended in June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. But GDP didn't even crack 2% a year later. The slow recovery has meant lack of consumer demand, leaving little reason for small businesses to consider expansions. And while banks have increased lending this year somewhat, there are fewer small businesses who want to borrow. More than 50% of NFIB's members, made up of around 420,000 small businesses, say they're not interested in taking out loans, the highest number in 27 years. "You don't buy a new delivery truck if there are no new customers to deliver to," says Dunkelberg. Business owners who are looking for a loan need that money simply to stay afloat, but banks aren't giving loans to businesses with iffy balance sheets, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Dunkelberg expects in 2011: Small business inventory is starting to dwindle and as consumer spending picks up further – it's currently up 3% this year – more companies will look for ways to expand slowly, possibly buying equipment or hiring more people, predicts Dunkelberg on behalf of the NFIB. Still, because he expects the growth to be slow, he predicts small businesses won't get back to where they were on the loan front or the growth curve pre-recession even a year from now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next: Deflation and Inflation[http://www.smartmoney.com/investing/economy/2010-financial-and-economic-predictions-gone-wrong-1293085697172/?page=6]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deflation and Inflation</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expert: Roubini Global Economics, chairman Nouriel Roubini, a.k.a. "Dr. Doom"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prediction: In January, Roubini and his company RGE forecast a deflationary risk in part from falling demand for goods and a disinflationary trend in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why: Roubini and his company expected consumer spending to decline in 2010 and believed there would be an excess supply of labor and excess capacity in the manufacturing sector, says Prajakta Bhide, a research analyst at RGE (Roubini was unavailable for comment for this story). "Those three factors combined are deflationary," she says. What's more, U.S. consumers were scaling back on new debts, partly because of the wealth they lost when home values plummeted, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What really happened and why: After two years of holding back, pent-up consumer demand gave way to purchases – especially for those who held on to their jobs through the recession and felt confident to spend again. By November, when the Federal Reserve rolled out a second round of quantitative easing, it further reduced the chances of deflation, says Bhide, since QE2 is mostly designed to boost aggregate demand by keeping borrowing costs low. The result has been overall inflation of 1% year-to-date on a seasonally adjusted annual rate, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and core inflation (which excludes food and energy) of 0.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What RGE expects next year: RGE expects overall inflation of around 1.4% in 2011 and core inflation of 1%. "Consumer spending [will] pick up more than we initially expected because of the payroll tax cut," which will leave people with more disposable income, says Bhide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next: Gold[http://www.smartmoney.com/investing/economy/2010-financial-and-economic-predictions-gone-wrong-1293085697172/?page=7]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expert: Peter Schiff, president and chief global strategist of Euro Pacific Capital</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prediction: In early December 2009, when gold hit then-record-high prices above $1,200 an ounce, Schiff said that current gold prices were "not expensive" and that the prices would rise steadily in 2010 and for years after, eventually reaching $5,000 an ounce — possibly by the end of 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why: Schiff believed 2010 would bring sustained economic weakness, a buckling of the dollar and more quantitative easing — all of which would push gold prices higher as uneasy investors looked to hedge against currency devaluation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What really happened and why: The price per ounce for gold has climbed more than 26% this year, hitting a record high of $1,431.25 an ounce on Dec. 7, and recently settling at about $1,380 an ounce. Demand for gold has been spurred by the debt crisis in Europe and the quantitative easing in the U.S., both of which harmed currencies. Gold is one of a number of commodities whose prices are on the rise: Silver is up more than 72%, coffee more than 65% and light crude oil about 21% — all as of Dec. 23.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Schiff expects in 2011: "Gold will go a lot higher," he says. "It will outperform the U.S. stock market." Schiff expects more of the same economic issues, as weakening currencies around the globe, a slow-to-recover economy and continued quantitative easing encourage investors to go for gold. He still sees gold reaching $5,000 per ounce "over the next three to five years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next: Unemployment[http://www.smartmoney.com/investing/economy/2010-financial-and-economic-predictions-gone-wrong-1293085697172/?page=8]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unemployment</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expert: David Wyss, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prediction: Near the end of 2009, Wyss said he believed unemployment would peak at about 10.4% in the second quarter of 2010 and then begin to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why: Wyss believed that steady economic growth -- he forecast that GDP would grow at an annual rate of 2.4% -- would spur job growth in mid-to-late 2010, leading to more hiring and a reduction in the unemployment rate. He projected the rate would top out at 10.4% because employment, a lagging indicator, usually takes months to begin growing even after the economy as a whole has improved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What really happened and why: GDP has grown much as Wyss predicted (the revised third-quarter GDP released this week is 2.6% on an annualized basis), but the unemployment rate has remained stubbornly high and relatively stable, hovering between 9.5% and 9.9% in 2010. High rates of productivity, which Wyss had not expected, led to lower-than-expected employment growth, he says. "Productivity has been stronger throughout the recession than normal, in part because so much of the recession is concentrated in the low-productivity construction sector and in part because employers substituted equipment for workers in order to be competitive," he says. Add to that older workers who have delayed retirement and held on to their jobs and the result has been few job openings. Job creation has also remained stagnant after job losses continued through much of the year. And just 842,000 non-farm jobs were added to payrolls across the country, according to the Labor Department -- not nearly enough to make up for the more than eight million jobs lost during the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What to expect in 2011: More of the same, he says. "We expect unemployment to average 9.5% for the year and close at about 9.25%," with most of that small decline happening in the second half of the year, he says. Wyss partly attributes these stagnant employment predictions to a "more cautious consumer" and stagnant demand, leading to less need to hire new workers. However, Wyss predicts the health-care sector will add between 40,000 and 50,000 jobs per month and that job creation in the lower-paying personal service sector — work in child care, fitness instruction, hair care and the like — will also grow, though at a slower rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next: The Stock Market[http://www.smartmoney.com/investing/economy/2010-financial-and-economic-predictions-gone-wrong-1293085697172/?page=9]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stock Market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expert: Harry Dent, founder and CEO of economic think tank HS Dent, author of "The Great Depression Ahead"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prediction: In the summer of 2009, Dent said he believed that the U.S. was headed into a deeper recession and that stock prices would plummet throughout 2010 and 2011, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average bottoming out somewhere between 7,200 and 3,800 in mid-2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why: Dent believed that the effects of the stimulus on the economy would wane, slowing economic growth. He also thought that baby boomers – important because of their sheer numbers and high incomes – would cut spending, further depressing the housing and retail markets. All of it would send the stock market reeling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What really happened and why: Major indexes rose this year with the S&amp;P 500 up about 13% year-to-date, Nasdaq up about 18% and the Dow rising about 11% (on Dec. 22, the Dow closed at 11,559). The markets were bolstered by reports of steady economic growth, solid corporate earnings and higher retail sales and consumer spending, among other factors. Major issues like the European debt crisis and a weak employment situation haven't left a lasting bruise thus far. Dent says the market decline he predicted didn't happen in 2010 because the effects of the stimulus lasted longer than expected and because the bond market has been slow to react to the threat of the mounting deficit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What to expect in 2011: Dent still foresees the major market crash. "The markets will go up into March 2011 or so, but will then start to correct themselves," he says. The reason: "Deficit fears will play a big role." The U.S. government is trillions of dollars in debt and is facing high costs associated with an aging population — the first boomers turn 65 next year — who will soon demand Social Security and other benefits. Add to that reduced revenue as a result of tax cuts and Dent expects bond yields will rise and push stocks down, he says. He still believes "the Dow could hit 5000," in the next few years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasurys posted a loss for the holiday-shortened week after some encouraging economic reports and as market participants readied for next week's final government note auctions of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's trading ended the week, as financial markets are closed Friday for Christmas Eve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices fell after a series of economic reports offered hope the economy will continue to recover heading into 2011. Weekly jobless claims fell more than expected, new home sales rose in November, and consumer sentiment pushed up in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late in New York, the two-year note was off 2/32 point, or 62.5 cents for each $1,000 invested, to 99 22/32, to yield 0.663%, up from 0.630% late Wednesday, as prices and yields move inversely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year fell 13/32 point, or $4.0625 for each $1,000 invested, to 93 19/32, to yield 3.392%, from 3.342% late Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Losses left the bond market in better shape heading into the coming week's Treasury auctions, as lower prices could help lure more buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market participants prepared for the sales by driving prices down in order to get a better price at the auctions, known as building in a concession. Some say the auctions could draw somewhat lackluster demand as trading desks typically are thinly staffed in the year's final week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each of the past six late-December two-year auctions have tailed, noted David Ader, head of government bond strategy at CRT Capital Group, meaning that the yield on the new notes was higher than that on the when-issued notes just before the sale.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keith F. Barket 1961-2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keith F. Barket, the global head of <span class="companylink">Angelo, Gordon &amp; Co</span>.'s real-estate group, came from a family of property investors and was quick to recognize the bargains that abounded in the wake of the early 1990s recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Angelo Gordon</span> was his partner on many of those deals. One day, the investment firm called him up and offered him a job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He truly had it all -- an analyst, a mentor and a leader," said John Angelo, co-founder and chief executive of the New York-based firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barket, who died Wednesday at age 49 of peritoneal mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer of the abdominal lining, vaulted <span class="companylink">Angelo Gordon</span>, one of the world's largest hedge-fund firms, into the top league of private-equity real-estate investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Angelo Gordon</span> now has more than 50 professionals working in its real-estate department. During the past 17 years, the firm has invested more than $5 billion of equity in about 300 deals, and Mr. Barket has helped it build a major presence in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A St. Louis native, he was known for his sanguine personality and down-to-earth manners in real-estate and private-equity circles. "You always knew where you stood with him," said hotelier Ian Schrager. "It's a breath of fresh air in our business."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the more recent real-estate downturn, many fund managers and property developers have been struggling with heavily indebted deals made at the top of the market. But Mr. Barket's team emerged relatively unscathed and has become an active buyer of distressed real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past 18 months, <span class="companylink">Angelo Gordon</span> has invested more than $1 billion of equity in about 50 deals, including the high-profile purchase of the Helmsley Carlton House hotel and apartment building in Manhattan.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keith F. Barket, the global head of <span class="companylink">Angelo, Gordon &amp; Co</span>.'s real-estate group, came from a family of property investors and was quick to recognize the bargains that abounded in the wake of the early 1990s recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Angelo Gordon</span> was his partner on many of those deals. One day, the investment firm called him up and offered him a job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He truly had it all—an analyst, a mentor and a leader," said John Angelo, co-founder and chief executive of the New York-based firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barket, who died Wednesday at age 49 of peritoneal mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer of the abdominal lining, vaulted <span class="companylink">Angelo Gordon</span>, one of the world's largest hedge-fund firms, into the top league of private-equity real-estate investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Angelo Gordon</span> now has more than 50 professionals working in its real-estate department. During the past 17 years, the firm has invested more than $5 billion of equity in about 300 deals, and Mr. Barket has helped it build a major presence in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A St. Louis native, he was known for his sanguine personality and down-to-earth manners in real-estate and private-equity circles. "You always knew where you stood with him," said prominent hotelier Ian Schrager. "It's a breath of fresh air in our business."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the more recent real-estate downturn, many fund managers and property developers have been struggling with heavily indebted deals made at the top of the market. But Mr. Barket's team emerged relatively unscathed and has become an active buyer of distressed real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past 18 months, <span class="companylink">Angelo Gordon</span> has invested more than $1 billion of equity in about 50 deals, including the high-profile purchase of the Helmsley Carlton House hotel and apartment building in Manhattan. In addition, the firm is one of the few private-equity fund managers that has successfully raised money. It recently closed a $625 million fund to invest in Asia's property markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Mr. Barket's father and brother have been active in real-estate investment. A graduate of Georgetown University, he got his M.B.A. from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and was active during the 1990s doing deals with the <span class="companylink">Resolution Trust Corp</span>., the government agency set up to liquidate assets, mostly real estate, seized from failed thrifts.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty </div><div>497 words</div><div>23 December 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy grew slightly faster than the government previously estimated in the third quarter, and forecasters have been raising growth projections for the fourth quarter and for 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Optimism about the U.S. recovery has grown sharply in the past month, fueled by a series of economic reports showing everything from consumers spending more freely to businesses curbing layoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's gross domestic product, a broad measure of goods and services produced by the economy, rose 2.6% in the third quarter, compared with the 2.5% growth the government previously estimated, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. This followed 1.7% growth in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report showed exports were strong and businesses spent more than previously thought on restocking shelves in the third quarter. That could indicate they expect stronger sales ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, consumer spending was lower in the period than the government previously estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy has shown signs of accelerating during the fourth quarter, and economists are predicting a strong holiday shopping season. The revival of consumer spending is also expected to continue next year, thanks in part to the large package of federal tax cuts signed into law earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sunnier outlook has led many economists to boost U.S. growth estimates for the fourth quarter and for 2011. Over recent weeks, eight banks and private economic-research firms surveyed by The Wall Street Journal, including <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>., <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Macroeconomic Advisers</span>, have raised their growth estimates for the last three months of the year to an average of 3.5% from 2.6% earlier in the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Bottom line: People are less scared about a double dip," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at forecasting firm IHS Global Insight. Mr. Behravesh's firm recently increased its fourth-quarter forecast to 3.5% from 3.0% earlier in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the National Association of Realtors on Wednesday reported that U.S. sales of existing homes rose 5.6% in November from a month earlier, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.68 million units. Sales of used homes represent more than 90% of house sales in the U.S. The average price for an existing home was up for the first time since August, to $170,600 in November. That was an increase of 0.4% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is still extremely weak, despite the steadily improving outlook elsewhere in the economy. There is a huge stock of unsold homes, and roughly a third of existing homes sold were under some sort of financial stress, either in the form of foreclosure or homes sold for less than the owner owed the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of previously owned homes listed for sale fell 4.0% at the end of November to 3.71 million units.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Treasury Prices Fall for Week; Auctions Ahead</span>
</div><div class="author">By Deborah Lynn Blumberg   </div><div>524 words</div><div>23 December 2010</div><div>17:38</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasurys posted a loss for the holiday-shortened week after some encouraging economic reports and as market participants readied for next week's final government note auctions of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's trading ended the week, as financial markets are closed Friday for Christmas Eve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices fell after a series of economic reports offered hope the economy will continue to recover heading into 2011. Weekly jobless claims fell more than expected, new home sales rose in November, and consumer sentiment pushed up in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late in New York, the two-year note was off 2/32 point, or 62.5 cents for each $1,000 invested, to 99 22/32, to yield 0.663%, up from 0.630% late Wednesday, as prices and yields move inversely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year fell 13/32 point, or $4.0625 for each $1,000 invested, to 93 19/32, to yield 3.392%, from 3.342% late Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Losses left the bond market in better shape heading into the coming week's Treasury auctions, as lower prices could help lure more buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market participants prepared for the sales by driving prices down in order to get a better price at the auctions, known as building in a concession. Some say the auctions could draw somewhat lackluster demand as trading desks typically are thinly staffed in the year's final week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each of the past six late-December two-year auctions have tailed, noted David Ader, head of government bond strategy at CRT Capital Group, meaning that the yield on the new notes was higher than that on the when-issued notes just before the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury Sets Sales</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury will sell $156 billion in bills and notes next week. Details of the offerings (all with minimum denominations of $100):</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Monday: $29 billion in three-month bills and $28 billion in six-month bills will be sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bills will be dated Dec. 30 and mature March 31, 2011, and June 30, 2011, respectively. The Cusip number for the three-month bills is 9127952J9 and for the six-month bills is 912795X22.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Noncompetitive tenders for the bills must be received by 11 a.m. EST Monday, and competitive tenders by 11:30 a.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Monday, $35 billion in two-year notes will be sold, dated Dec. 31, 2010, and maturing Dec. 31, 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cusip number is 912828PW4. Noncompetitive tenders must be received by noon Monday and competitive tenders by 1 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Tuesday: $35 billion in five-year notes will be sold, dated Dec. 31, 2010, and maturing Dec. 31, 2015. The Cusip number is 912828PM6. Noncompetitive tenders must be received by noon Tuesday, and competitive tenders by 1 p.m. (Details on the usual four-week bill sale will be announced Tuesday.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Wednesday: $29 billion in seven-year notes will be sold, dated Dec. 31, 2010, and maturing Dec. 31, 2017. The Cusip number is 912828PN4. Noncompetitive tenders must be received by noon Wednesday, and competitive tenders by 1 p.m.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Barbara Kollmeyer   </div><div>609 words</div><div>23 December 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>23</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European stocks extended their winning streak to three sessions Wednesday, boosted by car firms and chip maker <span class="companylink">ARM Holdings</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Swiss franc continued flexing its muscle, hitting a record high against the euro as investors sought safety from the financial woes of some euro-zone governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stoxx Europe 600 index rose 0.1% to 281.45, its highest since September 2008. It is up 11.2% year to date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A positive [factor] that is lifting Europe is coming from the U.S. where forecasters are revising up their GDP forecasts and some of them are even going for 4% in 2011," said Stephen Pope, managing partner at Spotlight Ideas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. third-quarter gross domestic product was revised up slightly to 2.6% from a prior estimate of 2.5%, while data from the National Association of Realtors showed sales of existing U.S. homes rose 5.6% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the reports pointed to a still-recovering U.S. economy, bank stocks benefitted from recent merger activity, helping push stocks to two-year highs. In late trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 21.64 points, or 0.2%, at 11554.80. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2% at 2671.62and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index advanced 0.3% to 1258.36.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasurys prices dropped as the Federal Reserve completed its last debt purchase of the week, buying $2.5 billion in Treasurys maturing in the next 11 to 17 years. The benchmark 10-year note fell 5/32 in price to yield 3.342%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Autos supported the gains in Europe, as reflected in a 1.3% gain for Renault and a 0.5% rise for <span class="companylink">Volkswagen</span>. Mr. Pope pointed to a new Gallup survey that referred to optimism for 2011 in emerging markets, notably in Brazil, India and China. "As the middle classes expand, they will want more autos and better health care, so profit potential is being priced in," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 0.5% to 5983.49, supported by a 9.1% rally in <span class="companylink">ARM Holdings</span>. The Wall Street Journal said Microsoftwill announce a new version of its Windows operating system that runs on technology provided by ARM.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Paris, the CAC 40 indexended off 0.2% at 3919.71, but shares of <span class="companylink">LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton</span> rose 1.8%. Late Tuesday, the company said it was raising to 20% its stake in <span class="companylink">Hermes International</span>. Hermes gained 2.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Frankfurt, the DAX 30 index fell 0.1% to 7067.92. Infineon Technologies rose 1.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of stabilization in the struggling U.S. housing market helped the dollar gain against the euro. Late afternoon in New York, the euro was at $1.3088, down from $1.3096 late Tuesday. The euro fell as low as 1.2440 francs and the dollar fell to its lowest against the franc since its record low in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude-oil futures climbed 45 cents to $90.27 a barrel on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>, following a deeper-than-expected drop in crude-oil stockpiles last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comex gold futures fell $1.40, or 0.1%, to $1,386 an ounce as China's support for Europe's troubled debt markets tempered haven buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other major stock market action:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">British Airways</span> rose 1.9%, recovering some ground lost as harsh winter weather disrupted flights across Europe in recent days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Suez Environnement</span> in Paris and Severn Trent in London each rose 2.1% as utility stocks firmed.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Deal of the Week: Back to Basics for Tishman</span>
</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi   </div><div>757 words</div><div>22 December 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tishman Speyer Properties' purchase of a new Chicago office tower is the latest sign that the firm is going back to the basics as it emerges from one of the most devastating commercial real-estate cycles in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its purchase of 353 North Clark St. for $385 million, an estimated $55 million less than it cost to build, also exposes the fault lines as well as the opportunities for investors and owners as the market recovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tishman Speyer built its reputation in the office market. But during the boom years it played a leading role in the ill-fated acquisitions of multifamily company <span class="companylink">Archstone-Smith Trust</span> and Manhattan's Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village apartment complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those deals and a few others collapsed, tarnishing the firm's image. Now, as it puts its problems behind it, Tishman Speyer is cranking up its deal engine focusing on the types of acquisitions it knows best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides 353 North Clark, Tishman also announced this week that it bought a 327,000-square-foot office building along the Seine River in a suburb of Paris for about 100 million euros ($131 million). It also said it is buying back a majority stake in and regaining sole ownership of a three-building Silicon Valley office complex in California where <span class="companylink">Juniper Networks</span> has its headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These purchases make it clear that Tishman Speyer will continue to be a major player, despite its problems in recent years. Tishman Speyer, which has invested in more than $50 billion of property since 1978, owns more than 50 million square feet globally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, any losses the firm suffered were shared among investors. Principals Jerry Speyer and son Rob Speyer also put some of their own money into deals. But, like most successful developers, they attracted numerous individuals and institutions eager to invest alongside them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Speyers, who declined to comment, have said in the past that their firm has made more than 20% annual returns on investments since its inception three decades ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of these investors and others are sticking with Tishman Speyer. The firm has more than $2 billion available from its prerecession fund-raising efforts. It also has succeeded in raising fresh money, particularly to shore up some of its troubled office-building deals, like its purchase in 2006 of the CarrAmerica portfolio in Washington, D.C., from private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> in a deal valued at $2.8 billion</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As long as investment managers are honest and upfront about what went wrong, their investors tend to be understanding," said Greg MacKinnon, director of research for the Pension Real Estate Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of Tishman Speyer's property acquisitions globally has risen from about $99 million in 2009 to about $1.06 billion this year. The dollar volume of its sales also has increased from $500 million last year to about $1.9 billion this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chicago deal shows that there is plenty of opportunity out there. The developer of the 1.2-million-square-foot tower, a venture led by <span class="companylink">Mesirow Financial</span>, was under pressure from about $374 million in debt coming due last month, including a construction loan held by <span class="companylink">Hypo Real Estate Holding AG</span> and a mezzanine loan of about $44 million, according to a person familiar with the transaction. Mesirow, which was represented by <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> in the deal, declined to comment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building's annual net income of about $21 million represents about a 5.5% return on the purchase price. Tishman Speyer can boost that return because the building is only 79% leased.</p>

The River North submarket where the building is located has seen its vacancy rate rise to 18.1% from 8.2% in the fourth quarter of 2008 as it still is struggling to absorb new space, including some of the empty floors in 353 North Clark.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose less than expected last month, though prices stabilized as fewer houses remained on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for used homes increased by 5.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.68 million, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected home sales in November to increase by 6.5%, to an annual rate of 4.72 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the price for an existing home edged up for the first time since August, to $170,600 in November. That's up 0.4% from the year-ago median price of $170,000 and an improvement from a downwardly revised $170,400 in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A high level of unsold homes has contributed to the recent drop in prices. The inventory of previously owned homes listed for sale shrunk by 4.0% at the end of November to 3.71 million available for sale. That represented a 9.5-month supply at the current sales pace, compared with a 10.5-month supply in October. But a big supply of unlisted bank-owned homes and potential foreclosures loom on the horizon, a "shadow inventory" that could push down prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is a sore spot within the economy, which is growing slowly out of the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists predict the housing sector has a better chance of recovering when the job market improves. Rising unemployment has scared many consumers away from the market from buying a house. And while mortgage rates are low, some people have had difficulty getting a loan to make a purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A healthy level of home sales would be an annualized rate of just over 5 million home sales. The NAR predicts about 4.8 million homes will be sold this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the chief economist at NAR, said he expects sales to recover to around 5.2 million next year, which would be in line with "more sustainable levels" last seen in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that seasonal factors contributed to last month's inventory reduction, the number of homes on the market is expected to climb back up to around 4 million by spring, said Yun. Still, a sales rate of around 5.2 million should create a "stable home-value situation next year," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously occupied homes in October declined by an unrevised 2.2% to 4.43 million. For the past year, resales were down 27.9% since November 2009, when the government was providing tax credits to support the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new problem for the housing market emerged in the fall, with revelations that several banks made errors on court documents used to evict homeowners. Some buyers avoided foreclosures because of the document crisis, hurting sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures have climbed because Americans out of work couldn't keep up with payments on mortgages taken out during the housing boom. The NAR said distressed properties accounted for about a third of sales in November.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Back to Basics for Tishman</span>
</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi   </div><div>756 words</div><div>22 December 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tishman Speyer Properties' purchase of a new Chicago office tower is the latest sign that the firm is going back to the basics as it emerges from one of the most devastating commercial real-estate cycles in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its purchase of 353 North Clark St. for $385 million, an estimated $55 million less than it cost to build, also exposes the fault lines as well as the opportunities for investors and owners as the market recovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tishman Speyer built its reputation in the office market. But during the boom years it played a leading role in the ill-fated acquisitions of multifamily company <span class="companylink">Archstone-Smith Trust</span> and Manhattan's Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village apartment complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those deals and a few others collapsed, tarnishing the firm's image. Now, as it puts its problems behind it, Tishman Speyer is cranking up its deal engine focusing on the types of acquisitions it knows best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides 353 North Clark, Tishman also announced this week that it bought a 327,000-square-foot office building along the Seine River in a suburb of Paris for about €100 million ($131 million). It also said it is buying back a majority stake in and regaining sole ownership of a three-building Silicon Valley office complex in California where <span class="companylink">Juniper Networks</span> has its headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These purchases make it clear that Tishman Speyer will continue to be a major player, despite its problems in recent years. Tishman Speyer, which has invested in more than $50 billion of property since 1978, owns more than 50 million square feet globally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, any losses the firm suffered were shared among investors. Principals Jerry Speyer and son Rob Speyer also put some of their own money into deals. But, like most successful developers, they attracted numerous individuals and institutions eager to invest alongside them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Speyers, who declined to comment, have said in the past that their firm has made more than 20% annual returns on investments since its inception three decades ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of these investors and others are sticking with Tishman Speyer. The firm has more than $2 billion available from its prerecession fund-raising efforts. It also has succeeded in raising fresh money, particularly to shore up some of its troubled office-building deals, like its purchase in 2006 of the CarrAmerica portfolio in Washington, D.C., from private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> in a deal valued at $2.8 billion</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As long as investment managers are honest and upfront about what went wrong, their investors tend to be understanding," said Greg MacKinnon, director of research for the Pension Real Estate Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of Tishman Speyer's property acquisitions globally has risen from about $99 million in 2009 to about $1.06 billion this year. The dollar volume of its sales also has increased from $500 million last year to about $1.9 billion this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chicago deal shows that there is plenty of opportunity out there. The developer of the 1.2-million-square-foot tower, a venture led by <span class="companylink">Mesirow Financial</span>, was under pressure from about $374 million in debt coming due last month, including a construction loan held by <span class="companylink">Hypo Real Estate Holding AG</span> and a mezzanine loan of about $44 million, according to a person familiar with the transaction. Mesirow, which was represented by <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> in the deal, declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tishman Speyer also benefited from the return of the commercial mortgage-backed securities market as a debt financing source. It will provide about 50% to 60% of the purchase price in the 353 North Clark deal, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building's annual net income of about $21 million represents about a 5.5% return on the purchase price. Tishman Speyer can boost that return because the building is only 79% leased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are market risks, too. Chicago's office-vacancy rate rose to 16% in the third quarter from 15.5% in the year-earlier period, and average asking rents fell to $22.55 a square foot from $22.92, according to <span class="companylink">CoStar Group Inc</span>. The River North submarket where the building is located has seen its vacancy rate rise to 18.1% from 8.2% in the fourth quarter of 2008 as it still is struggling to absorb new space, including some of the empty floors in 353 North Clark.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has been a good year for values in New York's office building market. But the rising tide still hasn't been enough to save the deals that were launched at the top of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider losses suffered in two recent sales by British real-estate firm Rock New York, founded by Paul Kemsley, which bought two New York office buildings in 2007 and 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rock New York has sold the 255,000-square-foot, Class B office building, at 183 Madison Ave. at 34th Street, for $85 million, or $334 a square foot, to Rigby Asset Management's Peter Armstrong and Argentine firm IRSA's Daniel Elsztain. Mr. Kemsley bought the building in April 2007 for $107.5 million, or $422 a square foot. The recent sale was brokered by Woody Heller and Will Silverman of Studley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, Rock New York sold its other New York property, 100 Fifth Ave. to Kaufman Management and Invesco Real Estate for $93.5 million, or $346 a foot, also a loss. When it was purchased in February 2008, the price tag was $152 million, or $563 a foot.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New jobless claims fell again last week, providing the latest sign that the labor market may be picking up, while an uptick in housing starts offered a modest boost for a troubled sector of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial claims for unemployment benefits declined 3,000 to 420,000 in the week ending December 11, the Labor Department said Thursday. The four-week moving average of claims, a measure used to smooth weekly volatility in the data, fell 5,250 to 422,750—the sixth straight weekly decline. Continuing claims, reflecting benefits drawn for more than a week, rose 22,000 to 4.14 million in the week ending December 4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New jobless claims are down to their lowest level since the summer 2008, before the financial crisis sent layoffs surging. The figures suggest the government's report on December employment—due early next month—will be better than the disappointing November report, which said payrolls increased by just 39,000 last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest report on jobless claims "strengthens our expectation that the November payrolls figure will be revised higher or that the December reading will show a nice gain that corroborates other statistical and anecdotal evidence showing a healthier labor market," RBS economists said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, new housing starts rose 3.9% in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 555,000, the Commerce Department said. The gain was driven by a 6.9% increase in new construction of single-family homes, which represent 80% of all starts, to a six-month high. Multifamily construction, a traditionally volatile measure, declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures were only a modest positive in a sector that's struggling with a glut of supply. More existing homes are expected to hit the market in the next year as lenders foreclose on overdue borrowers, putting downward pressure on overall house prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-construction market is unlikely to recover significantly anytime soon given the high inventory on the market. Housing starts should be at a rate of about 900,000 given today's pace of population growth and the current replacement rate for homes, said economist Paul Dales of Capital Economics. "That shows just how much weak demand and the current high supply is weighing on home-building," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, a sign of future construction, fell 4% in November to an annual pace of 530,000. But that was driven by the volatile multifamily-housing segment; permits for single-family homes rose modestly during the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts showed their best performance in the Midwest, rising almost 16%. They rose about 2% in the South and the West. But starts fell 2.5% in the Northeast.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ringo Starr Lists</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Near Aspen</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ringo Starr and his wife, Barbara, are asking $4.5 million for their three-bedroom vacation home near Aspen, Colo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 70-year-old Beatles drummer, who continues to tour with his All Starr Band, bought the home in 1990. The wood cabin sits on about 16 flat acres in Woody Creek and has frontage on Roaring Fork River. The roughly 3,200-square-foot cabin was built in 1987 and is surrounded by unused horse paddocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's like a ranch-ette on the Roaring Fork," says Joshua Saslove of Joshua &amp; Co., a Christie's Great Estates affiliate, who represents the sellers. He said his clients have been using the home less frequently in the last few years. Hunter S. Thompson and musician Don Henley have had homes in Woody Creek.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lackey of Red Sox Buys in Boston</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Red Sox pitcher John Lackey bought a penthouse in Boston's Back Bay for just-under $2.1 million, 13% below its original, nearly $2.4 million asking price in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 32-year-old starter, who signed a five-year, $82.5 million deal with the Sox last December, bought a three-bedroom condominium of nearly 2,400 square feet in a townhouse. The living room looks onto the Charles River and Cambridge, and there's a terrace with views of Back Bay. The master bedroom suite has vaulted ceilings and a walk-in closet, and there's also a formal dining room. Tracy Campion of Campion &amp; Co. represented Mr. Lackey. Rick Egan of Coldwell Banker represented the sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">L.A. Home of Art World's Brodys</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sells for $14.9 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Los Angeles home of late art collectors Frances and Sidney F. Brody has sold for $14.9 million. It originally listed last spring for $25 million and most recently asked $19.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The A. Quincy Jones-designed modernist style house was where the Brodys displayed their extensive art collection, including a Picasso painting that sold at a Christie's auction in May for $106.5 million, a record for the most expensive work of art ever sold at auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 11,500-square-foot home, located on 2.3 acres in the Holmby Hills neighborhood, has five bedrooms and five bathrooms, with floor-to-ceiling glass windows as well as a guest house. There's also a swimming pool and four additional staff bedrooms in the main house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Brody, who lived in the home for nearly 60 years, died last year at age 93.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Fenton of Hilton &amp; Hyland represented the buyer, whom he declined to identify but described as a local real-estate investor who plans to renovate the house. Linda May and Jade Mills of Coldwell Banker Previews International had the listing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Louise Phillips Forbes had her second child, she didn't even consider moving to the suburbs. Instead, she sought a four-bedroom apartment in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I joke around with my husband that we had a prenup that said that we were raising our kids in the city," says Ms. Forbes, an executive vice president of Halstead Property. "For me, the ability to have a play date in a vertical environment, and not getting in my car and driving somewhere, is phenomenal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of families living in the city has been rising in recent years as has the number of five-person families, according to U.S. Census estimates and state birth-rate data. Those factors, combined with a flood of larger apartments conceived at the height of the real-estate boom, have led to an increase in urban apartments with suburban proportions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of four-bedroom apartments sold in Manhattan has nearly doubled over the past five years, to 270 in 2009 from 136 in 2005, according to the appraisal firm Miller Samuel Inc. Sales of large apartments began rising in the 1990s, only to decline sharply after the economic crash of 2001. But in the past five years they have resumed their upward trend, with sales of apartments with four or more bedrooms rising by 29% in the third quarter from the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many years, Manhattan buyers seeking four-bedroom apartments were largely limited to a handful of prewar buildings or they faced the often tricky process of construction to combine adjacent units. Ms. Forbes, for example, put together two apartments about four years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But more new high-end buildings—especially those in such family oriented neighborhoods as the Upper West and Upper East Sides—have included a higher proportion of large apartments, and developers and brokers say that those apartments are selling well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I believe what we're seeing is, the demographics of New York City over the last five years have really changed significantly, where you see a lot of young families electing to stay in Manhattan and not move to suburbia," said Susan de Franca, president of Related Sales, a unit of developer Related Cos. "There's a significant demand for family-sized apartments."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting around 2004, Ms. de Franca says, her company began planning its new developments with these larger families in mind. Related's Brompton, on the Upper East Side, includes 27 apartments with four or more bedrooms, and the Harrison, which is on the Upper West Side and includes 16 apartments with four or more bedrooms. Both are "virtually sold out," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditionally, new developments consisted mainly of studios and one- and two-bedroom apartments, brokers and developers say. Because they were priced lower, these apartments appeal to a larger segment of buyers and sold more quickly than larger units, so they are considered less of a gamble. But for some developers, that conventional wisdom is changing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the locations where we were building, we felt it wasn't that big a risk," says Gary Barnett, president of Extell Development Co. "We actually have deliberately built quite a few larger-sized apartments, and we have absolutely seen a very strong demand for them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past few months, he says, several four bedrooms—and even some five and six-bedrooms—have sold at the Lucida, a condominium tower at East 85th Street and Lexington Avenue. Large apartments also have sold at 535 West End and at the Rushmore, at 80 Riverside Blvd. Prices for the units have ranged between $3.5 million and $17 million, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the U.S. Census's New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey, apartments with four or more bedrooms represented more than 12% of owner-occupied units in New York City in 2008, compared with 12.8% in 2005. The city's Buildings Department doesn't track new units by the number of bedrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because they remain relatively scarce, four-bedroom apartments cost more per square foot than three-bedroom units, which, in turn, cost more than two-bedroom apartments; prices for these large units can climb to $20 million or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price per square foot for Manhattan four-bedroom apartments in new developments currently on the market is $1,793, 11% higher than the median price per square foot of three-bedrooms and 46% higher than two-bedrooms, according to StreetEasy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you can afford it, it's much more gracious to be able to have a larger space," says Extell's Mr. Barnett. "It's a nicer way of living."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A private-equity firm that has been focusing on distressed and unusual New York properties bought a Manhattan office building for $135 million in a sign that there are still bargains in the city's commercial real estate market for investors who are bullish on the city's future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price Savanna paid for the 513,000-square-foot property at 1375 Broadway came to $263 a square foot. That's one of the lowest prices paid this year for a New York office building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the building in the Garment District also comes with a number of challenges including the need of upgrades to its facade, lobby, common corridors and entrance. Savanna expects to spend about $20 million over five years on those improvements and leasing costs, though some industry experts think the cost could run higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property at 37th Street, which is about 90% leased, also doesn't currently chalk up great financial performance. Its annual net income represents roughly a 3.8% return on the $135 million that Savanna is paying. Buyers of other office property this year have been looking at returns—often referred to in the real estate industry as "capitalization rates"—in the 5% to 6% range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building appealed to Savanna partly because about half of its leases are up over the next five years. The building's average rent is about $20 a square foot while comparable properties south of Times Square on Broadway leases begin around the high $30s a square foot range, according to Nicholas Bienstock, a Savanna managing partner. So he expects to be able to increase rent even if the market rate stays flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal comes as investors throughout the world have been bidding up the price of modern Manhattan office buildings, especially those in prime locations. For example, last summer Mortimer Zuckerman's Boston Properties paid close to an estimated $1,000 a square foot for a new, but empty 30-story office tower on Madison Ave. and 53rd Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purchase of 1375 Broadway marks the fourth acquisition of a Manhattan office property this year for Savanna, a firm with about $1 billion under management. There have been twists and turns to all of the firm's deals. For example, it purchased properties on Park Avenue South, Hanover Square and West 40th street after their owners had defaulted on the first mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investment fund found the Broadway building compelling in part because of a different kind of wrinkle: the property had two separate owners. Chedward Realty Corp. owned the land while Statecourt Enterprises Inc. held a long-term ground lease that expires in 19 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of its purchase, Savanna reunited the lease and the so-called fee ownership. "Both sellers got more than they could have gotten individually, but we feel we got a good price in acquiring them together, given the level of rents in this neighborhood and recent comparable sales," says Mr. Bienstock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Baxter, vice chairman of the New York capital markets for Jones Lang Lasalle, says he thought Savanna got the property at a good price, in part because some potential buyers may have been put off by the separate ground lease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he added: "It's another sign of a resurgence in New York City prices," he said. With limited supply and scant speculative construction, prices in New York are likely to continue to rebound faster than most other property markets.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing bulls mightn't want to dig too deeply into the data. Buried in the Federal Reserve's huge "flow of funds" report on Thursday was this bit of troubling news: The value of U.S. real estate sank by $698 billion in the third quarter. It was the first decline in almost two years, and it wiped out the gains of the prior five quarters. It also leaves the total value of U.S. real estate at about $18.3 trillion. That is a 26% drop from the 2006 peak and the lowest since 2003. With such a wealth hole left by the housing crash, no wonder the Fed is shoveling so furiously.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New jobless claims climbed last week, damping hopes for a quickening improvement in the labor market. But a sharp gain in an indicator of future home sales offered a positive sign for the beleaguered housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial claims for unemployment compensation rose 26,000 to a seasonally adjusted 436,000 in the week ended Nov. 27, the Labor Department said Thursday. The latest jump erased most of the prior week's substantial decline, a move that had suggested a rapid turn toward stronger employment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, jobless claims are making slow progress toward healthier levels. The four-week moving average of claims, a measure used to smooth weekly volatility, stood at 431,000, the lowest since August 2008. Initial claims were close to 300,000 in the months before the recession started in late 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Continuing claims, drawn by unemployed individuals for more than a week, climbed 53,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.27 million in the week ended Nov. 20. The figure could drop later this month after an extension of unemployment benefits—to as long as 99 weeks—expired this week. Some two million people could lose their benefits by year's end unless Congress passes a new extension.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending Home Sales Increase</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a housing-industry index that tracks pending sales of existing homes gained 10.4% to 89.3 in October from a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors index, which tracks home contracts that have been signed but not closed, indicates transactions coming in the following two months. It suggests a jump in overall existing home sales at least for November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The October increase followed a 1.8% drop in September. Coming in a month in which some banks halted foreclosure sales, the gain offered hope that troubles with foreclosures wouldn't derail the overall market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the index remained more than 20% below its October 2009 mark. And its latest boost only brought it back to the level seen before a federal tax credit for home buyers drew buyers into the market and boosted sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In absolute terms these remain very depressed levels, and there is considerably more territory to cover in order to call the move anything more than a rebound from a post-tax credit air pocket," said Joshua Shapiro, U.S. chief economist at MFR Inc., a consultancy.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sudeep Reddy   </div><div>480 words</div><div>3 December 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New jobless claims climbed last week, damping hopes for a quickening improvement in the labor market. But a sharp gain in an indicator of future home sales offered a positive sign for the beleaguered housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial claims for unemployment compensation rose 26,000 to a seasonally adjusted 436,000 in the week ended Nov. 27, the Labor Department said Thursday. The latest jump erased most of the prior week's substantial decline, a move that had suggested a rapid turn toward stronger employment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, jobless claims are making slow progress toward healthier levels. The four-week moving average of claims, a measure used to smooth weekly volatility, stood at 431,000, the lowest since August 2008. Initial claims were close to 300,000 in the months before the recession started in late 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Continuing claims, drawn by unemployed individuals for more than a week, climbed 53,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.27 million in the week ended Nov. 20. The figure could drop later this month after an extension of unemployment benefits -- to as long as 99 weeks -- expired this week. As a result, some two million people could lose their benefits by year's end unless Congress passes a new extension.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a housing-industry index that tracks pending sales of existing homes gained 10.4% to 89.3 in October from a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors index, which tracks home contracts that have been signed but not closed, indicates transactions coming in the following two months. It suggests a jump in overall existing home sales at least for November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The October increase followed a 1.8% drop in September. Coming in a month in which some banks halted foreclosure sales, the gain offered hope that troubles with foreclosures wouldn't derail the overall market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the index remained more than 20% below its October 2009 mark. And its latest boost only brought it back to the level seen before a federal tax credit for home buyers drew buyers into the market and boosted sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In absolute terms these remain very depressed levels, and there is considerably more territory to cover in order to call the move anything more than a rebound from a post-tax credit air pocket," said Joshua Shapiro, U.S. chief economist at MFR Inc., a consultancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in the U.S. are falling, which, along with a weak economy, hurts demand. Home prices nationally were down 2% in the third quarter compared with the second quarter, according to the S&amp;P Case-Shiller national price index released this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While lower prices mean more people can afford homes, a downward trend in prices discourages some would-be buyers as they opt to wait for a better deal.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(See Correction &amp; Amplification below[U4015714970201LG] .)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group Inc</span>.'s $2.2 billion acquisition of Trammell Crow near the top of the boom saddled the real-estate firm with so much debt, some worried during the depths of the downturn that the company would topple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now that CBRE has survived that near-death experience, the deal is looking smarter. By buying Trammell Crow, CBRE became the world's leading provider of services to Fortune 500 companies that own or lease property but want others to lease and manage it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To cut expenses during the downturn, a growing number of corporations are outsourcing such duties, providing CBRE with a growing business at a time when uncertainty continues to grip the commercial real-estate industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, CBRE's outsourcing business has accounted for 40% of CBRE's global revenue this year, compared with 15% in 2006. In the first nine months of 2010, the unit raked in a record $1.3 billion in revenue. New clients include <span class="companylink">American International Group Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">NYSE Euronext</span> and <span class="companylink">United Technologies Corp</span>. in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Crow acquisition gave us a tremendous buffer going into this unprecedented downturn and...was hugely helpful to us to maintaining profitability," said Brett White, chief executive of CBRE in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competitors that don't rely heavily on providing outsourced services haven't fared as well. Shares of <span class="companylink">Grubb &amp; Ellis Co</span>. are trading at roughly $1.15 a share as its investment-management business struggles. That service accounts for roughly 50% of the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, said William Marks, an analyst at JMP Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cushman &amp; Wakefield, a unit of <span class="companylink">Exor SpA</span>, a public Italian company, is having a rough year even though its fortunes are improving. The company suffered an operating loss of $10.9 million during the first nine months of the year, compared with a loss of $93.8 million during the same period in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CBRE's stock, meanwhile, has soared about 40% since the beginning of the year, to more than $19 a share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outlook was much more dire in March 2009, when the company was grappling with insolvency concerns. Part of the problem was the 2006 acquisition of Trammell Crow, which added roughly $1.5 billion of debt to the company's balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late 2007, a year after the acquisition, the company opted to borrow to finance a $635 million share repurchase, at $22 a share. That was before its stock fell to $2.36, an all-time low, in March 2009. And in 2008 and 2009, the company had to raise about $650 million by selling equity at a low price, diluting shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But CBRE survived those dark days, partly thanks to its outsourcing business. The outsourcing services provided a solid revenue stream during most of last year as the company's traditional businesses of brokering sales and leasing transactions suffered because of the slow economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Trammell gave [CBRE] a huge outsourcing platform that has only grown since the peak," said Mr. Marks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While big corporations were avoiding making big leasing decisions, they also were cutting costs by hiring real-estate companies to run their buildings and manage their space needs. AIG's decision to hire CBRE last month will help the company "realize significant efficiencies and cost savings in our business operations world-wide," said Joe Barile, AIG senior vice president of global corporate real estate and client services, in a written statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CBRE's biggest competitor in outsourcing is <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Inc</span>., a Chicago-based real-estate company that has been in the business since the late 1980s. It too has benefited in recent years from having the business as a buffer against the strongest blows of the downturn. Jones Lang's share price has risen by about 30% since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We continue to see a very strong acceleration in the number of [requests for proposals] for outsourcing," said Chris Browne, director of Jones Lang's corporate-solutions business. Mr. Browne says there has been double-digit growth in the firm's outsourcing business since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, other firms are trying to grab a bigger piece of the outsourcing pie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Grubb &amp; Ellis</span> spokeswoman Janice McDill said the company is looking to expand its outsourcing operations, focusing on middle-market companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Santora, chief executive of Cushman &amp; Wakefield's outsourcing group, says it plans to "aggressively" increase its revenue over the next five years. Currently the group makes up about 20% of the company's revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Recurring revenue helps you in down markets," Mr. Santora said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anton Troianovski   </div><div>1034 words</div><div>1 December 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the boom years, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s vaunted real-estate investing unit bought trophy office buildings in San Francisco, a Boston development project, and glittering lodging properties like Hawaii's Grand Wailea resort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, the Wall Street giant is scouring the fringes of the property market in the hunt for high returns. One of its recent deals: a half-empty 60,000-square-foot shopping center in California's Inland Empire that houses a <span class="companylink">Fresh &amp; Easy Neighborhood Market</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That contrast tells the story of a real-estate investment powerhouse cautiously trying to rebuild its reputation after two years of recording some of the worst losses in the history of the business. As one of Wall Street's biggest commercial-real-estate investors during the boom, the bank raised billions of dollars from pension funds and other big investors and went on a global buying binge. The recession stuck <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> with severe losses—such as an $8.8 billion fund that about a year ago was projected to lose $5.4 billion—although some market improvements have led to write-ups in the firm's real-estate portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s most recent U.S. activity sheds light on how it is again searching for high-return opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s unit that seeks out "opportunistic," high-return real-estate investments has been driven toward overlooked and more volatile markets, buying, for example high-vacancy office buildings in Phoenix and Southern California. Instead of relying on borrowed money to boost returns, the firm is hoping to increase value by bringing deeply distressed properties back to health, a risky bet in an uncertain economy and one that is hard to execute in bite-size chunks on a multibillion-dollar scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory Fleming, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s president of investment management, said at a conference last month that the real-estate group was focused both on maximizing investor returns in existing funds as well as "putting the money to work that we have in the new vehicles in an environment where we think we can find attractive returns—always on a disciplined basis."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm's latest flagship opportunity fund, the $4.7 billion <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley Real Estate</span> Fund VII Global, or Msref VII, recently partnered with <span class="companylink">Lincoln Property Co</span>. to pay $23 million in cash for a new, empty office building in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale. That is less than half what the building cost to build, according to Lincoln executive David Binswanger, who voiced confidence he would be able to fill the building as local tenants move out of lower-quality office space nearby. But Glendale is one of Southern California's trickiest markets, with about one-fourth of the area's high-end office space sitting vacant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Msref VII also participated in a deal for $155 million in real-estate loans acquired at a discount from Hawaii-based <span class="companylink">Central Pacific Bank</span>. "Together, we're looking at more distressed portfolios," Jeffrey Dritley, managing partner of Msref's partner in the deal, Kearny Real Estate Co., said of <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>. The <span class="companylink">Central Pacific Bank</span> portfolio included Margarita Center, the 60,000-square-foot shopping center in Murrieta, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund has also done deals overseas, including 23 retail properties in Germany and four office buildings in Japan. Msref's joint venture in Germany says it plans to invest several hundred million euros in German retail real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the U.S., Msref's recent deals have mostly been far smaller, seeking out markets avoided by the legions of real-estate investors who have been willing to pay top dollar for property in more stable markets like Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Contrary to conventional wisdom, we think the less-favorable, less-core markets can outperform in recoveries," Lauren Hochfelder Silverman, a <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> executive director, said at a recent real-estate conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To avoid repeating past mistakes, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> has instituted new safeguards, including more internal procedures that have to be followed before investments are approved and chief financial officers assigned to each fund, people close to the firm's real-estate group say. Industry veterans John Klopp and Olivier de Poulpiquet were appointed to co-head the real-estate group in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s more patient approach raises questions of its own—including whether the firm will be able to invest all the cash it has raised from investors. So far, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> has spent only about 20% of the $4.7 billion in commitments to Msref VII, a person familiar with the matter said. The firm is more than halfway through the fund's four-year "investment period" and faces a mid-2012 deadline after which it will no longer be able to call additional commitments. The slow start is frustrating some investors eager to see their cash deployed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That kind of makes us feel like we're sitting on the sidelines and our hands are tied," says Joaquin Lujan, real-estate portfolio manager for the New Mexico Public Employees Retirement Association, an investor in the <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> has reason to be cautious. In the last two years, its investments in many real-estate deals—from stakes in U.S. developers to European hotels—have been wiped out. A disastrous $6.5 billion buyout of <span class="companylink">Crescent Real Estate Equities Co</span>. led to $951 million in write-downs and other losses for the firm. The <span class="companylink">California State Teachers' Retirement System</span> reported losses of more than 80% in <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s $8.8 billion international real-estate fund as of March 31—but an increase of about 10% in the first quarter of this year, according to the most recent data reported by <span class="companylink">Calstrs</span>. The low-key approach shows up in other ways, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007 alone, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s real-estate unit published at least 30 press releases, many of them announcing big new acquisitions from St. Petersburg to Tokyo. Since March 12, 2008, the firm's Web real-estate website lists just one, a January 2010 announcement of a management change.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices nationwide were down 1.5% in the third quarter compared with a year ago, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price index released Tuesday.

</div><div class="author">By Anton Troianovski   </div><div>956 words</div><div>1 December 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the boom years, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s vaunted real-estate investing unit bought trophy office buildings in San Francisco, a Boston development project, and glittering lodging properties like Hawaii's Grand Wailea resort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, the Wall Street giant is scouring the fringes of the property market in the hunt for high returns. One of its recent deals: a half-empty 60,000-square-foot shopping center in California's Inland Empire that houses a <span class="companylink">Fresh &amp; Easy Neighborhood Market</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That contrast tells the story of a real-estate investment powerhouse cautiously trying to rebuild its reputation after two years of recording some of the worst losses in the history of the business. As one of Wall Street's biggest commercial-real-estate investors during the boom, the bank raised billions of dollars from pension funds and other big investors and went on a global buying binge. The recession stuck <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> with severe losses -- such as an $8.8 billion fund that about a year ago was projected to lose $5.4 billion -- although some market improvements have led to write-ups in the firm's real-estate portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s most recent U.S. activity sheds light on how it is again searching for high-return opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s unit that seeks out "opportunistic," high-return real-estate investments has been driven toward overlooked and more volatile markets, buying, for example high-vacancy office buildings in Phoenix and Southern California. Instead of relying on borrowed money to boost returns, the firm is hoping to increase value by bringing deeply distressed properties back to health, a risky bet in an uncertain economy and one that is hard to execute in bite-size chunks on a multibillion-dollar scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory Fleming, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s president of investment management, said at a conference last month that the real-estate group was focused both on maximizing investor returns in existing funds as well as "putting the money to work that we have in the new vehicles in an environment where we think we can find attractive returns -- always on a disciplined basis."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm's latest flagship opportunity fund, the $4.7 billion <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley Real Estate</span> Fund VII Global, or Msref VII, recently partnered with <span class="companylink">Lincoln Property Co</span>. to pay $23 million in cash for a new, empty office building in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale. That is less than half what the building cost to build, according to Lincoln executive David Binswanger, who voiced confidence he would be able to fill the building as local tenants move out of lower-quality office space nearby. But Glendale is one of Southern California's trickiest markets, with about one-fourth of the area's high-end office space sitting vacant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Msref VII also participated in a deal for $155 million in real-estate loans acquired at a discount from Hawaii-based <span class="companylink">Central Pacific Bank</span>. "Together, we're looking at more distressed portfolios," Jeffrey Dritley, managing partner of Msref's partner in the deal, Kearny Real Estate Co., said of <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>. The <span class="companylink">Central Pacific Bank</span> portfolio included Margarita Center, the 60,000-square-foot shopping center in Murrieta, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund has also done deals overseas, including 23 retail properties in Germany and four office buildings in Japan. Msref's joint venture in Germany says it plans to invest several hundred million euros in German retail real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the U.S., Msref's recent deals have mostly been far smaller, seeking out markets avoided by the legions of real-estate investors who have been willing to pay top dollar for property in more stable markets like Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Contrary to conventional wisdom, we think the less-favorable, less-core markets can outperform in recoveries," Lauren Hochfelder Silverman, a <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> executive director, said at a recent real-estate conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To avoid repeating past mistakes, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> has instituted new safeguards, including more internal procedures that have to be followed before investments are approved and chief financial officers assigned to each fund, people close to the firm's real-estate group say. Industry veterans John Klopp and Olivier de Poulpiquet were appointed to co-head the real-estate group in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s more patient approach raises questions of its ownincluding whether the firm will be able to invest all the cash it has raised from investors. So far, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> has spent about 20% of the $4.7 billion in commitments to Msref VII, a person familiar with the matter said. The firm is more than halfway through the fund's four-year "investment period" and faces a mid-2012 deadline, after which it will no longer be able to call additional commitments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That kind of makes us feel like we're sitting on the sidelines and our hands are tied," says Joaquin Lujan, real-estate portfolio manager for the New Mexico Public Employees Retirement Association, an investor in the <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> has reason to be cautious. In the last two years, its investments in many real-estate deals -- from stakes in U.S. developers to European hotels -- have been wiped out. A disastrous $6.5 billion buyout of <span class="companylink">Crescent Real Estate Equities Co</span>. led to $951 million in write-downs and other losses for the firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">California State Teachers' Retirement System</span> reported losses of more than 80% in <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s $8.8 billion international real-estate fund as of March 31 -- but an increase of about 10% in the first quarter of this year, according to the most recent data reported by <span class="companylink">Calstrs</span>.</p>

</div><div class="author">By A.D. Pruitt </div><div>796 words</div><div>1 December 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group Inc</span>.'s $2.2 billion acquisition of Trammell Crow near the top of the boom saddled the real-estate firm with so much debt, some worried during the depths of the downturn that the company would topple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now that CBRE has survived that near-death experience, the deal is looking smarter. By buying Trammell Crow, CBRE became the world's leading provider of services to Fortune 500 companies that own or lease property but want others to lease and manage it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To cut expenses during the downturn, a growing number of corporations are outsourcing such duties, providing CBRE with a growing business at a time when uncertainty continues to grip the commercial real-estate industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, CBRE's outsourcing business has accounted for 40% of CBRE's global revenue this year, compared with 15% in 2006. In the first nine months of 2010, the unit raked in a record $1.3 billion in revenue. New clients include <span class="companylink">American International Group Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">NYSE Euronext</span> and <span class="companylink">United Technologies Corp</span>. in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Crow acquisition gave us a tremendous buffer going into this unprecedented downturn and . . . was hugely helpful to us to maintaining profitability," said Brett White, chief executive of CBRE in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competitors that don't rely heavily on providing outsourced services haven't fared as well. Shares of <span class="companylink">Grubb &amp; Ellis Co</span>. are trading at roughly $1.15 a share as its investment-management business struggles. That service accounts for roughly 50% of the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, said William Marks, an analyst at JMP Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cushman &amp; Wakefield, a unit of <span class="companylink">Exor SpA</span>, a public Italian company, is having a rough year even though its fortunes are improving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company suffered an operating loss of $10.9 million during the first nine months of the year, compared with a loss of $93.8 million during the same period in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CBRE's stock, meanwhile, has soared about 40% since the beginning of the year, to more than $19 a share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outlook was much more dire in March 2009, when the company was grappling with insolvency concerns. Part of the problem was the 2006 acquisition of Trammell Crow, which added roughly $1.5 billion of debt to the company's balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late 2007, a year after the acquisition, the company opted to borrow to finance a $635 million share repurchase, at $22 a share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was before its stock fell to $2.36, an all-time low, in March 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in 2008 and 2009, the company had to raise about $650 million by selling equity at a low price, diluting shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But CBRE survived those dark days, partly thanks to its outsourcing business. The outsourcing services provided a solid revenue stream during most of last year as the company's traditional businesses of brokering sales and leasing transactions suffered because of the slow economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Trammell gave [CBRE] a huge outsourcing platform that has only grown since the peak," said Mr. Marks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While big corporations were avoiding making big leasing decisions, they also were cutting costs by hiring real-estate companies to run their buildings and manage their space needs. AIG's decision to hire CBRE last month will help the company "realize significant efficiencies and cost savings in our business operations world-wide," said Joe Barile, AIG senior vice president of global corporate real estate and client services, in a written statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CBRE's biggest competitor in outsourcing is <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Inc</span>., a Chicago-based real-estate company that has been in the business since the late 1980s. It too has benefited in recent years from having the business as a buffer against the strongest blows of the downturn. Jones Lang's share price has risen by about 30% since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We continue to see a very strong acceleration in the number of [requests for proposals] for outsourcing," said Chris Browne, head of Jones Lang's corporate-solutions business. Mr. Browne says there has been double-digit growth in the firm's outsourcing business since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, other firms are trying to grab a bigger piece of the outsourcing pie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Grubb &amp; Ellis</span> spokeswoman Janice McDill said the company is looking to expand its outsourcing operations, focusing on middle-market companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Santora, chief executive of Cushman &amp; Wakefield's outsourcing group, says it plans to "aggressively" increase its revenue over the next five years. Currently the group makes up about 20% of the company's revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Recurring revenue helps you in down markets," Mr. Santora said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing Still Awaits Its Happy Ending</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy and consumers are looking a bit perkier these days. Housing, not so much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the government revised upward its estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product growth, weekly jobless claims fell to their lowest level in two years and personal incomes posted a strong gain in October. Consumer-confidence data due Tuesday are expected to rise, while Friday's November employment report could show the addition of another 150,000 or so jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is a different story. October new-home sales sank 8.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of only 283,000, just off record lows, while existing-home sales slid 2.2% in October to a 4.43 million annual rate. On Tuesday, S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price index data through September is expected to show a 0.5% month-on-month fall, while pending home sales figures Thursday are also expected to remain weak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Granted, housing has shaken off the worst of the hangover that followed April's expiration of the federal government's home-buyer tax credit. Housing inventory, for example, fell from 12 months of supply for single-family homes and condos this summer, to about 10.5 months in October, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the market is merely bouncing along a bottom, and demand is tepid, even with mortgage rates below 4.5%. Even excluding the summer surge, the number of months of housing inventory for sale is still at its highest level since November 2008. Plus, the figures don't include 2.1 million units of "shadow" inventory not yet on the market, according to Corelogic, largely foreclosures in process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The danger is that today's renewed housing slowdown leads to a further leg down for home prices. Janney Capital Markets, at the bearish end of the spectrum, expects prices could fall another 10% to 15% by year-end 2012. That would clearly pose risks to the economy and banks. While most bigger banks would probably weather additional price falls of as much as 5%, a double-digit decline could force many to again build loan-loss reserves, denting profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further price falls will eventually get sales moving again. For now, though, it is likely declines will breed even more uncertainty, keeping home buyers on the sidelines and the housing market on its back.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Free enterprise is on the rise on Roosevelt Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For four decades, the state government has been the landlord for the stores that line the central corridor of Main Street on this two-mile-long island in the East River. And for just as long, there have been howls from residents about the winding strip's lackluster performance, as vacancy has been high, and a diverse offering of stores low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, after years of headaches and public fights over individual leases, the strip may go private.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state-controlled agency, Roosevelt Island Operating Corp., is considering a bid submitted earlier this fall from a joint venture of development firms Related Cos. and the Hudson Companies, which want to take over the 98,000 square feet of retail themselves. The venture was the only bidder for the whole strip, although a co-op building submitted a proposal to control the retail within its base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built out over the past half-century, Roosevelt Island has long been something of an oddity in the world of New York City real estate. Once named Welfare Island for its hospitals and asylums, it's now an almost quaint community of more than 12,000 residents, connected to Manhattan by the F train and a red tram fit for the Swiss Alps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With austere red signs set in the bases of concrete and brick buildings, the state-owned retail on the northern portion of the island is a relic of an era of top-down government planning, when the state assumed control of retail under apartments as they were built out. Vacancy is high -- 20%, according to the state agency -- and many of the storefronts are occupied by nonprofits and government agencies; Soviet references aren't uncommon in real estate circles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State officials are quick to acknowledge that the agency is not an ideal landlord, given the additional layers of bureaucracy inherent to leasing from the state. Further, leasing can quickly become politicized, with the board of the state agency -- which includes local residents -- receiving criticism when it attempts to evict tenants who have not paid rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, for instance, the state agency backed out of an agreement to bring in a Dunkin' Donuts after residents rose up in protest to defend an existing art gallery at the space that paid no rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bidding process is being overseen by real-estate firm <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, which said in its request for proposals that the retail takes in about $900,000 in annual income from the space, a number the agency wants to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Retail can sometimes be a subjective art as opposed to a financial science," said Paul Mas, a broker with <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> who is overseeing the bidding. "So I think the state, with its regulatory repsonsibilties, had a tough time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related and Hudson, which have developed six buildings on the southern half of the island, where they control their own retail, say they would invest in upgrading the space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We envision a dynamic vibrant retail corridor occupied by neighborhood retailers that's well designed and is very successful," says David Kramer, principal of Hudson Cos. "You have a captive audience on Roosevelt Island who are currently not spending their retail dollars on Roosevelt Island."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some of the very benefits that the state sees from bringing in an outside firm independent of the politics of the island have led to concerns from residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, the only other bidder for the retail, the co-op association of the Rivercross apartment building, is bidding for control over its own retail in attempt to avoid certain types of tenants. For example, a noisy bar once occupied the space and was the subject of many a resident complaint, says Steven Kaufman, treasurer of the association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They have different motives than we do -- they'll be in this to make money for themselves," Mr. Kaufman says of Related and Hudson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We want to control the space so we can protect our building."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should the state indeed move forward on the plan, a deal with one or both of the bidders isn't likely to happen until the new year, officials say, when the agency's board would need to approve any new contract.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy expanded at a slightly faster pace than previously thought in the third quarter and corporate profits rose, but growth is still too weak to cut unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, home resales dipped in October after two months of increases, with a weak economy and worries about flaws in foreclosure documents keeping buyers away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services produced, rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.5% in July through September, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. In the government's first report, released Oct. 29, GDP was estimated to have risen 2% in the third quarter, following a 1.7% growth rate in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy has expanded for five straight quarters, but unemployment remains high at 9.6%. Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires expected GDP would be revised up to a 2.4% growth rate in the July-to-September period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also showed companies, especially in the financial sector, posted higher profits in the third quarter. After-tax earnings rose by 3.2%, compared with the second quarter's gain of just 0.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GDP breakdown showed spending by Americans, accounting for about 70% of demand in the U.S. economy, rose at a 2.8% rate in July through September, compared with a previously reported 2.6% rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Top private forecasters believe growth will be sluggish in 2011, weighed down by high public debt and unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exports rose 6.3%, up from the 5% increase estimated in the previous release and following a 9.1% second-quarter rise. Imports, which subtract from GDP, rose 16.8% in the quarter, lower than the previous estimate of a 17.4% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously occupied homes decreased by 2.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.43 million, the National Association of Realtors said. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected home sales to drop 0.7% to an annual rate of 4.5 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy expanded at a slightly faster pace than previously thought in the third quarter and corporate profits rose, but growth is still too weak to cut unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, home resales dipped in October after two months of increases, with a weak economy and worries about flaws in foreclosure documents keeping buyers away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services produced, rose at an annual seasonally adjusted rate of 2.5% in July through September, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the government's first report, released Oct. 29, GDP was estimated to have risen by 2% in the third quarter, following a 1.7% growth rate in the second quarter. U.S. GDP, the broadest measure of the economy's performance, started to grow again in the third quarter of 2009 following the worst recession since the 1930s. The economy has now been expanding for five straight quarters, but unemployment remains disappointingly high at 9.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires were expecting GDP would be revised up to a 2.4% growth rate in the July-to-September period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also showed that companies, especially in the financial sector, managed to post higher profits in the third quarter. But the gains were below the double-digit increases seen at the start of the year. After-tax earnings rose by 3.2%, compared with the second quarter's gain of just 0.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GDP breakdown showed that spending by Americans, accounting for about 70% of demand in the U.S. economy, rose at a 2.8% rate in July through September, compared with a previously reported 2.6% rate. Though the best increase in consumer spending since before the recession, it remains well below levels seen following previous downturns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Top private forecasters believe growth will be sluggish in 2011, weighed down by high public debt and unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the National Association of Business Economics predicted GDP would rise about 2.5% this year and next. The NABE expects unemployment to still be above 9% at the end of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's report showed the economy got some help from exports, which have benefited from a weaker dollar. Exports rose 6.3%, up from the 5% increase estimated in the previous release and following a 9.1% second-quarter rise. Imports, which subtract from GDP, rose 16.8% in the quarter, lower than the previous estimate of a 17.4% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously occupied homes decreased by 2.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.43 million, the National Association of Realtors said.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell in October amid weak demand and concerns about the foreclosure process, putting sales for 2010 on pace to close at their lowest level in 13 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales declined to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.43 million units last month, down 2.2% from September, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales plunged in October as the U.S. housing market continued to struggle absent government incentives to spur deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes in the U.S. slid 8.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 283,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. The fall was the fourth in six months. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected sales would rise 2.3% to an annual rate of 314,000 in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">October's new home sales figure is down 28.5% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High unemployment, tight credit and uncertainty regarding the direction of home prices are keeping buyers at bay. Their reluctance comes as the industry continues to suffer from the fallout of a building boom, which resulted in a high level of sales to speculators who often flipped the properties to borrowers unable to pay for the risky mortgages they took out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report on existing home sales this week showed that sector of the real estate market also is struggling. Existing home sales slid by 2.2% in October to a 4.43 million annual rate, the National Association of Realtors reported Tuesday. The drop was less than analysts, worried about the impact of the latest foreclosure paperwork mess, were expecting. Flaws in documentation practices by mortgage servicers have led some banks to halt foreclosure proceedings, delaying the closings of some deals and driving down sales figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government earlier this year lured reluctant home buyers out with tax credits, but those expired in April, pushing down sales in subsequent months. After the credit's expiration, new home sales fell nearly 32% in May. Sales levels have since been volatile. In October, the annual rate of new home sales was barely higher than it was in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales fell across much of the country in October. The South, however, posted a 3.1% increase in new home sales. New home sales fell 12.1% in the Northeast, 20.4% in the Midwest and 23.9% in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, the median sale price for a new home fell 9.4% on a year-over-year basis to $194,900, just $800 higher than it was in October 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of new homes available for sale fell 0.5% to 202,000, a supply that would take 8.6 months to exhaust. A six-month supply of new homes is considered healthy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell in October amid weak demand and concerns about the foreclosure process, putting sales for 2010 on pace to close at their lowest level in 13 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales declined to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.43 million units last month, down 2.2% from September, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures provide the first sign of the impact that suspensions of foreclosed property sales have had on the housing market. Several banks halted those sales in late September to address questions about the integrity of the foreclosure process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing markets across the country have been fueled by sales of bank-owned properties, and delays had prompted fears of a new round of aftershocks for battered housing markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To the extent people had any concern about being able to get clear title, they're going to stand back on distressed properties," said Douglas Duncan, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>. He said foreclosure delays were one of many factors that justified the mortgage company's "continued view of weak demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, foreclosures and other distressed sales accounted for 34% of all sales last month, compared with 35% in September, according to a NAR survey of real-estate agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ivy Zelman, chief executive of research firm Zelman &amp; Associates Inc., said the foreclosure suspensions had contributed "modestly" to October's decline and said she expected a similar impact in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank delays are likely to have an uneven effect, hitting hardest in states such as Florida, New Jersey and Illinois, where banks must foreclose through courts. In Orlando, for example, bank-owned properties accounted for 41% of October home resales, down from 47% in September, according to the Orlando Regional Realtor Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, foreclosure sales rose to 37% of resales last month in California, up from 36% in September, and to 53% of Las Vegas sales, up from 51%, according to MDA <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>, a real-estate research firm. Banks don't have to foreclose through courts in California or Nevada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks have said that document-handling errors are largely technical and can be corrected quickly. Still, as delays stretch from weeks to months, some homeowners who have been under contract to buy bank-owned properties may walk away from those deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> last month began offering monthly leases to potential buyers that had been under contract to buy foreclosed properties that were pulled off the market as a result of bank reviews. A company spokeswoman said leases were being offered to owner occupants on a case-by-case basis in order to assist homeowners that had already given up their leases or sold their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing markets remain challenged by high unemployment and concerns that prices will fall further, keeping home buyers on the sidelines. Home sales had risen modestly in August and September after plunging to 15-year lows in July following the expiration of home-buyer tax credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The underlying trend of home sales is still very weak," said Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist in Leesburg, Va. "Right now you need an increase in the number of people who are employed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> economists estimate home sales will total 4.78 million units for 2010, down 7% from a year earlier. The forecast calls for sales to increase by just 2% next year to 4.88 million units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Zelman, who has long been bearish on housing, says there are reasons to suggest 2011 could be better than many analysts expect. New-home inventories are very low and affordability is very high. "You won't see a heroic improvement, but maybe a modest improvement off of these post-World War II lows," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR, meanwhile, is raising concerns that more banks, stung by losses on bad loans made during the boom, have made their credit standards too strict, freezing some creditworthy buyers out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade group reported that the number of homes listed for sale fell to 3.86 million units in October, down by 3.4% from September levels. At the current sales pace, it would take 10.5 months to clear that inventory.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even among the many New York neighborhoods transformed by new construction during the real-estate boom, Long Island City stands out for its dramatic makeover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a dozen large housing developments have opened up in the Queens neighborhood in recent years and others are still under construction. The historically industrial area has become a major destination for Long Islanders looking for faster commutes and young professionals moving from Manhattan in search of more living space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area, located adjacent to the East River and south of Astoria, has long been touted as the next "hot" neighborhood. It has a thriving art scene anchored by the Museum of Modern Art's P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center. It's as close as one subway stop from Manhattan on the No. 7 train. And home prices have held up relatively well compared with the rest of the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is room for improvement. The neighborhood lacks the bar and restaurant scene of Brooklyn's Williamsburg and Long Island City is short on retail outlets found elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condo construction in Long Island City includes the Murano, a 12-story glass building with 76 units on Borden Avenue. The project, which will have a computerized lighting system that changes the hues of the exterior of the glass building every hour, features a roof deck, laundry room, a garden, parking garage, gym and sound-proof windows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Murano is scheduled to open in the first quarter and 30% of the units now are in contract, said Andrew Barrocas, chief executive of the Developers Group, a subsidiary of the Real Estate Group New York. Among the available units are a 689-square-foot one-bedroom listed at $480,000 and a two-bedroom measuring 1,234-square-feet priced at $865,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 122-unit L Haus opened late last year is 45% full. The 11-story development includes a 10,000-square-foot lawn, complete with lounges and grills, that serves as a communal yard. Amenities include a gym, a media room, yoga studio, club room and even a pet spa. Available units include a three-bedroom, two-bathroom duplex going for $1.3 million. A one-bedroom with 675-square-feet of space can be had for $465,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While new condo developments make up the majority of the area's available housing stock, every once in a while an older townhouse will come on the market. Near the neighborhood's tiny historic district, a two-bedroom condo is on sale in the Langley, a five-story Victorian walkup built in the 1890s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's the only place in Queens you will find this part of architecture repeating," said Reyn Rossington with CORE. "It looks like Brooklyn." The rest of the historical townhomes in the area are rentals, which are also hard to come by, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long Island City is one of the pricier neighborhoods in Queens given its proximity to Manhattan, but it's still cheaper than most properties on the other side of the East River. The median price per square foot in Long Island City is $700 versus $462 for Queens overall, according to real-estate site StreetEasy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the third quarter, there were 55 homes sold in Long Island City at the median price of $636,406, less than a 1% decline in prices from the same period last year, according to StreetEasy. In the third quarter of 2009, there were 97 homes sold at the median price of $641,497.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schools: Long Island City schools are in District 30 and include the Growing up Green Charter School, which features an environmental curriculum. Other schools include the Academy for Careers in Television and Film and the Jacob Blackwell School.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, 87.2% of District 30 students in grades three through eight received a proficient score on the math exam, and 74.9% of students received a proficient score on the English Language Arts exam. In 2006, the results were 64.8% for math and 58.5% for reading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private institutions include Most Precious Blood School, the Queensview Nursery School and Kindergarten and St. Joseph Elementary School.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parks: Long Island City doesn't have much park space, but what it has features spectacular views of the Manhattan skyline. Queensbridge Park, the neighborhood's largest green space measuring about 20 acres, sits right on the banks of the East River. During the summer, it hosts several concerts. The park has barbecue facilities, handball courts, baseball fields and dog runs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also in the neighborhood is the Socrates Sculpture Park, an open-air art exhibition space that is also on the East River. During the 1980s, the five-acre space was transformed from a landfill to the outdoor art venue that it is today. The current exhibition features work from the Emerging Artist Fellowship program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arts: In addition to P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, the neighborhood includes SculptureCenter, an exhibition space opened in 2002. The Museum of the Moving Image is currently under renovation and slated to reopen in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shopping: Foodcellar is a large grocery store that offers organic food and high-end products. There's also a <span class="companylink">Costco</span>. The neighborhood has several antique and vintage stores like Film Biz Recycling, which sells used props from television and commercial productions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dining: Fans of German beer should grab a braut and liter of beer at Wunderbar German Grill &amp; Bierhaus. The family-run Manetta's Ristorante offers thin brick-oven pizza. For Brazilian fare, try Malagueta located on the border of Long Island City and neighboring Astoria. Head to Riverview Restaurant and Lounge and grab a drink and enjoy the views of the river and Manhattan.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Cobb, a 77-year-old civil rights attorney from Newburgh, N.Y., is also a top-performing broker at the Rushmore, a glimmering Manhattan condominium with sweeping views of the Hudson River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He sold nine Rushmore apartments in 2006 and earned $669,000 in commission checks, according to internal sales documents from Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, the building's sales and marketing agent, that were reviewed by The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Cobb says he doesn't know anything about the apartments sold. And he has never met any of the people who bought those condos. "I don't know what the Rushmore is," he said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people familiar with the property say several of the nine apartments sold and attributed to Mr. Cobb were actually shown by Carolyn Li, whom Mr. Cobb said has been a friend for 15 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I didn't know about John Cobb's existence. I never heard of this man," says Rosy Mimoun, who with her husband bought three of the apartments credited in the documents to Mr. Cobb's sales but, she says, sold to her by Ms. Li. "We never knew of anyone but Carolyn Li."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under New York state law, only real estate brokers and lawyers can sell property on behalf of someone else and collect commissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a licensed New York attorney, Mr. Cobb is entitled to collect broker commissions but it is against the law for him to split them with someone who isn't a licensed broker. And it is against the law for someone who isn't a licensed broker to receive commissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of the documents reviewed by the Journal show that Mr. Cobb paid any commission money to Ms. Li.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Li instructed the building's developer and a Corcoran Sunshine agent that the developer would pay Mr. Cobb a 3% commission on the condo sales, according to an email Ms. Li sent them that was reviewed by the Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked whether she ever showed apartments at the Rushmore, Ms. Li said: "I don't want to discuss this. It's private information." Ms. Li said she isn't a licensed real estate broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cobb declined to say whether he split his commissions with Ms. Li or anyone else. Mr. Cobb says that someone he knows but declines to identify asked him if he would serve as a broker of record at a Manhattan building. He agreed, showed his credentials to representatives of Extell Development Corp., part of the partnership developing the building. Not long after that, he said, the commission checks from the developers started arriving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He can't explain why he received the money, but says: "Somebody here was trying to cut a corner. I didn't try to cut any corners. I was not party to any wrong doing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials at Corcoran Sunshine didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 271-unit Rushmore is one of three new residential buildings in New York developed by a partnership between Extell and Carlyle Realty Partners. The building is also known for a long-running legal dispute between the developers and 41 condo buyers who are trying to get out of their contracts and have their deposits returned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carlyle says it paid Mr. Cobb because his name was listed on the purchasing contracts as a broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The purchasers represented who their broker was, and as is standard practice, the Rushmore paid the brokerage fee," said Carlyle spokesman Chris Ullman. Gary Barnett, Extell president, declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Department of State, which regulates the New York real estate industry, can take a number of punitive measures against a broker who improperly splits commissions, including suspension of license and fines up to four times the amount of the commission received, says Joel Barkin, a spokesman for the department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said some cases could be misdemeanors, which would be a criminal charge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil Garfinkel, a residential real estate attorney, said the law was written to protect home buyers, so that they know that the person showing them apartments has a level of experience and knowledge of real estate law and practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Li, 42-years old, is from China and earned a PhD in finance from Rutgers University. She has worked for numerous financial firms, including <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>, <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> first Boston and <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Li bought a 36th floor apartment for which Mr. Cobb was credited as a broker. The sales documents showing her paying $3 million in 2006, which amounted to a $102,000 commission for Mr. Cobb, according to the sales documents. It's not clear whether she still owns the unit.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orange County Mansion Sells For $34.1 Million Plus Property</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Orange County mansion listed for $75 million in 2006 has sold for $34.1 million, public records show. A source familiar with the matter says the buyer also gave the seller a property valued at around $7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house originally listed in 2006 for $75 million, then came off the market a year later. Earlier this year, it relisted for $49.6 million. The home was owned by Frank Pritt, the founder of Attachmate, a company that specializes in a range of business-to-business products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located in Corona Del Mar, the 22,000-square-foot beachfront estate is known as Portabello. It has eight bedrooms, 10 bathrooms and two saltwater pools surrounded by grotto cliffs. The subterranean level of the home has a streetscape with a diner, bowling alley, movie theater and a jewelry store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer, according to public records, purchased the home through a Massachusetts-based limited liability company managed by Fariborz Maseeh, an entrepreneur and philanthropist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John McMonigle, of the McMonigle Group in Newport Beach, Calif., represented both the buyer and the seller.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1954-built home is less than a five-minute walk from the beach. The 5,600-square-foot Mediterranean-style home has six bedrooms, 6½ bathrooms and a grand library. The home also has a swimming pool with a fountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trucks purchased the home in 1999. He says he's selling because his children have grown and he and his wife are planning to retire in the south of France.</p>

</p><div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">U.S. News: Inflation Virtually Flat</span>
</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty   </div><div>755 words</div><div>18 November 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key gauge of U.S. inflation has fallen to its lowest level since record-keeping began in 1957, underscoring the continued weakness in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer prices rose 0.2% in October compared with September, almost entirely because of higher energy costs, the Labor Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When volatile food and energy are subtracted, prices were unchanged last month -- the third straight month in which this so-called core measure of inflation was flat. Compared with a year ago, consumer prices other than food and energy have risen 0.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in the core measure bolsters the Federal Reserve's case that inflation is so low -- below its informal target -- that it should resume its purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds to boost the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That move, announced Nov. 3, has been met with criticism from some Republican politicians, GOP-leaning economists and market analysts who argue, among other things, that the Fed is risking a bigger increase in inflation than it desires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers aren't expecting a run-up in overall prices anytime soon: On Wednesday the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland said consumers don't expect prices to rise more than 1.5% a year on average for the next decade. Consumers' expectations about inflation often drive their purchasing decisions, making rising or falling prices a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broken down into its various components, the consumer-price index shows a dichotomy in the economy: Prices of items most closely linked to global commodity markets and trade -- such as oil -- are rising, especially in developing nations that have mostly shrugged off the 2007-2009 recession. China this week moved to clamp down on surging prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, prices are much weaker for goods and services that aren't touched by global trade. The cost of a haircut was up just 0.4% in October from a year ago, after averaging 3% annual gains for much of the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low inflation was a big factor behind the Fed's controversial decision earlier this month to try to stimulate the economy by printing money and buying $600 billion in government bonds. Some Fed officials argued that unless they took the action, the U.S. would be at risk of deflation, a debilitating spiral of falling prices and wages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, prices have surged in some corners of the economy: Energy prices rose 2.6% in October, including a 4.6% jump at the gas pump, and many analysts and business leaders have predicted consumer prices will increase soon. Rising food and energy prices may be one reason many average consumers believe inflation is higher than government reports suggest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the reality is that most goods and services are still showing only modest price gains or outright price decreases. Food prices rose 0.1% in October, though certain staples went up much more. Dairy products were up 1.1%, while meat and poultry rose 0.6%. Clothing prices fell for the third consecutive month in October, by 0.3%; prices for used cars and trucks dropped 0.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tomme Arthur is among those holding the line on prices. Mr. Arthur, director of brewery operations for Port Brewing and The Lost Abbey, a specialty brewer in San Marcos, Calif., has seen costs go up for raw materials including cardboard for boxes. Yet, he said, "We don't believe it makes sense to pass on any increases to the consumer, given the concerns about the economy." Wednesday's report showed costs of alcoholic beverage up 0.2% in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Hickory Chair Co., a furniture manufacturer in Hickory, N.C., company president Jay Reardon has kept prices low by cutting costs. Hickory has seen the cost of raw materials and energy jump over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the company has trimmed its energy bills, said Mr. Reardon, by turning on machines only when they're needed, rather than powering all of them at once as the company once did. It also reduced lumber costs by devising uses for wood scraps that formerly were thrown out. "We've improved yields and offset the price increases in raw materials," said Mr. Reardon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report Wednesday showed October housing starts fell 11.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 519,000, driven by the volatile multifamily sector, which tumbled 43.5%, the Commerce Department said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumer prices continued to rise modestly in October as gasoline prices surged, but underlying inflation hit its lowest level in more than 50 years, supporting the Federal Reserve's recent move to try to boost the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seasonally adjusted consumer-price index last month rose 0.2% from September, the Labor Department said Wednesday. It was the fourth consecutive month that higher energy costs helped to push prices up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the so-called core inflation rate, which is more closely watched by the Fed, was unchanged as the price of new and used cars fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking out energy and food prices, which can be volatile from month to month, underlying consumer prices haven't moved since July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with October 2009, the annual underlying inflation rate hit 0.6%, the lowest level since records began in 1957. That is well below the Fed's informal inflation target of 1.5% to 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The low inflation shown in government reports in recent months was one factor in the Fed's controversial decision this month to try to stimulate the economy by printing money and buying government bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Fed officials expressed concern that unless they took action to charge up the economy, the U.S. was at risk of deflation, a spiral of falling prices and wages. But others remain concerned that the recent surge in commodity prices could eventually translate into higher consumer prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires ahead of the release expected consumer prices to rise by 0.3% and the core CPI to rise by 0.1% in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While not a base case, outright deflation in the core has to be viewed with greater probability now," said Jay Feldman, an economist at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>, in a note, adding that he is looking for a "rousing defense" from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed officials have been fighting growing criticism of the central bank's plan to buy $600 billion in U.S. Treasurys through June, saying the weak economy and low inflation warranted the move. Republicans say the bond purchases could lead inflation to surge and hurt the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">German and other foreign officials say the Fed is deliberately trying to push down the value of the dollar, an accusation the U.S. Fed officials have rejected. Mr. Bernanke will speak at a European Central Bank conference in Frankfurt on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report showed that, compared with October 2009, overall U.S. consumer prices are up 1.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher energy prices have also driven up inflation in the euro zone, with consumer prices there rising an annual 1.9% in October. That is the highest level since November 2008, but still in line with the European Central Bank's inflation target of close to, but below, 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking at the monthly changes in the U.S., energy prices rose 2.6% in October, the fourth consecutive monthly increase. Gasoline prices rose 4.6% last month after increasing by 1.6% in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Food prices were also higher, although the 0.1% increase was more modest than the previous two months. The index for dairy and related products posted the largest increase in the food-at-home index, rising 1.1% in October. Fruits and vegetables posted the biggest declines, falling 0.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other categories showed significant declines in prices. Used cars and trucks fell 0.9%, the biggest decline since March 2009. New-vehicle prices fell 0.2% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without rounding, the report showed that consumer prices rose 0.232% in October. Excluding food and energy items, consumer prices were actually down 0.007% unrounded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate government report showing the U.S. economy's continued weakness, housing starts fell 11.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 519,000. Building permits, a gauge of future construction, increased 0.5% to 550,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expected overall housing starts to fall 1.6% to 600,000. Starts in October fell to the lowest level since 477,000 in April 2009. The results were driven by a 43.5% decline in multifamily construction, a volatile part of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family-home construction, which represents more than 80% of all starts, declined 1.1% to 436,000, after rising a revised 2.1% in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mood is glum among home builders, which face a litany of troubles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While mortgage rates are low, unemployment is elevated, scaring off would-be buyers. Sales of new homes in September were down 21.5%, compared with a year earlier, the latest government data say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories relative to sales are high. Previously owned homes are cheaper. Builders say they aren't making progress securing financing to start new projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market's pulse is clearly faint," Weiss Research analyst Mike Larson said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By A.D. Pruitt  </div><div>879 words</div><div>17 November 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate-investment-trust industry is turning 50 years old this year and, to celebrate, landlords are giving investors a gift: bigger dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the nation's largest commercial real-estate companies, including <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Kimco Realty Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Nationwide Health Properties Inc</span>., raised their quarterly dividends this month, and more companies are expected to follow suit in the months ahead. The higher payouts reflect the higher rents and better occupancy levels, which are boosting the income pool for dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a change from the past few years, when REITs, along with other public companies, were busy cutting or suspending dividends in an effort to preserve cash to help ride out the recession. But since the beginning of the year, dozens of REITs have reversed course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brad Case, vice president of research and information at the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, says investors expect more dividend increases in the future because REIT earnings are improving. "The operating fundamentals in commercial real estate seem to be getting better in the major markets in general," says Mr. Case. This week, Mr. Case is making his bullish case about real-estate stocks at the REIT World conference in New York, which is sponsored by NAREIT.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the beginning of the year, 37 REITs have raised dividends, while seven have cut them. That is an about-face from last year, when 22 raised dividends and 61 either cut or suspended dividends, according to data provided by SNL Financial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While conditions are clearly improving, dividend payouts still aren't as lush as they were at the height of the market in 2005 and 2006, when dividend increases reached 104 and 100, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The pace is picking up, but it's not what it was in the heyday," says Mike Kirby, director of research for Green Street Advisors. He notes that most REITs are trying to be conservative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs in the health-care industry were among those most likely to raise dividends. Nationwide Health Properties, based in Newport Beach, Calif., increased its quarterly dividend 2% to 47 cents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest landlords were also more likely to restore their dividends. Shopping-center landlord <span class="companylink">Kimco Realty</span>, of New Hyde Park, N.Y., this month said it will raise its quarterly dividend 12.5% to 18 cents starting in first-quarter 2011. Last year, the company cut its quarterly dividend from 44 cents to six cents for the last two quarters of 2009, but raised it to 16 cents at the beginning of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We feel better about next year's . . . prospects," said Kimco Chief Executive David Henry in an interview during the REIT World conference. He said Kimco is filling vacant spaces at strip malls by signing leases with large national discount retailers like <span class="companylink">Ross Stores</span> and Marshalls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hotel sector, which had the greatest turmoil in the economic downturn, has been least likely to raise or restore dividends. A notable exception is <span class="companylink">LaSalle Hotel Properties</span>, which raised its dividend to 11-cent-a-share per quarter in September, after cutting it to one cent last year. The Bethesda, Md., company, which focuses on the upscale segment, was hit hard in the downturn but business is starting to improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first REITs were established in 1960 to give individuals an easy way to invest in income-producing real estate. The firms, which typically focus on distinct areas of real estate, such as offices, retail properties or apartments, must pay at least 90% of taxable income out as dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been a tumultuous 50 years. The industry started off as a somewhat stable avenue to invest in real estate but hasn't been immune to some of the worst real-estate crises in the past 30 years. In fact, two years ago, some critics thought the industry was headed for extinction because many REITs weren't generating enough income to pay off hefty loan balances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a few REITs disappeared, most survived. Now, investors are moving money back into REITs, in part because they expect higher earnings in the future and because they have relatively high yields, of which the dividend is partly responsible. The average REIT yield was about 4% at Oct. 31, compared with 1.96% for the S&amp;P 500-stock index and 2.6% for Treasurys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs aren't alone in raising dividends. Many large-cap and cash-flushed companies are expected to do the same. A recent report by Markit, a financial-information-services firm, expects a 50% jump in dividend increases for S&amp;P-500 companies in the fourth quarter from last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many REITs that cut dividends last year are still cautious about the future and want to keep enough dry powder to pay down debt or make acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We want to [reduce debt] and grow . . . . to the extent we have capacity is great," says Michael Glimcher, CEO of Ohio-based <span class="companylink">Glimcher Realty Trust</span>. "We're not quite there yet" to being in a position to increase our payout, he adds.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">China Limits Property Purchases By Foreigners</span>
</div><div class="author">By Esther Fung and Joy C. Shaw   </div><div>1214 words</div><div>14 November 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI—China announced new limits on the ability of foreigners to buy residential or commercial property on the mainland, in its latest effort to curb the inflows of speculative money into its economy and ease inflationary pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Observers said the effect would likely be small, since foreigners make up a tiny proportion of China property sales. But the lack of details about the move could add another element of uncertainty to a real-estate market that already contends with volatility and sharp surges in values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a joint statement Monday with the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange said on its website that foreign companies can purchase only commercial property that they plan to use themselves. It reinforced existing rules to limit foreign individuals to buying one residential unit per person for self-use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign investments accounted for 0.8% of property development in China last year, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The foreign-exchange administration, which regulates China's currency and is known as SAFE, didn't offer additional details or examples. Analysts said the restrictions on commercial properties probably pertain to companies that want to own and occupy buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S.-based private-equity firms, which have taken increasing interest in Chinese real estate in recent years, are closely watching the government's moves. <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s real-estate funds unit as well as Tishman Speyer Properties and Houston-based property giant Hines all have made investments in Chinese real estate since 2007, according to research firm <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives at U.S. firms that have been active investors in Chinese real estate said Monday it will take time to understand exactly what the new restrictions mean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Equity International</span>, a Chicago real-estate private-equity firm cofounded by property mogul Sam Zell, has invested in three Chinese real-estate companies but has grown wary because of the government's unpredictable policy moves, Chief Executive Gary Garrabrant said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our enthusiasm has been tempered based on our actual experience," Mr. Garrabrant said of investing in China. "We learned that the government is challenging because of the uncertainty that's created by continual refinement of the regulatory framework, and this new law is an example of it." <span class="companylink">Equity International</span> has focused more in recent years on Latin American countries, such as Brazil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some of those working with established players predicted that they wouldn't feel much impact, though investors seeking to enter China's market could face more obstacles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More government approval will likely be necessary for investments, but the government may continue to be flexible enough to allow certain types of investments, these people said. For example, the government might prevent a foreign investor from paying a record price for an office building, but it could be more likely to approve the rehabilitation of a dilapidated building, they said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some U.S. investors welcomed the government action. "As an investor, it actually gives you comfort that the government is concerned about speculation," said Keith Barket, a partner at New York-based investment company <span class="companylink">Angelo, Gordon &amp; Co</span>., which has invested about $1 billion in about 25 projects in China, about half of them residential developments in second-tier cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflows of what is known as hot money have complicated the central government's efforts to tame inflation and lending in order to curb its strong growth rates and contain inflation. Hot money is speculative capital that evades regulators in China, which keeps tight controls on its currency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAFE last week announced measures to further crack down on hot-money inflows, with senior officials in the country expressing concern that the U.S.'s loose monetary policy might send excessive amounts of money into emerging markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's consumer-price index rose 4.4% in October, accelerating from September's 3.6% rise to its highest level in two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall property prices in China, including residential and commercial, rose 0.2% in October from September, following a 0.5% increase in September. Prices rose 8.6% in October from a year earlier, down from September's 9.1% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the year-on-year rise in October prices was the sixth straight month of falling growth, the slowdown may be too gradual for policy makers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new restrictions announced Monday are reminiscent of similar moves in 2006, when China announced measures restricting property purchases by foreigners. Officials then said that only foreigners who had lived in China for more than one year could buy property, with the purchase capped at one apartment for self-use. Both rules are repeated in the current statement, though the latter rule hasn't been effectively enforced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liu Li-Gang, head of China economics at <span class="companylink">Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group</span>, said the measures could damp some demand in China's property market, especially the commercial property sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Targeting foreign investors is the easiest administrative means for the Chinese government to undertake because they represent a very small interest group," Mr. Liu said. "But when it comes to curbing hot-money inflows, the measures won't be that effective."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wang Tao, economist at <span class="companylink">UBS</span>, also said most of China's capital inflows stem from Chinese companies' offshore units funneling money into China. "The latest measures is part of a basket of policies aiming to cool the property market," Ms. Wang said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The joint statement also included a line saying that the authorities have room for interpretation of how the new rules could work, possibly allowing existing rules in the market to still apply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is still unclear whether foreign real-estate investment trusts or property developers will be hurt by the rules on commercial property, said UOB KayHian analyst Johnson Hu. "I don't think the government wants to kill off foreign direct investment in this segment, but is really trying to clamp down on illegitimate inflows into the property market," said Mr. Hu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Xia Bin, a central bank adviser, last week called for the authorities to investigate hot-money inflows because some capital has been unlawfully channeled into the country's stock market and the property sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Policy makers are trying to put on the brakes on capital inflows, similar to what had been announced back in 2006," said Remy Chan, managing director of CBD Commercial Investment Management. "How these rules are implemented is another matter, and if these rules are followed to the letter, there could possibly be no foreign investment in commercial property at all, but I have my doubts. The mature players will always find exceptions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For their part, Chinese investors have been looking to invest in the U.S. Last week, <span class="companylink">Bank of China Ltd</span>. closed an $800 million loan to Brookfield Office Properties of New York for an office tower in Manhattan—one of the biggest bank loans made for any U.S. property since the downturn hit. <span class="companylink">China Investment Corp</span>., the $300 billion sovereign-wealth fund, has looked to put cash into U.S. real estate by investing with U.S. property-fund managers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices fell in nearly half of U.S. metropolitan areas in the third quarter, indicating that the market is losing steam without government tax credits, according to an industry report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for home resales fell compared with last year in 76 out of 155 areas tracked by the National Association of Realtors, the trade group said Thursday. Prices rose in 77 areas and were unchanged in two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the second quarter of the year, prices rose in nearly two-thirds of U.S. cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median price for single-family homes, however, was nearly unchanged. It was $177,900 in the July-September quarter, down 0.2% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The metro areas showing the biggest declines from a year earlier were Ocala, Fla. (20%), Melbourne, Fla. (15%), and Tucson, Ariz. (15%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Showing gains were Burlington, Vt. (18%), Elmira, N.Y. (17%), and Dallas (14%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government sparked a surge in home sales at the start of the year by providing tax credits of up to $8,000, mainly for first-time owners. But since they expired, sales have slumped despite the lowest mortgage rates in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in the third quarter were down 25% from the second quarter, and down 21% from a year earlier, the Realtors group said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weak economy has kept buyers on the sidelines. Plus, uncertainty over the extent to which banks filed fraudulent foreclosure documents has caused some buyers to shy away from foreclosed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several lenders have stopped seizing properties over the past six weeks to fix document flaws.Once banks resolve those problems, analysts expect foreclosures to climb again. "Foreclosure sales are going to increase into next year, which will cause prices to decline further," said Celia Chen, a senior director with <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Partly as a result, the number of homes lost to foreclosure in October fell 9% from a month earlier to about 93,000, according to foreclosure-listing service RealtyTrac Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, "distressed property," including foreclosures and homes at risk of foreclosure, accounted for 34% of third-quarter transactions, up from 30% a year earlier, the Realtors estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices this year have been changing very little from year-ago readings," said Lawrence Yun, the Realtors' chief economist. "Areas with some larger swings in home price reflect the degree of distressed sales in those markets."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anton Troianovski   </div><div>915 words</div><div>11 November 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>26</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frustrated with the shortage of U.S. properties for sale, some of America's biggest publicly traded landlords are going global.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span>, which until now mostly has focused on investing in the U.S., has entered a bid for the global private-equity real-estate investment platform of Dutch financial company <span class="companylink">ING Groep NV</span>, people familiar with the matter said. The ING business generates management fees and could offer Vornado teams in Europe and Asia, as well as the U.S., to manage property and scout for deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An ING spokeswoman declined to comment on Vornado's involvement, but said the Dutch bank is "conducting an evaluation" of the real-estate investment-management business, which has about $100 billion in assets under management, and that "a sale is not ruled out." Along with Vornado, private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co</span>. and affiliates of real-estate brokerages <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Inc</span>. are among the firms still pursuing the business, people familiar with the matter said, with final bids due Dec. 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other U.S. office landlords including Brookfield Office Properties and <span class="companylink">SL Green Realty Corp</span>. in recent months did deals overseas or raised the possibility of doing them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"London is, in our view, a gateway city and a global financial capital," Marc Holliday, chief executive of SL Green, one of Manhattan's biggest office landlords, said in an interview. "It's more parallel and akin to New York than almost any other domestic U.S. market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But overseas acquisitions have stirred controversy. Some investors and analysts wonder whether there still are good deals to be had for U.S. real-estate investment trusts. Many overseas markets already are well-traveled both by local companies and U.S. firms that pursue private-equity strategies, such as the real-estate units of <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>. In the U.K., an index of office-building values is up 24% in the last year, according to <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, and London property prices in particular have been bid up by a flood of foreign buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs pursuing global strategies also have been criticized for straying beyond their expertise and possibly confusing Wall Street with a hodgepodge of properties. Publicly traded real-estate investment trusts generally have attracted investors by more targeted deal making: allowing people to invest in, say, shopping centers in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For most REITs, investing overseas is not a core competency," said <span class="companylink">UBS</span> analyst Ross Nussbaum. After SL Green disclosed last month that it had bought the debt backing an office building in London, Mr. Nussbaum dubbed it "the head scratcher of the week" because the company has made its name focusing on New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new appetite for overseas investments is partly fueled by the enormous amount of cash public real-estate companies have raised in the past two years for acquisitions. Real-estate investment trusts sold $34.6 billion in debt and equity in 2009 and more than $35.3 billion this year partly for investments. Relatively few properties have been put on the block because values still are well below their peak and banks are trying to avoid fire sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also underlying the trend: Emerging similarities in global hubs such as London, Paris, New York, and Washington that some U.S. landlords believe they can exploit. Big banks and other multinational companies have offices in major financial centers around the world, and many may be interested in having the same landlords in New York and in Tokyo, some company executives believe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These "global cities" have performed much better in the economic recovery than second-tier cities, drawing an influx of big real-estate investors looking for a stable place to put their money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We own modern office properties in the world's largest, most dynamic, business-forward cities," said Brookfield Office Properties Chief Executive Ric Clark. "The tenants that we deal with are in every one of those cities."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brookfield Office, which owns 70 million square feet of property in North American cities, this year paid $64 million for a 50% interest in a London development project and shelled out $1.4 billion to buy 16 Australian office properties from its controlling shareholder, <span class="companylink">Brookfield Asset Management Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office landlords aren't the first to come up with the idea of establishing a global brand for multinational tenants. Warehouse companies <span class="companylink">ProLogis</span> and <span class="companylink">AMB Property Corp</span>. became Wall Street darlings during the economic boom by becoming one-stop real-estate shops for companies with global logistics needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While warehouse developers can offer global companies uniform construction and warehouse technology, the market demand for a certain office building usually is driven primarily by location, not by the landlord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Vornado, a REIT that owns 35 million square feet of office space in New York and Washington, the bid for ING's real-estate-investment business comes as company executives have expressed frustration with the dearth of good deals available in the U.S. real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has explored off-the-beaten-track ways of making money from the downturn, including a $600 million investment in <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney Co</span>. stock. "We're going around the margins trying to find value," Vornado Chief Executive Michael Fascitelli said at a conference last month.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Industry Sees Friendlier Climate --- Real-Estate Sector Likely to Benefit as GOP Gains in Force</span>
</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan </div><div>900 words</div><div>10 November 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C9</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial real-estate industry stands to benefit from the shifting political power in Washington, as Republicans attempt to roll back some parts of financial regulation and stanch any efforts to raise taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of Tuesday, with eight races remaining undecided, Democrats had lost 60 seats in the House, with Republicans now in control of 239 seats, compared with the Democrats' 188. Democrats still retain a narrow lead in the Senate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate executives said that with the GOP taking control of the House in the next term and stronger numbers in the Senate, the industry's profits will be safer from any attempts to raise taxes. Moreover, Republicans have said they plan to ease some provisions of the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most of my membership . . . on fiscal issues they are probably conservative Democrats. But I think most of them were pretty happy about the results of 2010," said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, a trade association that represents some of the largest developers in New York, including LeFrak Organization, Tishman Speyer Properties and the Fisher family. "The sense is that it will bring the Congress back to the middle a bit, about what needs to be done."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One issue for commercial real-estate professionals is the taxation of "carried interest," or the share of profits paid to the manager of a partnership, typically a hedge fund or private-equity fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Profits reaped by partnerships are taxed as long-term capital gains, at 15%, a much lower rate than corporate income taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That tax law is set to expire in 2011 and revert to the pre-2003 level of 28%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Real Estate Roundtable, a Washington advocacy group, real estate accounts for 46% of the $13.6 trillion in assets held by partnerships in the U.S., and real-estate partnerships, unlike hedge funds, generally risk their own capital, over the course of several years, to build or improve property. If, as some Democrats have pushed for, these fees paid to managers of partnerships and dividends paid to real-estate investors are treated as corporate earnings, it could cut into developers' profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most of our members, where they get caught is, they have a great idea, they get an option to buy, they spend a number of years getting the right zoning, then they get investors, and in return for all that effort, they get a little piece of the action after the investors get paid," said Mr. Spinola. "We think [those profits] should continue to be taxed as capital gains."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. Rep. Sander M. Levin (D., Mich.) had introduced legislation to raise taxes on carried-interest profits, but with last Tuesday's election and the Republican takeover of the House, he will lose his position as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee to Dave Camp, a Republican, also from Michigan, who has been outspoken in his opposition to raising taxes of any kind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican who also serves on the Ways and Means panel and is the ranking Republican of the Joint Economic Committee, said that "efforts to tax traditional real-estate partnerships and tie them in to giant hedge funds" are "dead on arrival in a Republican House."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said in an interview Tuesday that he would use his position on the Joint Economic Committee to focus on commercial real estate by helping ease regulatory pressure on banks that are loath to make new loans or restructure existing loans with troubled borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lack of clarity over the recently passed financial-overhaul bill related to capital-reserve requirements, derivatives trading and other issues could limit bank profits and further stunt lending, said several Republican lawmakers, including Mr. Brady.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brady and other Republicans have vowed to scale back the financial overhaul by softening some of its more than 240 new rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are $1.4 trillion in commercial real-estate loans rolling over in the next three to four years," he said. "If banking regulators don't hit the right balance, you're going to be making the problem even greater."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Levin said through a spokeswoman: "As the new Congress inevitably considers tax reform, including corporate tax rates and other business taxation, I believe the issue of carried interest will be among the items under discussion."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other issues facing the commercial real-estate industry include job growth, so businesses can expand and invest in capital assets like office and industrial buildings. Cutting taxes on businesses or encouraging other measures that stimulate commercial lending could help that, said some analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rep. Scott Garrett, a New Jersey Republican who hopes to become chairman of the House's capital-markets subcommittee, introduced a bill in March to allow the issue and sale of covered bonds, a high-yield debt security backed by residential and commercial mortgages that commonly is used in Europe to finance real-estate projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill passed the House this summer, but wasn't included in the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul bill passed in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Garrett, who couldn't be reached to comment, has said the bonds would help provide banks with lending tools and give consumers more access to credit.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These "global cities" have performed much better in the economic recovery than second-tier cities, drawing an influx of big real-estate investors looking for a stable place to put their money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We own modern office properties in the world's largest, most dynamic, business-forward cities," said Brookfield Office Properties Chief Executive Ric Clark. "The tenants that we deal with are in every one of those cities."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brookfield Office, which owns 70 million square feet of property in North American cities, this year paid $64 million for a 50% interest in a London development project and shelled out $1.4 billion to buy 16 Australian office properties from its controlling shareholder, <span class="companylink">Brookfield Asset Management Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office landlords aren't the first to come up with the idea of establishing a global brand for multinational tenants. Warehouse companies <span class="companylink">ProLogis</span> and <span class="companylink">AMB Property Corp</span>. became Wall Street darlings during the economic boom by becoming one-stop real-estate shops for companies with global logistics needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While warehouse developers can offer global companies uniform construction and warehouse technology, the market demand for a certain office building usually is driven primarily by location, not by the landlord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Vornado, a REIT that owns 35 million square feet of office space in New York and Washington, the bid for ING's real-estate-investment business comes as company executives have expressed frustration with the dearth of good deals available in the U.S. real-estate market. The company has explored off-the-beaten-track ways of making money from the downturn, including a $600 million investment in <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney Co</span>. stock. "We're going around the margins trying to find value," Vornado Chief Executive Michael Fascitelli said at a conference last month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any wealthy mogul with a taste for New York real estate has a favored broker in the city. For Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, it's a 27-year-old junior-college dropout who's yet to meet his famous client.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soly Halabi, who learned English after moving to New York in the early 1990s from Syria, was the broker behind Mr. Slim's two high profile purchases in the city this year: an 11-story Fifth Avenue office building and the Duke Semans mansion across from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also made until-now unreported offers on Mr. Slim's behalf for the Takashimaya building in midtown, <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span>'s skyscraper on Third Avenue and for 1412 Broadway near Times Square. None of these bids was accepted but Mr. Slim's management team apparently liked what it saw of the young broker. Mr. Halabi, who works for a small firm called Venture Capital Properties, says he has represented Mr. Slim in New York since last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Slim, ranked by Forbes as the world's wealthiest person with $53.5 billion, has made other investments in New York landmarks. In 2008, the telecom mogul bought a nearly 7% stake in the New York Times, and he's also a large stakeholder in <span class="companylink">Saks Fifth Avenue</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this appears to be the first time he has shown a big appetite for New York real estate, and Mr. Halabi's activities offer some insight into how the billionaire and his investment team are navigating the city's tricky terrain. Mr. Slim only deals through intermediaries, makes quick decisions and, on at least one occasion, visited a targeted property incognito.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Mr. Halabi, the billionaire is taking a chance on a scrappy, less experienced broker at a small firm. Before representing Mr. Slim, Mr. Halabi's brokering experience was confined largely to small retail deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for Mr. Slim confirmed that Mr. Halabi has been involved in his real estate deals but didn't want to comment further. While Mr. Slim's group talks to a number of brokers, none have shared Mr. Halabi's success, industry participants say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Halabi says he's discreet about dropping his client's name. But potential sellers can often guess when the broker calls with inquiries on behalf of a "wealthy foreign client," people who have received these calls say. Now many sellers are making pitches to Mr. Halabi, hoping to attract an offer from Mr. Slim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Slim and his team are seen as a selling broker's dream. "He acts quickly," one broker put it, "and everyone knows he can pay in cash."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Halabi chalks up his success with Mr. Slim partly to having some mutual friends with Mr. Slim's management team in the Syrian-Mexican business community, though he declines to say more. Both Mr. Halabi and Mr. Slim, the 70-year old son of Lebanese immigrants, speak Arabic and Spanish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Halabi's wife's family is also well-connected in the real estate and retail world, owners of the Rainbow apparel stores in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Halabi has made more than $2.5 million in commissions on the two Slim transactions, industry officials estimate. Mr. Halabi declined to comment on fees. But the broker says he's received interest from other wealthy individuals after people heard about his dealings with Mr. Slim. "It helped a lot," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broker's trophy relationship with Mr. Slim stems from persistence, working connections, and a little luck. Mr. Halabi was born in Syria and was part of that country's Jewish Diaspora in the early 1990s. His family moved to a Syrian community in Flatbush.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He attended Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn, but left during his second year, more eager to join the business world than study it in books. After working briefly for a retail leasing firm, he and veteran broker Ralph Gindi formed a new company in 2005 to develop high-end New York City condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the financial crisis began to erupt, many of the Gindi Group's projects couldn't get financing. Mr. Halabi and his partner went their separate ways. He joined Venture Capital Properties, a 20-person firm that specializes in "off market" transactions, or properties that aren't formally listed for sale. Venture Capital has done more than $1 billion in these kind of transactions over the past few years, the firm says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Halabi began calling officials at Mr. Slim's investment firm, asking to be directed to the real estate investment team and dropping the names of his Mexican business friends. He was surprised to find that Mr. Slim's team was already well versed in Manhattan properties, knowing neighborhoods, addresses, even histories of certain famous buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After his first couple of ideas were shot down, he caught their interest with a bid for <span class="companylink">HSBC</span>'s New York headquarters on Fifth Avenue. Two members of Mr. Slim's team flew to New York to tour the building and consult with Mr. Halabi. He viewed a successful bid as the start of lucrative business with the billionaire. "I was hoping and praying for the offer to get accepted," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was crushed when his bid came below the winning $330 million offer from a company controlled by another foreign billionaire, Israeli businessman Nochi Dankner. But Mr. Halabi had impressed the team enough to get another chance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the start of this year, Mr. Halabi went to Mexico City "to meet face to face" with Mr. Slim's investment group and, he hoped, the man himself. He arrived in the afternoon, met with five officials, chatted about New York investment opportunities, but didn't get closer to their boss than Mr. Slim's nephew. Respecting the billionaire's privacy, he didn't push. "I try not to be too curious," he says. He flew back the next morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After he returned, Mr. Halabi began showing Mr. Slim's team office and retail buildings on Fifth Avenue and at Times Square. Although his bids for Mr. Slim came up short again for the Takashimaya and <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> buildings, the billionaire snagged a Fifth Avenue office building with a $140 million purchase of 417 Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was another Venture Capital off-market transaction. The building also happened to be across the street from the brokers' office and was a site they had been pursuing for clients since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Soly is very savvy," says Richard Baxter, a commercial broker with Jones Lang Lasalle who was the selling broker for the building with his previous firm on the 417 Fifth Ave. transaction. "He really knows how to analyze a deal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal was struck in two weeks, much faster than most transactions of that size. Mr. Slim himself viewed the building but never met with the sellers or their representatives, opting instead to visit the property on his own, say people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Halabi says he can't comment on the Duke Semans mansion transaction because he and his firm are being sued by brokerage firm Brown Harris Stevens. In the suit, Brown Harris Stevens allege the brokerage firm was improperly denied an $880,000 commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What doesn't appear to be in dispute is that the mansion purchase was another rapid-fire deal by Mr. Slim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His firm entered into a contract for the mansion on July 16 and closed five days later for $44 million, public property records show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lawsuit says the contract was signed two days after Mr. Slim learned that the Beaux Arts mansion was for sale.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are in the market for a newly built home, you may be subject to a debated cost called a private-transfer fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has gotten the attention of Congress and could change how homeowners value their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A private transfer fee, also known as a home-resale, capital-recovery or flip fee, is typically 1% of the sales price that a developer or a homeowners association collects at the time of a sale. It generally is directed toward capital improvements in a subdivision or condominium complex and is paid to a homeowners association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a growing number of developers are starting to attach a private-transfer fee to new mortgages to cover the upfront costs of building streets and infrastructure in large residential developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fee, devised by Freehold Capital Partners, a New York-based real-estate consulting firm, kicks in every time a property sells, generally over a 99-year period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American Land Title Association estimates more than $520 billion worth of real estate already has private transfer fee covenants attached.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where Should Money Go?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At issue now is whether such a fee, or pieces of it, should go anywhere but toward the property it is tied to. Lawmakers and opponents, like the National Association of Realtors and the ALTA, call it a scheme to line the pockets of developers and Freehold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph Alderman, managing partner of Freehold, sees the fee as a means of spreading out costly infrastructure expenses and jump-starting half-finished subdivisions hobbled by the housing crisis. Developers can use the money to pay off debt and restart projects, he said. About 18 states have laws regulating the fees, and a bill introduced in Congress in late September calls for prohibiting private transfer fees that go to third parties unaffiliated with the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> is reviewing more than 2,500 comments on a proposal to ban <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and the Federal Home Loan Banks from investing in mortgages on properties subject to these fees even if the money is directed to homeowners associations for capital costs and upkeep. The agency believes the fees will drain liquidity out of home values and will cloud an already complicated title process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The risks and uncertainties for the housing market that come with the use of private transfer-fee covenants do not appear to be counterbalanced by sufficient positive effects," said Edward DeMarco, the FHFA's acting director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a $250,000 home, the transfer fee would be $2,500. According to the Freehold plan, the biggest chunk of that revenue, at 50% to 70%, would go to the developer, and a community nonprofit gets an automatic 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A range of third-party agents would get a piece of the fee, too: 3% to the trustee who collects the fee from the title company and distributes it; 2% to the title company (though some states don't allow title companies to collect such compensation); and 10% to 17% to the brokers who find the developers and set up the covenants, most of whom are Freehold agents now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freehold, which is doing the paperwork on the covenant and doesn't charge any fees, would get the balance of the fee—about 5% to 30%, depending on the size of the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics argue that the costs to pave roads and install sewers should be figured into a newly built residential development project to begin with and that any moves to collect fees for such a long period are predatory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If a developer can't pay for those things upfront, then he shouldn't be doing the project," said Armando Montelongo, a real-estate investor and president of Armando Montelongo Cos., a real-estate investment seminar company and co-host of the cable show "Flip this House."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Coalition to Stop Wall Street Home Resale Fees, a group of Realtors, real-estate investors, housing alliances and consumer advocates, backs the FHFA's proposal, charging that fees paid to third parties "lower a home's equity, depress home prices and complicate the safe, efficient and legal transfer of real estate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Defense of a Fee</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freehold's Mr. Alderman said the fees could make homes more affordable by lowering the price, transactional costs and carrying costs of the home. "A developer at Property A with this transfer fee will have to sell his lots cheaper than the guy across the street who doesn't have them," he said. "Who would pay the same amount of money for a like home when one has a transfer fee and the other one doesn't? No one."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a home without such fees sells for $250,000, a similar home with it should sell for $245,000, he said. With each sale, the price would be adjusted accordingly because of the 1% fee. "No one is forcing a home buyer to do this," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate attorney Rick Akin said he worries home buyers won't realize until too late that a private transfer fee is in the mounds of paperwork at the closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do Disclosures Help?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is another bill in Congress now that aims to insure these covenants are properly disclosed, something Freehold supports. But Mr. Akin doesn't think that holds much water. "A home buyer is so inundated with disclosures when they buy and usually do not know what documents are important," he said. "The fee will probably be just a surprise when they decide to sell."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freehold's Mr. Alderman acknowledges disclosure doesn't always help consumers. "If you have 500 disclosures, you might as well have none," he said. "No one will read them all."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he says the fees will be a wash to consumers. "It's an easy message to say that developers are lining their pockets for a shockingly long time, but it's just not true."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The European Central Bank and the Bank of England both decided to leave their official interest rates unchanged, a day after the U.S.'s Federal Reserve launched a new bid to kick-start the U.S. economy. The ECB's governing council, at its regular monthly meeting, left all of its interest rates untouched, while the BOE's Monetary Policy Committee voted against an immediate expansion of its bond purchasing program and also left its key interest rate unchanged.[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB40001424052748703805704575594083219715888.html]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said the U.S. had no other choice but to boost its fledgling economic growth through a fresh round of monetary easing, but she cautioned that the move would put upward pressure on the euro. Lagarde said the move would push the dollar lower against the euro and that the U.S. monetary easing decision highlights the need for global coordination on monetary policies.[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB40001424052748703805704575594070269373054.html]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro zone's private-sector output growth eased to its weakest level for eight months in October as a slowdown in services activity offset a pickup in manufacturing, a survey said. The results are consistent with quarterly economic growth in the currency area easing to around 0.3% from around 0.6% in the third quarter and a peak of 1% in the second, survey provider Markit said. As in previous months, there was a sharp divergence in national performances, with Germany posting robust growth, France suffering a sharp slowdown due to strikes, modest expansions in Italy and Ireland, and fresh contractions in Spain and Greece. Euro-zone producer prices rose again in September, with the annual increase the biggest in almost two years, boosted by stronger output across the board, official data showed. Producer prices rose 0.3% on a month-to-month basis in September and were 4.2% higher from a year earlier. The annual gain was the largest since October 2008 when prices were 6.1% higher, the European Union's statistics agency Eurostat said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The European Union proposed new privacy rights for citizens sharing personal data with websites such as Facebook and Google—threatening to heighten tensions between European regulators on the one hand and U.S. tech companies and a fast-growing online advertising industry on the other. Both Google and Facebook have come under fire in the EU this year for collecting personal data without authorization.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.K. house prices recovered slightly in October after September's record slump, but annual growth slowed again while the three-monthly measure declined again and by the steepest amount in over a year, a survey reported. The Halifax house price index showed that house prices rose 1.8% from a month earlier and by 1.2% compared with October 2009. The year-to-year increase was the lowest since a 1.1% rise in December last year. In September, house prices slumped a record 3.7% from August and were 2.6% higher on the year. Halifax originally reported house prices fell 3.6% on the month in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cancellation of one of the two aircraft carriers on order for the U.K.'s armed forces would have resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs and ended Britain's capability in complex warships, defense contractor BAE Systems warned Prime Minister David Cameron two weeks before he delivered the government's strategic defense and security review. In a letter to Cameron dated Oct. 5 and marked "in strict confidence," BAE Systems Chief Executive Ian King laid out in stark terms the cost of scrapping aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales. King said cancellation would have meant that production in all BAE Systems shipyards would cease at the end of 2012, with no further production work planned until steel was due to be cut on a new frigate program in 2016.[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB40001424052748703805704575594440335553292.html]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Britain and Ireland announced that their expert panel monitoring Northern Ireland's rival paramilitary groups will be shut down because the British territory has forged a stable Catholic-Protestant government. The Independent Monitoring Commission has provided reports since 2004 analyzing the violence of Irish Republican Army factions and their enemies in anti-Catholic gangs. Britain and Ireland published the commission's latest report and announced the work is finished now. Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson said he has asked the experts to produce a final report on "lessons learned," then their offices in Dublin and Belfast will be closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Britain's defense ministry says two lawmakers from Northern Ireland have been barred from visiting troops in Afghanistan until they can find flak jackets big enough to fit them.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of insuring Ireland's government debt against the risk of default hit a record for the fourth consecutive day, underscoring how the country's banking and economic problems show few signs of abating anytime soon.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Italy, a prominent cardinal lashed out at Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's lifestyle, bringing the country's Roman Catholic Church into the fray at a time of increasing political uncertainty. The cardinal's interview marks the first time a well-known Italian prelate has publicly weighed in on Berlusconi's openly declared penchant for hosting parties with young women at his home. Public statements by Catholic officials are carefully watched, because the church influences a large swath of Italy's voters.[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB40001424052748703805704575594411187818820.html]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greek police said they intercepted and conducted a controlled detonation of a package addressed to the French embassy that they rightly suspected to be booby trapped, causing traffic tie-ups in Athens. The intercepted package was posted Monday from an Athens suburb with the offices of the Archbishop of Athens written as a false return address, police said. It contained a book whose pages were carved out and filled with a low quantity of gun powder. The police bomb squad was also called by the local <span class="companylink">United Parcel Service</span> to examine 20 packages Thursday. None appeared to be dangerous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Turkey, a splinter group of the Kurdish Workers' Party claimed responsibility for a weekend suicide bombing in central Istanbul that killed the bomber and wounded 32 others, half of them police.

Fannie and Freddie have already cost U.S. taxpayers nearly $134 billion, but S&amp;P analysts said the government could ultimately be forced to inject $280 billion into the firms because of a slowdown in the housing market.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. Rep. Spencer Bachus, the Alabama Republican competing for the reins of the House Financial Services Committee, warned regulators not to "rigidly" implement a new rule aimed at curbing banks' risk-taking ability, saying it will impose "substantial costs" on the economy. Bachus's opposition to the Volcker rule, named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker who also is an Obama administration adviser, isn't new but his comments have taken on importance given the committee's role in overseeing many of the regulators who will define its scope. Already, some Republican lawmakers are suggesting they will seek to influence the rules that must be written as part of the financial-regulatory overhaul passed this year through frequent oversight of regulators and by potentially squeezing agency budgets. The Volcker rule sought to prevent banks from putting their capital at risk by prohibiting proprietary trading and banning some relationships with hedge funds and private-equity funds.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate of Mr. Jones, 56, the billionaire head of <span class="companylink">Tudor Investment Corp</span>., is partially wetland and has an equestrian complex, sports complex and several ponds. The main, Adirondack-style house of 14,000 square feet has 10 bedrooms, a great room with a wall of glass, a yoga studio and a room for decoys, according to the listing. There are two guest houses. Michael Rankin and Russell Firestone of TTR Sotheby's International Realty share the listing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 44-acre Aspen, Colo., estate has sold for $31.5 million, what brokers say is a record price for the area this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller of the property, left, was Bob Zangrillo, founder of private-equity firm Z Capital. For the last several years, Mr. Zangrillo was asking $47.5 million, a price that included furniture and equipment. The property sold unfurnished and has a 15,000-square-foot stone mansion and caretaker's apartment, and a horse stable. The buyer through a limited liability company was Chris Reyes of Chicago-based food and beer distributor <span class="companylink">Reyes Holdings</span>. Joshua Saslove of Joshua &amp; Co. had the listing, and Joseph Krabacher represented Mr. Zangrillo. Steven Shane of SDS Real Estate represented the buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price beats the local record set this year by hedge-fund manager John Paulson, who paid $24.5 million in June for an 8.4-acre estate completed in 2009. There's a roughly 13,000-square-foot stone mansion with a 35-foot wall of glass that disappears, a guest house, two lakes and a sandy beach.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller is Jim Kirk, founder of rental-equipment company NationsRent, who is looking to downsize. Mr. Kirk bought the property in the early 1980s for around $10 million. It's one of the few large ranches in the area and is home to wildlife. There's a four-bedroom main house, a guest home, hiking trails and miles of paved road. Bill McDavid of Hall &amp; Hall has the listing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, September condominium sales in Connecticut dropped 23% to their lowest level in more than 20 years, according to Warren Group, a real-estate data firm. and author of the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year-to-date home sales through September, buoyed by the federal home-buyer tax credit, totaled 18,951, up 10.1% over the year-earlier period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The tax credit loaded sales into the first half of the year and when it expired, the momentum did not carry forward," said Warren Group CEO Timothy Warren. "Now there are fewer people ready to make home purchases in the second half of the year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for single-family homes in Connecticut rose about 2% to $245,000 in September from the month a year earlier. The year-to-date median home price is $250,000, up from $244,000 in the year-earlier period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo median prices also posted a slight increase of less than 1% to $183,500 in September from the same month last year. The year-to-date median condo price through September inched up more than 2% to $181,000 from the same period last year.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jennifer Waters </div><div>864 words</div><div>5 November 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C11</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are in the market for a newly built home, you may be subject to a debated cost called a private-transfer fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has gotten the attention of Congress and could change how homeowners value their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A private transfer fee, also known as a home-resale, capital-recovery or flip fee, is typically 1% of the sales price that a developer or a homeowners association collects at the time of a sale. It generally is directed toward capital improvements in a subdivision or condominium complex and is paid to a homeowners association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a growing number of developers are starting to attach a private-transfer fee to new mortgages to cover the upfront costs of building streets and infrastructure in large residential developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fee, devised by Freehold Capital Partners, a New York-based real-estate consulting firm, kicks in every time a property sells, generally over a 99-year period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American Land Title Association estimates more than $520 billion worth of real estate already has private transfer fee covenants attached.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At issue now is whether such a fee, or pieces of it, should go anywhere but toward the property it is tied to. Lawmakers and opponents, like the National Association of Realtors and the ALTA, call it a way to line the pockets of developers and Freehold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph Alderman, managing partner of Freehold, sees the fee as a means of spreading out costly infrastructure expenses and jump-starting half-finished subdivisions hobbled by the housing crisis. Developers can use the money to pay off debt and restart projects, he said. About 18 states have laws regulating the fees, and a bill introduced in Congress in late September calls for prohibiting private transfer fees that go to third parties unaffiliated with the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> is reviewing more than 2,500 comments on a proposal to ban <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and the Federal Home Loan Banks from investing in mortgages on properties subject to these fees even if the money is directed to homeowners associations for capital costs and upkeep. The agency believes the fees will drain liquidity out of home values and will cloud an already complicated title process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The risks and uncertainties for the housing market that come with the use of private transfer-fee covenants do not appear to be counterbalanced by sufficient positive effects," said Edward DeMarco, the FHFA's acting director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a $250,000 home, the transfer fee would be $2,500. According to the Freehold plan, the biggest chunk of that revenue, at 50% to 70%, would go to the developer, and a community nonprofit gets an automatic 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A range of third-party agents would get a piece of the fee, too: 3% to the trustee who collects the fee from the title company and distributes it; 2% to the title company (though some states don't allow title companies to collect such compensation); and 10% to 17% to the brokers who find the developers and set up the covenants, most of whom are Freehold agents now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freehold, which is doing the paperwork on the covenant and doesn't charge any fees, would get the balance of the fee -- about 5% to 30%, depending on the size of the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics argue that the costs to pave roads and install sewers should be figured into a newly built residential development project to begin with and that any moves to collect fees for such a long period are predatory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If a developer can't pay for those things upfront, then he shouldn't be doing the project," said Armando Montelongo, a real-estate investor and president of Armando Montelongo Cos., a real-estate investment seminar company and co-host of the cable show "Flip this House."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Coalition to Stop Wall Street Home Resale Fees, a group of Realtors, real-estate investors, housing alliances and consumer advocates, backs the FHFA's proposal, charging that fees paid to third parties "lower a home's equity, depress home prices and complicate the safe, efficient and legal transfer of real estate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freehold's Mr. Alderman said the fees could make homes more affordable by lowering the price, transactional costs and carrying costs of the home. "A developer at Property A with this transfer fee will have to sell his lots cheaper than the guy across the street who doesn't have them," he said. "Who would pay the same amount of money for a like home when one has a transfer fee and the other one doesn't? No one."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a home without such fees sells for $250,000, a similar home with it should sell for $245,000, he said. With each sale, the price would be adjusted accordingly because of the 1% fee. "No one is forcing a home buyer to do this," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate attorney Rick Akin said he worries home buyers won't realize until too late that a private transfer fee is in the mounds of paperwork at the closing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Tudor Jones Lists</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maryland Estate for $30 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hedge-fund pioneer Paul Tudor Jones is asking $30 million for his 6,250-acre hunting retreat on Maryland's eastern shore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate of Mr. Jones, 56, the billionaire head of <span class="companylink">Tudor Investment Corp</span>., is partially wetland and has an equestrian complex, sports complex and several ponds. The main, Adirondack-style house of 14,000 square feet has 10 bedrooms, a great room with a wall of glass, a yoga studio and a room for decoys, according to the listing. There are two guest houses. Michael Rankin and Russell Firestone of TTR Sotheby's International Realty share the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My family and I have greatly enjoyed the fantastic beauty of the farm," said Mr. Jones through a spokesman, adding they hoped the buyer would continue the conservation efforts currently in practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aspen Mountain Property</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sells for $31.5 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 44-acre Aspen, Colo., estate has sold for $31.5 million, what brokers say is a record price for the area this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller of the property, above, was Bob Zangrillo, founder of private-equity firm Z Capital. For the last several years, Mr. Zangrillo was asking $47.5 million, a price that included furniture and equipment. The property sold unfurnished and has a 15,000-square-foot stone mansion and caretaker's apartment, and a horse stable. The buyer through a limited liability company was Chris Reyes of Chicago-based food and beer distributor <span class="companylink">Reyes Holdings</span>. Joshua Saslove of Joshua &amp; Co. had the listing, and Joseph Krabacher represented Mr. Zangrillo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price beats the local record set this year by hedge-fund manager John Paulson, who paid $24.5 million in June for an 8.4-acre estate completed in 2009. There's a roughly 13,000-square-foot stone mansion with a 35-foot wall of glass that disappears, a guest house, two lakes and a sandy beach. Brian Hazen of Mason Morse represented Mr. Paulson and Bob Bowden Properties' Bob and Renee Bowden, who built the spec home with other investors, also had the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carmel Valley Ranch</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cuts Price 35% to $21.5 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After nearly four years on the market at $33 million, a roughly 6,500-acre Carmel Valley, Calif. ranch has seen its asking price cut 35% to $21.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller is Jim Kirk, founder of rental-equipment company NationsRent, who is looking to downsize. Mr. Kirk bought the property in the early 1980s for around $10 million. It's one of the few large ranches in the area and is home to wildlife. There's a four-bedroom main house, a guest home, hiking trails and miles of paved road. Bill McDavid of Hall &amp; Hall has the listing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the world's biggest real-estate investors have lost their gumption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having been hammered by boom-era plays in risky "opportunity" funds that speculated in new developments, they now are flocking to "core" funds that generally feature low leverage, well-leased buildings and stable returns. The trend has effectively split the real-estate market: Values of mature, well-performing properties are increasing, while turnaround situations continue to suffer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move to the "core" already is under way at the <span class="companylink">California Public Employees' Retirement System</span>, or Calpers. It recently sold its stake in two opportunistic funds investing in residential real estate to <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span>. The deal for the funds, managed by the Los Angeles firm CityView, was valued at $225 million including debt and equity, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The funds include about two dozen assets, including raw land, single-family houses and condos in nine states. CityView, which was founded by a former head of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Henry Cisneros, has been a longtime Calpers real-estate partner focused on urban real-estate projects in cities such as Los Angeles, Dallas and Denver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the downturn, Calpers was burned by illiquid investments in land and single-family housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were aware that Calpers was moving away from opportunistic residential investments," said CityView Chief Executive Sean Burton in an interview. "We went out and found Blackstone as a new partner who really understands residential real estate and has the vision and the capital to see the investment through." CityView remains a Calpers real-estate adviser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such changes haven't been lost on Wall Street, which is revamping its menu of real-estate investments. <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. is launching a new business to focus on less-risky property deals, after its Whitehall family of opportunity funds suffered losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new business, housed in Goldman's asset-management arm, is trying to raise money from pension funds and other investors to acquire buildings with healthy tenant rosters and lower debt levels. Goldman recently tapped Jeff Barclay, a veteran "core" fund manager at ING Clarion to lead the effort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, some existing core real-estate funds like the one run by <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. have seen a turnaround. At one point during the financial crisis, investors hit the $11.5 billion <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> fund, the biggest of its kind, with redemption requests totaling as much as $1.8 billion. It has raised an additional $3 billion from investors this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the changes also are upending the pay of top real-estate fund managers. During the boom years, opportunity-fund managers earned enormous "promote" fees that were tied to price appreciation of properties when sold. It was not unheard of for a manager of a $1 billion opportunity fund to earn tens of millions of dollars in one year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Managers of core funds are on a far different trajectory. They collect fees from rental income and assets under management, which are much more limited. A manager of a $1 billion core fund might make about $1 million annually, said investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The demand for core properties comes at time that values are rising for buildings leased on a long-term basis by credit-worthy tenants. Once scoffed at, 6% annual returns look attractive when 10-year government bonds are yielding 2.66%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> core fund has spent $1.2 billion this year acquiring properties. It paid $234 million for the three-building, 600,000-square-foot Advanta Office Commons in Bellevue, Wash., leased entirely to <span class="companylink">Microsoft Corp</span>. It also paid $66 million for the Equinox Apartments, a recently completed 204-unit apartment building in Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Core property prices are rising. Houston-based Hines recently sold a near-fully leased office tower at 300 North LaSalle St. in Chicago to KBS Realty Advisors Cos., a Newport Beach, Calif., money manger for pensions and sovereign-wealth funds. The price was a record for Chicago: $655 million, or about $500 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, buildings with high vacancies look toxic to many institutional investors. With the economy weak, rental rates anemic and the number of defaults and foreclosures rising, the value of these properties is likely to keep falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The response was tepid last year when <span class="companylink">Macquarie Office Trust</span>, an Australian real-estate investment trust, now known as <span class="companylink">Charter Hall Office REIT</span>, put One California Plaza in downtown Los Angeles on the block. Its vacancy rate was more than 20%, and the building never was sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate yields are attractive to pension funds because they are under pressure to keep hitting what many critics said are unrealistically high-return expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate's lure proved a little too strong in recent years. For the past 15 years, opportunistic property funds have produced a gross return of 10.8%, according to Townsend Group, compared with 7.4% by core U.S. funds and 12.7% of all types of real-estate funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pension funds changing their real-estate investment strategy include the $132.2 billion <span class="companylink">California State Teachers' Retirement System</span>, known as <span class="companylink">Calstrs</span>. It is looking to increase its allocation to core property funds to 50% from 35%, while decreasing its allocation to 50% from 65% to the riskier funds that borrow more than 50 cents for every dollar of asset, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Calstrs</span> has been moving more assets from opportunistic to core investments to "reduce its volatility and level of risk" since last September, a spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other pension funds are following suit. According to Townsend, a large U.S. real-estate adviser to institutional investors, core property funds have attracted a total of $7.2 billion in capital this year. While some 405 higher-risk funds are trying to raise more than $120 billion, only $6 billion of that targeted amount has been closed year to date, Townsend's data show. The successful few include funds run by distressed specialists <span class="companylink">Lone Star Funds</span> and <span class="companylink">Angelo, Gordon &amp; Co</span>., according to people familiar with the matter.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sara Murray </div><div>702 words</div><div>2 November 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. manufacturing picked up steam last month, aided by rising exports and a surge in new orders that suggests the factory sector will continue to bolster growth through the rest of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management's index of overall manufacturing activity, based on surveys of purchasing managers, rose to 56.9 in October from 54.4 the month before. Any number over 50 points to expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest reading marks the 15th month in a row the index has pointed toward growth and comes as the Federal Reserve is poised to announce this week a new round of bond-buying to lower long-term interest rates in the hopes of speeding growth in the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report released Monday showed consumer spending rose only slightly ahead of the holiday season. Personal incomes declined, as payrolls fell for government workers and those at goods-producing companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing report showed production ramping up in a wide range of industries, including machinery and apparel. A subindex in the report that tracks exports climbed to 60.5 last month from 54.5 in September, partly helped by the weak U.S. dollar. Imports declined by five points to 51.5. The employment index ticked up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand is booming at <span class="companylink">Bremen Castings Inc</span>., a foundry and machining company in Bremen, Ind. Sales are up 49% so far this year and the manufacturer has been adding employees, said James L. Brown, the company's president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bremen also has spent some $4.2 million this year to beef up facilities and equipment. "You've got the cash and you've got the bank behind you," said Mr. Brown, "why not?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Brown is trying to balance aggressive moves with caution because it isn't clear how long the demand spree will last, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're booked up until Christmas, and I'm really not looking much further out than that," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In past years, employees took the week of Christmas off, but they will take just the holiday off this year to keep up with demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price pressures popped up in raw materials last month, and some companies with heavy ties to commodities are feeling the pinch. <span class="companylink">Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co</span>. said Monday that its earnings fell despite stronger demand because of rising raw-material costs. The Findlay, Ohio, company's third-quarter earnings fell 4.8% even as sales were up 10% from the same time a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For demand to continue rising, the economy needs to add jobs so Americans can keep spending. Consumer spending rose just 0.2% in September, the Commerce Department said Monday, compared with a 0.5% increase the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lackluster spending is tied to tight budgets. With the unemployment rate at 9.6% and high joblessness expected for a while Americans are uneasy. And many families are increasingly reliant on government benefits to get by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Waning support from emergency unemployment insurance pulled personal incomes down by 0.1% in September. Contributions from jobless benefits fell by $25.5 billion at an annual rate following a $20.5 billion boost in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a little disappointing," John Ryding, an RDQ Economics analyst said of the report. "It really speaks to the need to get jobs going to start putting more income into household pockets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As consumers earned less and spent more, the savings rate declined to 5.3% in September from 5.6% a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of inflation in the spending report showed little threat of price increases in the overall economy. The core price index for personal consumption expenditures, which strips out volatile food and energy prices and is watched closely by the Fed, was flat in September and was up just 1.2% for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report Monday showed construction spending increased 0.5% in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $801.7 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gain was largely from public construction, which rose, as private construction remained flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending is still 10.4% below its level from the same time last year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SYDNEY—Amid the gloom hanging over the U.S. housing market, Australia continues to defy critics who say one of the world's few property hot spots is overdue for a correction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another test will come at the landmark Sydney Opera House on Monday, when real-estate agency Ray White Ltd. holds an auction of 11 luxury dwellings, 10 in New South Wales, one in Queensland. The firm hopes the iconic venue will help persuade the invited bidders, mainly Asian, to snap up the properties, some for as much as 10 million Australian dollars (US$9.9 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Compared with the U.S., our market has not been hit by an atomic bomb," said Brian White, chairman of Ray White, which last year sold A$23 billion of mostly residential and commercial property in Australia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australian real-estate agencies are drawing Russian and Chinese investors with online advertisements showing rooftop pools and panoramic harbor views. Demand is so strong that in April the government moved to cool what it believed was an overheating in foreign real-estate investment by tightening restrictions. Mr. White is quick to dismiss fears that Sydney or other booming Australian cities like Melbourne could be heading for a crash: "Branded" developments in Australia—such as Hilton condominiums on the Gold Coast—will always appeal to wealthy foreign investors, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign demand isn't the only engine. Home sales are propped up by an economy that the International Monetary Fund forecasts will expand by 3.5% in 2011, driven by China's demand for its vast reserves of coal and iron ore. Property enthusiasm is running high. Organizers said 10,000 people gathered at the Sydney Home Buyer and Property Investors Show last week to hear expert advice on how to cash in. Among those in attendance was property investor and farmer Paul Morton—he tends 30,000 ducks on his place in New South Wales—who said he isn't concerned that prices may be overdone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Property has been a real good investment for me," said Mr. Morton, who wants to add to his existing portfolio of three rental properties in the Sydney area. "No reason to think that will change."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gerard Minack, chief Australian economist at investment bank <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, sees it differently. "The economics of these prices simply don't add up," he said. "You're now buying an asset where the yield doesn't even cover the financing cost." And the IMF's latest assessment of the Australian economy warns that real-estate prices could be heading for a 15% correction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs of overheating. Prices in Australia have quadrupled in a little more than 20 years, and the average home in Sydney now costs A$200,000 more than its counterpart in greater New York and nearly as much as in Honolulu or San Jose, Calif., according to a calculation from data drawn from the National Association of Realtors in the U.S. and the Real Estate Institute of Australia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Minack says buyers are in some cases paying as much as 40% above fair value to gain a foothold on the property ladder. Average Australians are increasingly being priced out. According to an international housing-affordability survey, from the Wendell Cox Consultancy, the country has the highest ratio of home prices to gross median household income in the world. And home loans, already among the most expensive in the Group of 20 industrial and developing nations, are set to become costlier following the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of Australia</span>'s 0.25-percentage-point increase in its key cash rate on Tuesday, to 4.75%. <span class="companylink">Commonwealth Bank of Australia</span> quickly raised its variable mortgage rates 0.45 percentage point to 7.81%, and the country's three other large banks are weighing similar increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tanya Butorac, a 30-year-old receptionist from the outlying Sydney neighborhood of Glenfield, is one of many first-time buyers feeling the pinch of the real-estate boom. She scraped together a mortgage deposit last year to buy a small townhouse for A$358,000 but now frets every month over whether the central bank will raise borrowing rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The chance that my property might be worth less to me now than what I paid for it is a very scary prospect," said Ms. Butorac, who is cutting down on electricity and water use in her home to make ends meet. "Paying off a Sydney mortgage is very difficult."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most economists agree that a housing slump won't derail Australia's resources-driven economy, opinion is divided on the impact on the balance sheets of the country's banks. Commonwealth, <span class="companylink">National Australia Bank Ltd</span>., <span class="companylink">Westpac Banking Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd</span>. dominate the local-mortgage writing industry, holding more than three-quarters of the country's home loans on their books. They also account for a quarter of the market value of the benchmark S&amp;P ASX-200 stock index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They sre touchy on the subject. Commonwealth, which has a mortgage book of about A$290 billion, recently sent a team of economists on an overseas tour to convince worried foreign institutional clients that a crash in prices isn't likely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a legit concern given what's happened in other countries, but we just think Australia is a little different," said Michael Blythe, chief economist at Commonwealth Bank in Sydney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blythe cites the demand produced by 2% annual population growth, which exceeds that of both China and the U.S., and strict lending terms that preclude the kind of subprime-mortgage collapse that continues to weigh on U.S. growth. Such mortgages accounted for just 0.3% of all loans outstanding in June, down from an already small 0.8% in March 2008, according to the central bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority, the government's bank regulator, conducted a stress test of Australia's 20 largest banks this year under a scenario of a severe economic downturn, including a 25% drop in house prices. It concluded that none would collapse.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charity begins at home. Until the bust, home-improvement companies profited from the kindness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans tend to spend generously on their homes when real-estate prices rise, partly because they can see a return on those investments. Indeed, Greg Melich of ISI Group points out a close correlation between home prices and the average price per item bought at <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> and <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> over the past several years. So it was no real surprise that shoppers focused on cheaper home improvements when real-estate valuations were sliding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem now is that many Americans are unlikely to expect a return on home improvements for a while. While home prices have risen slightly in recent months, the glut of housing supply could limit further gains. A <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> survey in October found that a record 96% of consumers think it is a "bad time" to sell their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors should beware companies that sell high-end improvements. While <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> and <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> sell items across a wide price range, home-improvement maker <span class="companylink">Masco</span> concentrates on pricier items like cabinets and faucets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Masco</span>'s own recent performance reflects the struggle. Cabinet sales, which account for about 20% of revenue, have continued to tumble in recent quarters. One of its strongest sellers has been "decorative architectural products." That category consists mainly of paint, which, unlike cabinetry, is probably needed every few years even if homes aren't sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Masco</span> shares trade at 22 times next year's consensus earnings. At that price, the shares look like a bold bet on a steady upturn in home prices.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooklyn real-estate mogul Rubin Schron is fighting his former lawyer for control of a national nursing-home company in a battle that pits one of the city's largest and most secretive landlords against an attorney who was a trusted adviser and business partner for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dispute shines a rare spotlight on Mr. Schron, 72 years old, who has largely avoided the public eye despite building up an empire of skyscrapers, warehouses and apartment complexes worth billions of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His holdings include the Woolworth Building downtown, once the world's tallest; tens of thousands of apartment units in Brooklyn, Staten Island, and Queens, including a portfolio acquired from the family of Donald Trump; and millions of square feet of industrial space on the Brooklyn waterfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The focal point of the fight is SavaSeniorCare, an Atlanta-based nursing-home chain with 18,000 patients and 20,000 employees that Mr. Schron says he has the right to buy for $100 million -- far less than what it's worth -- from his former lawyer, Leonard Grunstein, and a banker, Murray Forman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Grunstein insists the option isn't valid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the rift between Messrs. Schron and Grunstein runs deeper. Mr. Grunstein first represented Mr. Schron in the 1980s, according to court filings. Today the two sides can't even seem to agree on whether they used to be friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schron's complaint says that the relationship between the two men "eventually extended beyond business" and that "Grunstein attended the weddings of a number of Schron's children."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a court document, however, Mr. Grunstein and other defendants said they "admit that Schron and Grunstein attended some events together, and state that Schron and Grunstein were not friends."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schron in court filings has said that their relationship ruptured after he realized that Mr. Grunstein's interests in their real-estate deals were running counter to his own. Mr. Grunstein says he arranged some of Mr. Schron's most lucrative acquisitions and that his former client is now trying to take a bigger piece of the pie than he's entitled to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for Mr. Schron said Mr. Grunstein "betrayed his personal and fiduciary duty to his client over a period of many years." A spokesman for Messrs. Grunstein and Forman referred to the case as "nothing more than a money grab by Mr. Schron."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Grunstein's wife Chana Grunstein said of Mr. Schron: "My husband made him not a millionaire, a billionaire . . . and he's not happy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schron got his start in real estate on the Lower East Side in the years after World War II. After one of Mr. Schron's brothers died of war-related injuries, the family used a $5,000 government payment to buy a small apartment building on Delancey Street, which Mr. Schron and his siblings helped maintain, according to a person close to Mr. Schron.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1960s and 1970s, as banks foreclosed on vacant apartment buildings, Mr. Schron became a property manager, a receiver and finally an owner. In 1967 Mr. Schron started Cammeby's International Group, the company through which Mr. Schron did many of his deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2007, Mr. Schron had $1.5 billion in equity in real-estate and health-care assets, according to a prospectus that year for a securitized loan on a property in which Mr. Schron is a partner -- 6 million square feet of industrial space on the Brooklyn waterfront known as Bush Terminal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he has stayed out of the limelight. "He's a major, major, low-profile player," says developer Gary Barnett, who has done at least one deal with Mr. Schron.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, Mr. Schron and Matthew Bronfman acquired a controlling stake in <span class="companylink">Israel Discount Bank Ltd</span>., one of the largest banks in Israel. He also owns numerous buildings on downtown Broadway, including 32, 39, 42, 179, 291 and 360 Broadway, according to the person close to Mr. Schron.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This guy's got so much money he doesn't know what to do with all of that money," says Steve Witkoff, with whom Mr. Schron owns the Woolworth Building. "I don't think he cares much about being on the Real Estate Board and going to Real Estate Board dinners."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal for the nursing-home chain was funded by Mr. Schron and devised by Messrs. Grunstein and Forman, according to court filings by both sides. Like other buyouts of big nursing home companies in the mid-2000s, the deal essentially split the chain, a publicly traded company called <span class="companylink">Mariner Health Care</span>, into two pieces: one operated the facilities and paid rent to the other, which owned the real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schron owned the real estate company; Messrs. Grunstein and Forman eventually took control of the operating company, Sava, which paid rent to Mr. Schron for the right to operate those homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schron claims in his complaint that the deal gave him the option to buy the operating company for $100 million -- well below its real value -- but that Mr. Grunstein later told him the option was worthless and that he could use it "as toilet paper."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Grunstein in court papers has denied making the toilet-paper comparison and argued that the purchase option isn't valid because it was meant to be collateral for a loan that Mr. Schron never made. The case is still making its way through New York State Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Complicating the case is the tangled relationship between Mr. Schron and Mr. Grunstein, a partner in the New York office of <span class="companylink">Troutman Sanders LLP</span> who has been on leave from the Atlanta-based law firm since last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schron says in court papers that Mr. Grunstein first represented him in the 1980s, and that Mr. Schron by the 1990s was speaking to Mr. Grunstein almost every day and relying on him for advice on most of his real-estate deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schron "would not turn the block without talking to my husband," Mrs. Grunstein said in an interview. "They wouldn't even shake hands, they were hugging and kissing all the time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Grunstein's side says that Mr. Schron had numerous other lawyers as well and that the nursing-home deal, which the lawyer helped devise, enriched Mr. Schron to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As it stands today, Mr. Schron is getting paid $70 million in annual rent after debt service and his overall benefit from the deal, including appreciation, is approximately $400 million," the spokesman for Messrs. Grunstein and Forman said. "It's all aboutthe money for Mr. Schron who has already reaped windfall profits as a result of the favorable interest and lending environment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spokesman also said that Mr. Schron demanded a steep rent increase that Messrs. Grunstein and Forman rejected because it would have affected patient care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for Mr. Schron said he had discussed "a small increase" with Mr. Grunstein and that the figures for how much Mr. Schron has made from the deal are "blatantly wrong" in part because they ignore "enormous ongoing costs" to Mr. Schron. The spokesman also said the current dispute won't have any impact on Sava's health-care operations. Sava representatives didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dispute is also deeply personal. Mr. Schron says he fired Mr. Grunstein in 2009 after years of "abuse and intimidation." "Grunstein routinely shouted at, cursed, and threatened Schron, often in the presence of Schron's children," Mr. Schron's complaint says. Mr. Grunstein, in a court filing, denied those allegations.</p>

He also owns numerous buildings on downtown Broadway, including 32, 39, 42, 179, 291 and 360 Broadway, according to the person close to Mr. Schron.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This guy's got so much money he doesn't know what to do with all of that money," says Steve Witkoff, with whom Mr. Schron owns the Woolworth Building. "I don't think he cares much about being on the Real Estate Board and going to Real Estate Board dinners."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal for the nursing-home chain was funded by Mr. Schron and devised by Messrs. Grunstein and Forman, according to court filings by both sides. Like other buyouts of big nursing home companies in the mid-2000s, the deal essentially split the chain, a publicly traded company called <span class="companylink">Mariner Health Care</span>, into two pieces: one operated the facilities and paid rent to the other, which owned the real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schron owned the real estate company; Messrs. Grunstein and Forman eventually took control of the operating company, Sava, which paid rent to Mr. Schron for the right to operate those homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schron claims in his complaint that the deal gave him the option to buy the operating company for $100 million—well below its real value—but that Mr. Grunstein later told him the option was worthless and that he could use it "as toilet paper."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Grunstein in court papers has denied making the toilet-paper comparison and argued that the purchase option isn't valid because it was meant to be collateral for a loan that Mr. Schron never made. The case is still making its way through New York State Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Complicating the case is the tangled relationship between Mr. Schron and Mr. Grunstein, a partner in the New York office of <span class="companylink">Troutman Sanders LLP</span> who has been on leave from the Atlanta-based law firm since last year. Troutman has filed claims in court for $1.5 million in attorneys' fees it says are owed to the firm by Mr. Schron.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schron, in his complaint, said that many of the Troutman invoices are bogus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schron says in court papers that Mr. Grunstein first represented him in the 1980s, and that Mr. Schron by the 1990s was speaking to Mr. Grunstein almost every day and relying on him for advice on most of his real-estate deals. Mr. Schron "would not turn the block without talking to my husband," Mrs. Grunstein said in an interview. "They wouldn't even shake hands, they were hugging and kissing all the time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Grunstein's side says that Mr. Schron had numerous other lawyers as well and that the nursing-home deal, which the lawyer helped devise, enriched Mr. Schron to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As it stands today, Mr. Schron is getting paid $70 million in annual rent after debt service and his overall benefit from the deal, including appreciation, is approximately $400 million," the spokesman for Messrs. Grunstein and Forman said. "It's all about&nbsp;the money for Mr. Schron who has already reaped windfall profits as a result of the favorable interest and lending environment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spokesman also said that Mr. Schron demanded a steep rent increase that Messrs. Grunstein and Forman rejected because it would have affected patient care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for Mr. Schron said he had discussed "a small increase" with Mr. Grunstein and that the figures for how much Mr. Schron has made from the deal are "blatantly wrong" in part because they ignore "enormous ongoing costs" to Mr. Schron. The spokesman also said the current dispute won't have any impact on Sava's health-care operations. Sava representatives didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dispute is also deeply personal. Mr. Schron says he fired Mr. Grunstein in 2009 after years of "abuse and intimidation." "Grunstein routinely shouted at, cursed, and threatened Schron, often in the presence of Schron's children," Mr. Schron's complaint says. Mr. Grunstein, in a court filing, denied those allegations.</p>
