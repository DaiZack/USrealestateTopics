<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employers added a disappointing 110,000 jobs in March, the fewest since July and a big drop from 243,000 in February, the Labor Department reported. Meanwhile, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 5.2% in March from 5.4% in February.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists believe that last month's lackluster performance in payroll growth is an indication of businesses turning more cautious in the face of profit pressures and another spike in energy prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department reported that construction spending increased 0.4% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.05 trillion. In addition, the Institute for Supply Management, which polls purchasing agents at more than 400 industrial companies, said its index of manufacturing activity was relatively unchanged at 55.2 in March. The new-orders index ticked higher to 57.1 from 55.8, while the employment gauge slipped to 53.3 from 57.4.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Index readings above 50 indicate the sector is expanding. The March number represents the 22nd consecutive month of manufacturing growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM also reported its nonmanufacturing index rose to 63.1 in March from 59.8 in the prior month. The employment gauge in this survey also slipped, to 57.1 from 59.6.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The ISM survey provides a picture of the manufacturing sector that is growing at a moderately strong rate and yet struggling to overcome higher commodity prices," said Daniel Meckstroth, chief economist at the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a policy research group in Arlington, Virginia.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But pressures on profits are holding down hiring, he added. Indeed, the Labor Department's report said that manufacturing employment fell 8,000 in March and the factory head count is down 20,000 since December 2004. Job losses at factories and in the retail sector tempered gains in professional and business services, construction, education and health services.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The low jobless rate may overstate the underlying strength in the labor market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 7.7 million people unemployed in March, with an average duration of 19.5 weeks, the highest since November. The labor-force participation rate remained steady at only 65.8% for the month, the lowest level since 1988.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The participation rate, however, likely will improve if the economy continues to expand. "The slowdown in the labor force has been largely due to young people staying in school.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is a silver lining to the lukewarm jobs report, it is that it could benefit consumers by keeping a lid on mortgage rates.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jobs report has eased, for now, worries that the Federal Reserve might boost short-term interest rates half a percentage point at its May 3 policy meeting. The fact that employment growth remains sluggish while economic growth is strong suggests that growth in output per worker -- productivity -- has picked up again after slowing late last year. Higher productivity helps firms keep a lid on costs and thus prices. And despite the fall in the unemployment rate, there is still no sign of accelerating wages. Even so, the Fed remains worried about inflation, and price reports will likely play a bigger role in its interest-rate decisions than job reports.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, consumers weren't as upbeat in March, with sentiment toward both present and future economic conditions declining, according to another survey.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN GRAEME GLADE decided to sell his Hawaiian ocean-view home recently, he didn't list it locally, figuring few people would get to tiny Haleiwa on north Oahu to see his "For Sale" sign. He also passed over national advertisements, figuring there's a limited pool of U.S. buyers ready to pay his $3.75 million asking price. Instead, he put his home on a Web site that specializes in international listings, and so far he's fielded inquiries from Japan to the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My home seems expensive to the locals," says Mr. Glade, a building subcontractor who did get a few nibbles from Americans, but is considering a bid from a British citizen. "But to foreigners, it's a bargain."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With an eye on the weak dollar, American homeowners are increasingly seeking out buyers who come not from around the block or even a nearby town -- but from other countries altogether. And foreigners, hoping for a deal, are more eager than ever to buy here. The upshot: The residential real-estate market is getting a small shot of globalization. Unique Homes, a U.S.-listing publication with distribution in 80 countries, has seen foreign Web hits more than double in the past year, while DuPont Registry of Homes in St. Petersburg, Fla., says demand by foreign distributors for its luxury magazine is up 12% from last year. Meanwhile, in part to pitch more U.S. homes to people in other countries, New Jersey-based Century 21 has expanded to 43 countries, up from 36 two years ago, and property broker Christie's Great Estates, in Santa Fe, N.M., is planning moves into South America and Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the fact that buying homes -- and even quickly reselling them -- continues at a fervid pace, it would seem that U.S. homeowners wouldn't have to go abroad to find buyers. But in places like California's Orange County and New York, prices have climbed so high that the pool of potential purchasers has actually shrunk -- to folks who already own homes in the area and have built up equity, or who have quick access to a lot of cash. Expanding a sales pitch to foreigners, especially those whose native currency has risen against the dollar, can help pick up the slack. Another bonus: Since foreigners find it more difficult to get financing here, they tend to pay all cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet international buyers come with their own set of issues. In cases where a buyer does need a mortgage, U.S. and foreign banks tend to drag the process out as they check credit ratings and financial information abroad and at home. It's also standard protocol in some other countries to "lowball" a property, typically offering about half of what a home is listed for. That means that haggling can take on a larger role, with some foreign buyers bargaining up to the very end. "Don't be surprised if the buyer asks for the Ferrari at the closing table," says Olivia Hsu Decker, a broker in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there can always be odd demands in real-estate transactions, they sometimes get exaggerated by cultural differences, as Michael and Karen Carroll discovered while fielding proposals for a five-bedroom oceanfront home in Corolla, N.C., (asking price: $7.4 million). One buyer from Australia proposed via e-mail that the Carrolls swap their home for his 1,000-acre ranch. "I can't go flying around the world trying to figure out what someone else's property is worth," says Ms. Carroll, who is still looking for a buyer after turning down offers from the U.S. and abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ken Knowles has gotten even stranger requests. Since putting his home in Auburn, Ky., on the international market for $1.2 million a month ago, the electronics-firm owner has received an offer from a shopper in Mexico who asked that a caretaker be included in the deal and an Australian who wanted Mr. Knowles's grand piano and backyard lawn tractor. A writer with a return address in Nigeria promised to buy the house -- but first, he asked Mr. Knowles to help him "transfer some funds" by supplying his bank account and personal-identification numbers. "I never realized I'd have to sift through so much mumbo-jumbo," says Mr. Knowles, who is still looking for a buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While no one keeps records of how many foreign buyers are entering the U.S. market, brokers say foreigners prefer resorts or second-homes markets over most major cities. According to the National Association of Realtors, a record 2.82 million second homes were sold in 2004, up 16.3% from the year before. Those purchases were more affordable for foreigners whose buying power has increased: The Canadian dollar has risen 30% against the U.S. dollar over the past three years; the euro is up 50% over the same period, and the Australian dollar has jumped 39%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all sellers are casting abroad for buyers, of course, but the concept is catching on -- and could grow if interest rates continue to rise, as they did last week. In that scenario, the dollar would likely strengthen, economists say, but more U.S. residents who couldn't afford an interest-rate increase would get squeezed out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, many real-estate businesses are stepping up outreach efforts. Later this year, Century 21 plans to roll out an online service that will hook up a foreign buyer with a U.S.-based agent who speaks his language. (Once the buyer finds an American property on the company's site, he will be able to fill out an online form that will be forwarded via the site to a U.S.-based agent who speaks his language; the agent will follow up.) To encourage real-estate agents to cooperate more across borders, the National Association of Realtors launched a program in November that has begun registering agents world-wide, if they pass a new online exam in NAR's database. (The idea is that sellers will trust a foreign agent with the certification and be more likely to pursue a deal.) So far, 150 agents have registered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even builders are trying to cash in. Marshal Rothman, a builder in Mill Valley, Calif., just sold a six-bedroom home to a British couple for $4.5 million, after advertising on a free Internet site. In Cape Coral, Fla., Realmark Group has started targeting foreigners with ads in Lufthansa inflight magazines; it also posts signs and ads near the exit at the nearby Fort Myers International Airport. The company's managing broker is Scottish, and a senior sales executive is German; the architect is Cuban. Sales agents are required to speak German or French. "We don't want to miss anybody," says Will Stout, the company's American-born owner. The company says about 15% of its buyers are foreigners, up from 10% two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But reaching buyers who live abroad isn't always easy. Because most foreign countries don't have multiple-listing services, simply getting your house in front of the public can be challenging. What's more, some brokerage firms that work with foreigners have pretty high standards, dollarwise -- homes listed by Christie's average $5 million -- and tend to work in only a select number of states. For their part, foreign buyers complain that U.S. Web sites provide ample listings, but can skimp on practical information about financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it can be just as hard to snag a foreign buyer willing to pay your price as it is to find an American one. In spite of a flurry of inquiries from Europeans at the end of last year, real-estate broker Mercedes Huff in Jackson Hole, Wyo., says no deals ever materialized. The pickings have been even slimmer in Los Angeles, according to broker Jeff Hyland. "We haven't seen Europeans take advantage of the dollar here. I'm still waiting for it."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign Affairs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think your home might appeal to a buyer abroad? Here are some tips to help you reach foreign clients and make negotiations smoother.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CONSIDER ADVERTISING in American publications that foreigners may read, including professional or alumni magazines, trade or hobby newsletters or Chamber of Commerce magazines distributed abroad, suggests Beverly Hills, Calif., broker Carmela Ma. Rates in these publications can be low, and because they don't carry many real-estate ads, your house will stand out. Or try local ethnic publications that might be shared with relatives back home, like a Hispanic newspaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SINCE FOREIGN BUYERS often have a hard time establishing credit with banks in the U.S., consider advertising your home with seller financing. Offer a rate just below that what local lenders are offering, perhaps adjustable to a lower rate in case the dollar rises against the buyer's currency. (You will manage the loan and be paid periodically by the buyer.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOOK FOR AMERICAN real-estate agents who have lived overseas, have dual citizenships or travel often in other countries. "You need someone who speaks the lingo," says Daniel Webster Johnson, a broker in Breckenridge, Colo. The Re/Max site, www.remax.com[http://www.remax.com] , has a "Find an Agent" icon that lets you search for an agent by language skills and location. The National Association of Realtors' site, www.realtor.org[http://www.realtor.org] , lets you search for a "Certified International Property Specialist."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MANY CULTURES are more formal than ours, so when buyers visit, take your cues from them, says Sarasota, Fla., broker Wendy Ross. For instance, some cultures turn to relatives for financing, so don't be surprised if a large extended family flies in to tour your home. Give particular respect to elders in the family, since often they're the ones who will green-light the sale, even if they aren't going to live in the house.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp;Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JOEL RASSMAN IS chief financial officer of Toll Brothers Inc. An Economy page article in some editions Friday that included the monthly new-home sales report incorrectly said he was chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ Mar. 28, 2005)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END) </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for long-lasting factory goods grew modestly and sales of new homes surged last month, indicating that the economy's steady growth continued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department's durable-goods report showed orders for items intended to last three years or more grew 0.3% in February, boosted by gains in civilian and military aircraft that largely offset weakness in motor vehicles and other transport equipment. The department said orders fell a revised 1.1% in January, somewhat better than the previous estimate of a 1.3% drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The durable-goods report showed that orders for transportation equipment had the largest increase -- $900 million, or 1.6%, to $53.6 billion. Excluding transportation goods, orders decreased 0.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Durable-goods orders are highly volatile and most economists emphasize the need to look at the trend over several months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you take the last three months compared to the same period a year ago, new orders are up 10% for durable goods, so we're still seeing relatively strong activity," said Daniel Meckstroth, chief economist of the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a policy-research group in Arlington, Va. This included price increases that somewhat distorted the comparison, he added, but prices of machinery were up only about 2% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Greenlaw, an economist for Morgan Stanley, said the main disappointment in the numbers was the pullback in shipments. Shipments of manufactured durable goods dropped $3.4 billion, or 1.6%, to $53.6 billion in February, following four consecutive monthly increases. "In this environment of stronger orders," he said, "you wouldn't expect so much of a pullback in shipments."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, new-home sales jumped 9.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,226,000, the Commerce Department said. "There's tremendous desire on the part of the American consumer to own a home, and there's a very constricted supply," said Joel Rassman, chief executive of Toll Brothers Inc., one of the nation's largest builders of luxury homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, initial claims for unemployment benefits rose 3,000 to 324,000 during the week ended March 19, the Labor Department said. The four-week average rose 4,000 to 322,000, its third consecutive increase after hitting its lowest level since October 2000 late last month. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Timothy Aeppel  </div><div>624 words</div><div>24 March 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher energy costs pushed up U.S. consumer prices more than expected last month, fueling inflation worries and heightening concerns that the Federal Reserve could accelerate the pace of interest-rate increases.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department reported Wednesday that its consumer-price index rose 0.4% in February on a seasonally adjusted basis from the month before, the largest increase in four months. Energy accounted for "virtually all of the acceleration" in the index, the agency said, but other goods and services also played a role. Medical-care costs rose 0.6% and are now up 4.3% from a year ago. Housing and education also rose, more than offsetting a decline in computers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding food and energy, items prone to volatile price swings, consumer prices were up 0.3% from the month before, the biggest increase since a matching rise last September and breaking a string of four monthly gains of 0.2%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report from the National Association of Realtors held further evidence of inflationary pressure in the U.S.: The median price for existing housing hit $191,000 in February, up 11% from a year ago. The report said sales of existing homes fell 0.4% in February, compared with the month before, to a seasonally adjusted rate of 6.79 million. Higher interest rates are expected curb both new-home and existing-home sales, but the February figure was still considered healthy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Kunz, president and chief executive of Century 21 Real Estate Corp., a unit of New York-based Cendant Corp., said he is "optimistically cautious" about the outlook for his sector. His company was predicting a decline in sales this year, he said. "But year-over-year, we're still up 6.1%, and last year was a record year."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's reports, taken together with increases in producer prices reported earlier this week, suggested that inflation -- while still modest -- is continuing to accelerate. The Fed on Tuesday signaled for the first time in four years that it has inflation concerns, saying that while "longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident." The Fed raised its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 2.75% from 2.5%, its seventh quarter-point increase since last May.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say a big check to overall inflation is American consumers' stinginess. They are quick to switch to cheaper products and have more tools at their fingertips, such as the Internet, to hunt for bargains. Stephen Gallagher, U.S. chief economist at SG CIB, the corporate- and investment-banking arm of France's Societe Generale Group, says he expects consumer resistance and competitive pressures to stabilize the pace of inflation, making more-aggressive Fed action unnecessary.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he and other economists say chances are growing that the Fed may accelerate rate increases, particularly if inflation continues to rise more rapidly than expected. "The Fed's moving in that direction," Mr. Gallagher says, adding that "it would be a classic thing for the bank to do: They typically speed up rate hikes just at the time they should be slowing down."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Ryding, chief U.S. economist at Bear Stearns, says the Fed's latest statement opens the door to a possible 0.5-percentage-point rate increase at the Fed's next interest-rate policy meeting, May 3. But Mr. Ryding says he still expects the Fed to stick to a quarter-point move instead.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report from the National Association of Realtors contained further evidence of inflationary pressure in the U.S.: The median price for existing housing hit $191,000 in February, up 11% from a year ago. The report said sales of existing homes fell 0.4% in February, compared with the month before, to a seasonally adjusted rate of 6.79 million homes. Higher interest rates are expected curb both new-home and existing-home sales, but the February figure was still considered healthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Kunz, president and chief executive of Century 21 Real Estate Corp., a unit of New York-based Cendant Corp., says he is "optimistically cautious" about the outlook for his sector. His company was predicting a decline in sales this year, he said. "But year-over-year, we're still up 6.1%, and last year was a record year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's reports, taken together with increases in producer prices reported earlier this week, suggested that inflation -- while still modest -- is continuing to accelerate. The Fed on Tuesday signaled for the first time in four years that it has inflation concerns, saying that while "longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident." The Fed raised its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 2.75% from 2.5%, its seventh quarter-point increase since last May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 49 Tire in Richland, Miss., an independent tire dealership, inflation is starting to pinch -- but not in the way consumers might expect. Owner Chris Tolleson says tire makers, citing higher oil and other raw-material costs, have pushed up what he pays for tires 3% to 10% during the past year. But ferocious competition -- from both other independent dealers and big-box retailers -- still makes it tough to raise his retail prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've made up for some of that with labor charges," says Mr. Tolleson, who has increased his service fees about 7% during the past year and started charging for "road hazard plans" that he used to offer free with new tires. Others in the region are doing the same, so his labor rates are still competitive, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say a big check to overall inflation is American consumers' stinginess. They are quick to switch to cheaper products and have more tools at their fingertips, such as the Internet, to hunt for bargains. Stephen Gallagher, U.S. chief economist at SG CIB, the corporate- and investment-banking arm of France's Societe Generale Group, says he expects consumer resistance and competitive pressures to stabilize the pace of inflation, making more-aggressive Fed action unnecessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he and other economists say chances are growing that the Fed may accelerate rate increases, particularly if inflation continues to rise more rapidly than expected. "The Fed's moving in that direction," Mr. Gallagher says, adding that "it would be a classic thing for the bank to do: They typically speed up rate hikes just at the time they should be slowing down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Ryding, chief U.S. economist at Bear Stearns, says the Fed's latest statement opens the door to a possible half-point rate increase at the Fed's next interest-rate policy meeting, May 3. But Mr. Ryding says he still expects the Fed to stick to a quarter-point move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its report, the Labor Department said overall consumer prices were up 3% in the 12 months through February. Excluding food and energy, prices were up 2.4% in that period, the fastest rate since August 2002. In February, energy prices rose 2%, rebounding from a 1.1% decline in January, but well below the 4% spike seen in October.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York -- IT IS NO SECRET that U.S. home builders have been putting up houses at a furious pace. But even housing-industry executives -- typically an optimistic lot -- were taken aback when the government reported last week that home-building activity has accelerated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Commerce Department said that construction was started on new homes in February at an annualized rate of 2.2 million units. That was 15.8% higher than a year earlier and the fastest pace of residential construction starts in 21 years. Starts for single-family homes, the largest component of residential housing, reached an annual rate of 1.78 million units, a record. Even though many economists believe these numbers will ease in the months ahead as inventories of unsold homes start to pick up, it still is likely that 2005 could be the biggest year for home construction in decades.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Activity isn't isolated to the affluent suburbs or the trendy sections of cities. Even the Bronx, the poorest of New York City's five boroughs, is seeing record levels of housing construction. All this building raises a natural question: Why does the U.S. need so much new housing?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The simple answer, of course, is rising demand. But what is behind the demand is worth considering. First and foremost, the demand for housing reflects two key demographic trends -- new household formations and immigration. Economists at Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies believe that household formations in the current decade will outpace formations during the 1990s, when they estimate that 12.5 million households were formed. Growth has been due in part to many so-called Generation Xers -- or people born from 1965 to 1980 -- establishing households at younger ages than even their parents did. Over the next 10 years, the Joint Center estimates that between 13.4 million and 14.5 million new households will be formed, depending on the level of immigration.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE U.S. CENSUS Bureau estimates that immigration is running at about 850,000 a year, but the Joint Center says the actual number is between 1.2 million and 1.3 million. If immigration comes in on the high side, household formations will begin to approach levels last seen "when the baby boomers stormed into adulthood in the 1970s," says Eric Belsky, the center's executive director, referring to the baby-boom generation born from 1946 through 1964.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising wealth is a second factor behind strong housing demand. According to a recent report by the National Association of Realtors, 2.82 million second homes were sold in 2004, up sharply from the previous year. Exactly how many of those homes were newly constructed is hard to know, although estimates range from 5% to 15%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's another, less-discussed factor fueling demand for new construction: The rapid replacement of unusable and undesirable homes. According to housing-industry economists, the U.S. housing stock is in the process of being rebuilt, as aging stock is torn down to make room for newer stock. The average age of an American home is about 33 years -- older than any previous time in U.S. history. As the housing stock ages, new construction starts "will be permanently elevated because we need to replace housing stock which is wearing out," says Fannie Mae economist David Berson.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NOT THAT THE oldest homes in the U.S. are disappearing the fastest. In some parts of the country, 100-year-old houses remain highly desirable owing to their size, architecture and solid construction. Older homes of shoddy or inferior construction are the prime targets of demolition. Homes also are removed or lost because of disasters such as hurricanes or fires, the conversion of structures between residential and nonresidential use and because of "tear downs," where home buyers tear down a perfectly fine, but smaller, home in an older neighborhood and build a larger house on the same lot. "The key is location," says National Association of Home Builders economist David Seiders. "Older neighborhoods are being systematically upgraded."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting a fix on how many homes are being removed from the housing stock is tricky. One study cited in a report by the NAHB found that net removals of housing between 1985 and 1995 totaled 7.4 million, or about 740,000 a year. The Census Bureau estimates are substantially smaller and they are forecasting net removals will total about 450,000 annually between now and 2013.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the activity isn't isolated to the affluent suburbs or the trendy sections of cities. Even the Bronx, the poorest of New York City's five boroughs, is seeing record levels of housing construction. According to Wilhelm Ronda, director of planning and development in the Bronx Borough President's Office, the value of residential developments under construction rose to $575 million (432 million euros) last year from $174 million in 2001.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this building raises a natural question: Why does the U.S. need so much new housing?  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising wealth is a second factor behind strong housing demand. As baby boomers come into their peak wealth years, a good percentage are buying second homes. According to a recent report by the National Association of Realtors, 2.82 million second homes were sold in 2004, up sharply from the previous year. Exactly how many of those homes were newly constructed is hard to know, although estimates range from 5% to 15%.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average age of an American home is about 33 years -- older than any previous time in U.S. history. The number of homes older than 50 years rose to 25.8 million in 2000 from about 18.8 million in 1990. The average age of the U.S. housing stock swayed between 23 and 27 years from 1940 to 1990, then started a persistent rise. As the housing stock ages, new construction starts "will be permanently elevated because we need to replace housing stock which is wearing out," says Fannie Mae economist David Berson.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NOT THAT THE oldest homes in the U.S. are disappearing the fastest. In some parts of the country, 100-year-old houses remain highly desirable due to their size, architecture and solid construction. Older homes of shoddy or inferior construction are the prime targets of demolition. Homes also are removed or lost due to disasters such as hurricanes or fires, the conversion of structures between residential and nonresidential use and because of "tear downs," where home buyers tear down a perfectly fine, but smaller, home in an older neighborhood and build a larger house on the same lot. This is occurring as more people decide they want the convenience of living close to the city, which often means living in an older neighborhood, yet they also want the amenities and space of a new house. "The key is location," says National Association of Home Builders economist David Seiders. "Older neighborhoods are being systematically upgraded."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting a fix on how many homes are being removed from the housing stock is tricky. One study cited in a report by the NAHB found that net removals of housing between 1985 and 1995 totaled 7.4 million, or about 740,000 a year. The Census Bureau estimates are substantially smaller and they're forecasting net removals will total about 450,000 annually between now and 2013. Most economists believe Census estimates are far too conservative. In any case, all economists agree that the replacement of housing stock has been strong and will likely rise in the years ahead. And that, says Mr. Berson, means "new starts will be permanently elevated because we need to replace housing stock which is wearing out."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't necessarily mean that home prices will continue to shoot up at double-digit rates or that housing speculators will continue to cash in. But it does suggest there are some strong fundamentals behind the building boom.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Replacing old stock with new housing partly explains the high level of residential construction in older neighborhoods such as the Bronx, where, according to Mr. Ronda, demand for newly constructed homes is so strong that one waterfront development was sold out even though some homes won't be completed for two years. Not surprisingly, it's a trend that Bronx officials applaud because of the broader economic implications. "When you rebuild neighborhoods that were devastated in the '60s and '70s, it all has a domino effect," says Mr. Ronda. "We're now seeing complete shopping areas come back to life because neighborhoods are coming back."  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp;Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NUMBER OF large multifamily houses started in February rose 1.7% from the previous month to 420,000 units. An article on the U.S. trade deficit yesterday incorrectly stated that the number of starts in that category was unchanged at 365,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ March 8, 2005)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END) </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. current-account deficit ballooned to a record $665.9 billion last year, indicating that the weaker dollar is having little effect so far on the enormous imbalance between what Americans buy from overseas and what they sell abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current-account deficit -- the most-inclusive measure of the trade gap -- was 25% wider in 2004 than it was in 2003, equaling 6.3% of gross domestic product, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. In 2003, the deficit measured 4.8% of GDP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data suggest that not only has the trade imbalance resisted the effects of a weaker dollar but also that the dollar's decline may not be over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Over a long period of time the trade balance being so deeply in the red is a cause for concern about the direction of the dollar's equilibrium value," said Jason Bonanca, currency strategist for Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro has gained 47% against the dollar since May 2002, trading at about $1.34 yesterday afternoon. The dollar, which bought 104.24 yen yesterday afternoon, has lost 22% of its value against the Japanese currency since April 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In theory the interplay between the current-account deficit and the dollar should work like this: The expanding trade gap makes foreigners less inclined to invest money in the U.S., eventually pushing down the value of the dollar. A weaker dollar makes American goods and services more attractive abroad and imported products pricier in the U.S., gradually narrowing the deficit in an automatic correction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the worst-case scenario, foreigners get so skittish about dollar assets -- U.S. stocks, bonds, factories and the like -- that they pull their money out, the dollar plunges, U.S. interest rates shoot up and the American economy slows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the current-account deficit keeps expanding, driven by fast growth in the U.S. that generates demand for imports, relatively slower growth in Europe and Japan that stifles demand for American exports, rising oil prices and a continued foreign appetite for dollar financial assets. In addition, Americans -- including the U.S. government -- are spending rather than saving at a time when foreigners are saving money and looking for a place to invest. While the dollar has fallen, its weakness has so far apparently been overwhelmed by the forces that are contributing to the widening of the trade deficit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The weaker dollar is probably helping a bit, but basically U.S. demand is running very strong," said Robert Mellman, vice president and senior economist at J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co. "Consumer spending is strong and especially consumer spending on goods is strong. Capital spending is growing in double digits."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current-account deficit has been expanding since the mid-1990s, and for years economists and currency traders have been warning that it cannot continue to do so indefinitely. "So far we're living relatively well with a problem that we were all taught would be a difficult problem with which to live," said Maury Harris, chief economist at UBS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are even suggestions that the current-account deficit could continue to grow. Foreigners seem willing to continue to put their money in the U.S. and finance American imports, despite some recent hints that Asian central banks are eager to diversify their holdings away from dollars. The net inflow of foreign capital into U.S. stocks rose $170.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared to a $93 billion increase in the third quarter. It was the largest net inflow since 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday's report also showed a narrowing U.S. surplus in the income category, the difference between what Americans receive in interest and dividends on foreign investments and what foreigners make on their investments in the U.S. Generally, the U.S. is the net beneficiary of those payments. The Commerce Department report showed that the U.S. surplus narrowed to $24 billion in 2004 from $33 billion in 2003, making the current-account deficit wider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That trend could exert some further downward pressure on the dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, Harvard economist Jeffrey A. Frankel, an adviser in the Clinton White House, said that the weakened dollar may yet help narrow the current-account deficit. After the 1985 Plaza Accord, an agreement among the U.S. and other major economic powers, the dollar fell precipitously. But it took until 1987 before exports rose and imports fell, narrowing the trade gap. "In retrospect the main explanation is just that there are lags and to get the really big effects took more than a year," Mr. Frankel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, while the dollar has fallen against the euro and yen, it hasn't done so against other Asian currencies, especially the Chinese yuan, which is kept artificially in a narrow range by Beijing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said U.S. factories, mines and utilities picked up the pace of production in February in line with market expectations, while January activity was revised up slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production rose 0.3% last month as factory production climbed steadily and utilities output dropped for the second straight month. The Fed revised industrial production in January to show a 0.1% growth rate compared with its initial estimate of unchanged output in that month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">February industrial capacity use was reported at 79.4%, its highest level since December 2000, and January capacity use was revised up to 79.2% from the previously reported 79%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, manufacturing production rose 0.5%, matching the 0.5% growth rates in January and December, which were revised up in the latest monthly report from previous estimates of 0.4% growth. February manufacturing capacity use came in at 78.5%, up from January's 78.2% and the highest level since November 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, housing starts increased by 0.5% to an annual rate of 2.195 million in February from an upwardly revised 2.183 million in January.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NUMBER OF large multifamily houses started in February rose 1.7% from the previous month to 420,000 units. An article on the U.S. trade deficit Thursday incorrectly stated that the number of starts in that category was unchanged at 365,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(AWSJ March 21, 2005)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Modest gains in U.S. industrial production and housing starts were overshadowed by reports of a record widening of the current-account deficit, the broadest gauge of the nation's global trade.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade gap last year soared to a high of $665.9 billion in 2004, the Commerce Department said yesterday, up 25.5% from the previous record of $530.7 billion, set the year before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pressured by rising oil prices, the shortfall widened even more than expected at the end of 2004 despite the dollar's fall against major currencies. The fourth-quarter deficit hit a record $187.9 billion, expanding 13.3% from an upwardly revised $165.9 billion in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said .  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current-account balance combines trade of goods and services, transfer payments, and investment income. But about 90% of the deficit is accounted for by the balance in goods and services. Increasing oil prices late last year and Americans' continuing appetite for foreign goods caused a sharp deterioration of the deficit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current account gap has widened to about 5.5% of gross domestic product, up from 1.5% in 1996. Last week, Federal Reserve Gov. Ben Bernanke said a significant surge in the global supply of saving during the past decade helps explain the deterioration in the current account deficit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imports of goods climbed to $392.1 billion in the fourth quarter from $372 billion. "Much of the increase was in petroleum and petroleum products and in consumer goods," the Commerce report said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exports of goods advanced to $208.6 billion from $205 billion. Much of the increase was in industrial supplies and materials and in consumer goods.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also shows data on foreign-owned assets in the U.S. Foreigners purchased $124.7 billion of U.S. corporate and agency bonds in the fourth quarter, up from the $88.2 billion of purchases in the third quarter. Foreigners bought $12.1 billion of U.S. Treasury securities during the quarter, up from $900 million purchased in the prior three months, and a net $45.5 billion of U.S. stocks, compared with net purchases of $4.8 billion in the third quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said U.S. factories, mines and utilities picked up the pace of production in February in line with market expectations, while January activity was revised up slightly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production rose 0.3% last month as factory production climbed steadily and utilities output dropped for the second straight month. The Fed revised industrial production in January to show a 0.1% growth rate compared with its initial estimate of unchanged output in that month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">February industrial capacity utilization was reported at 79.4%, its highest level since December 2000, and January capacity utilization was revised up to 79.2% from the previously reported 79%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, manufacturing production rose 0.5%, matching the 0.5% growth rates in January and December, which were revised up in the latest monthly report from previous estimates of 0.4% growth. February manufacturing capacity use came in at 78.5%, up from January's 78.2% and the highest level since November 2000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. manufacturers have been projecting their growth rate will exceed the overall economy in 2005 and 2006 in a continuing recovery from their 2001-02 recession.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, housing starts increased by 0.5% to an annual rate of 2.195 million in February from an upwardly revised 2.183 million in January. Single-family homes increased by 0.3% to 1.775 million, while large multifamily starts were unchanged at 365,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits fell by 2.7% to an annual rate of 2.071 million. On balance, housing is continuing to hold up well in the face of firming interest rates.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Ray A. Smith and Ryan Chittum </div><div>1251 words</div><div>9 March 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PAM GILHOOLY and her sister Valerie King, both of Edinburgh, Scotland, spent many holidays in Florida and often dreamed of buying a place there. Their wish came true last year when the weakening dollar enabled them to pool their savings to buy a four-bedroom, 3 1/2-bath home in Orlando for $214,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We thought it was a fantastic time to buy," Ms. Gilhooly, a lab technician, says. A similar property back home would have cost about $950,000, she says. "The currency definitely helped."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weakness of the dollar has suddenly made the cachet of owning a second home in the U.S. possible for many Europeans -- and they are snapping up houses and condos across Florida, as well as New York and other locations like Chicago and Colorado's ski resorts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro has risen about 10% against the dollar in the last year and more than 50% in the last three years. Meanwhile, the British pound is up about 35% from three years ago and about 5% in the last year. Though housing prices in the U.S. have hit record highs -- the median price of a single-family home in West Palm Beach-Boca Raton, Fla., rose 36% last year to $361,800, for example -- foreign buyers are undeterred because of the strength of their own currencies and housing prices that are often even higher in their own countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one keeps statistics on foreign buying of U.S. residential real estate, but brokers and housing experts say foreigners have stepped up their purchases. Liz Agnello, director of broker services at the Ginn Co., of Orlando, says a broker in England recently referred 14 people to her, all of whom were interested in the company's new condos at the Reunion Resort &amp;Club of Orlando, which range from $500,000 to $800,000. "You don't normally get 14 foreigners at one time," she says. "It's not an uptick. It's a surge."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreigners have always bought U.S. real estate, particularly when the dollar is weak. But the current buying spree has more steam, thanks to the impact of a single European currency and cheaper airfares, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The creation of the euro in 1999 is driving European bargain hunters to the U.S. because they can no longer take advantage of weak currencies of countries within the continent to get deals on homes, says Jeremy Siegel, professor of finance at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another key difference is cheaper airfares. Deregulation of the airline industry fueled competition and led to cheaper flights, making the U.S. more accessible for overseas travelers, says Stuart Gabriel, a professor of finance and economics at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the bargain prices, some foreign buyers may not spend much time at these second homes. Ms. Gilhooly and Ms. King plan to vacation at their Florida home three times a year for about two weeks each visit. They'll rent it the rest of the time. Airfares may be cheaper than in previous years, but not throughout the year: fares can cost over $1,000 roundtrip at peak times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some foreign buyers aren't content with snagging just one home. Jan Martin, a broker and director at SunSense International Property Ltd. in Kettering, in the United Kingdom, says in the past few months, a number of her customers have purchased multiple properties in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of them, Mike Pethick, a 43-year-old former owner of a leisure-wear clothing line whose primary residence is in Swindon, England, bought four condos in Miami as investments early last year. As the U.S. dollar got weaker, Mr. Pethick couldn't resist buying another condo in September. "It made a hell of a difference. It was a lot cheaper to buy then. In fact, if I had some spare cash, I would definitely buy now," says Mr. Pethick, who plans to sell the condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alvina Labsvirs Smith and her husband, who live in Warwickshire, England, were planning to buy one home to take advantage of the weak dollar but ended up buying two in the Orlando area last year. "You get a lot more for your money than you do in England," says Mrs. Smith, a teacher. "Property prices are very high there." The currency exchange made the $219,000 and $367,000 homes a bargain compared to the U.K., she says. They plan to vacation several times a year in one house and rent it the rest of the time; they will rent the other home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The activity is by no means limited to Florida. Brokers say Manhattan real estate is increasingly being bought by foreigners. Jonathan J. Miller, president of Miller Samuel Inc., a New York-based real-estate appraisal firm, estimates foreigners made up about one-third of the buyers of apartments in Manhattan in 2004, up from one-fourth in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pat O'Brien is one of them. After years of buying vacation homes and condos in Europe and his home country of Ireland, Mr. O'Brien recently bought a two-bedroom apartment in a luxury 78-story condominium building not far from Manhattan's Central Park, his first property purchase in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The [money] I put in was worth up to 40% more than it would have been before," says the 50-year-old tax accountant, who lives in Dublin and plans to use the apartment instead of staying in a hotel when he and his family are in town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He's shrewd when it comes to arbitrage," says Mr. O'Brien's broker Max Dobens, who is with Prudential Douglas Elliman. "He timed it perfectly." Mr. O'Brien declined to say how much he paid, but Mr. Dobens says two-bedroom apartments in the building are now on the market for between $2 million and $2.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign demand is helping to keep home prices lofty, exacerbating concerns about a housing bubble in the U.S. while, at the same time, pushing homes in some areas out of reach of local residents. Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University, says increased demand for residential real estate in Manhattan from foreigners, for instance, has had the indirect effect of increasing demand -- and pushing up prices -- for housing in boroughs such as Brooklyn and Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, foreigners are dominating sales at entire developments. The majority of pre-sales for the first two phases of a six-phase luxury condominium hotel in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., have been to buyers from the U.K., Ireland and Europe. Sales began early last year and are 71% international and 29% domestic, says Larry Cohen, senior vice president of Lake Buena Vista Resort LLC, the Orlando-based developer of that complex as well as numerous other condominium projects in Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is unusual for us. In the past, it's been more like 80% domestic and 20% international," he says. Units in the new condo hotel, set to open in November, range from $349,000 for a two-bedroom to $699,000 for penthouses. Some foreigners bought after seeing pictures of model units on the Internet. </p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>318 words</div><div>8 March 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales are slowing from the feverish pace set last year but remain high by historical standards, the National Association of Realtors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The assessment is based on a new index of pending home sales, released by the NAR for the first time yesterday. The seasonally adjusted index, which equates the 2001 level of activity to 100, stood at 120.6 in January, down 2.1% from December but up 8.6% from January 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index is based on pending sales of previously occupied homes. Sales are considered pending when a contract has been signed but the transaction hasn't been completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index "tells us that home-sales activity in the near term is expected to be historically high but is trending off of peak levels recorded in 2004," David Lereah, the NAR's chief economist, said in a news release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR has long produced a monthly report on completed home sales and will continue to do so. But home sales typically aren't completed until a month or two after contracts are signed. The new index is designed to give a more timely signal of home-sales trends. The index shows the pace at which contracts are being signed and should foreshadow the pace of completions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR said it derives the index from a national sample representing about 20% of home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, David Berson, the chief economist of mortgage-finance company Fannie Mae, said in a weekly commentary that the rise of home purchases by investors has increased the risk of regional home-price declines. Mr. Berson cited a recent estimate by the NAR that 23% of all home purchases last year were for investment. Demand from investors is more volatile than that from owner-occupiers, Mr. Berson said. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Athletics and Software</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Auction Figures</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A STAR ATHLETE and a software tycoon are turning to auctions to unload multimillion-dollar properties. Former National Basketball Association star Karl Malone is putting his Salt Lake City home on the block May 19, according to J.P. King Auction Co., the firm handling the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the third time he's tried to sell the log and stone mansion; it first went on the market shortly after he was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers from the Utah Jazz in 2003. The original asking price, $6.1 million, was reduced last year to $5.75 million, according to James Marchant, the broker who had the listing, "There aren't many buyers in this price range in Salt Lake," Mr. Marchant says. "Higher-end buyers either build what they want" or buy property in upscale communities like Deer Valley or Park City, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Malone, 41, ranks second all-time in points scored and was selected as the NBA's Most Valuable Player after the 1997 and 1999 seasons. The custom mansion was built in 1997. It has eight bedrooms and 11 baths and measures 17,230 square feet. The home has three guest suites, basketball and tennis courts and two swimming pools. The sale will be an absolute auction, which means the property will be sold regardless of price. Mr. Malone couldn't be reached to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McAfee and Molokai</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On March 10, software developer John McAfee will put more than 1,000 acres of undeveloped land on the Hawaiian island of Molokai on the block, according to National Auction Group in Gadsden, Ala., the company handling the sale. He paid $1.3 million in 2003 for the coastline property, records show. It stretches from the ocean to the mountains and includes two fish ponds. Mr. McAfee, 60, founded the Santa Clara, Calif., software company McAfee Inc., formerly Network Associates and one of the largest antivirus-software companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1,046 acres will be sold either in its entirety or in five parcels; three oceanfront lots and two lots on the mountain side of the property. "Sometimes your eyes are bigger than your stomach," says Mr. McAfee, who owns two other properties on the island as well as homes in Colorado, Texas and Arizona. "I can only be in one place at a time," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, $48 billion in real estate was sold at auction, up from $42.3 billion in 2003 and $37.6 billion in 2002, according to the National Auctioneers Association. Owners who don't want to maintain the high costs often associated with expensive properties often turn to auctions, says National Association of Realtors spokesman Walter Molony. (Property taxes on Mr. Malone's home are nearly $34,000 a year, according to the Salt Lake County assessor's office.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does This Capri Fit?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE CAPRI VILLA owned by Italian actress and movie producer Edwige Fenech is on the market for 10 million euros (about $13.1 million). Last year, Ms. Fenech co-produced "The Merchant of Venice," starring Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons. She starred in a string of Italian comedies and thrillers in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as movies like "The Great Battle" in 1977 with Henry Fonda. Ms. Fenech, 54, bought the villa in 1990. Built in 1931, it has 7,000 square feet of living space and seven bedrooms, each with private bath. The home has a private beach, panoramic views of the Bay of Naples and Porto Grande and a 650-square-foot wine cellar. Raphael T. Harris Jr. of www.worldrealestate.it[http://www.worldrealestate.it] in Messina, Italy, has the listing. Ms. Fenech declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home View / Strong Seconds</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SALES OF SECOND HOMES surged 16% in 2004 to 2.82 million, with many of those buyers speculating on the real-estate market, according to new surveys by the National Association of Realtors, a trade group that represents real-estate brokers. The study, released earlier this week, shows that 23% of all homes purchased in 2004 were second homes bought for investment, according to the homeowners, while another 13% were vacation homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With real estate seen as a solid investment the past few years, more people are looking at property investment as a way to diversify their portfolios," says the NAR's vice president of research, Ellen Roche. For properties purchased between mid-2003 and mid-2004, the median price of a vacation home was $190,000 compared with $148,000 for investment homes. The surveys, conducted by mail and e-mail, looked at approximately 8,200 home-buyers and at about 3,300 home transactions. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Kemba J. Dunham  </div><div>508 words</div><div>2 March 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. manufacturing sector continued to grow in February, although the pace slowed slightly. Still, an increase in exports hints at strong economic activity in the months ahead.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, which polls purchasing agents at more than 400 industrial companies, said its index of manufacturing activity slipped to 55.3 in February from 56.4 a month earlier. This was the index's lowest reading since September 2003. Economists had expected a slightly higher February reading of 57.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the index was positive, representing the 21st consecutive month of U.S. manufacturing growth. Readings above 50 indicate the sector is expanding. The ISM index is closely watched by economists and investors because it provides an early look of economic activity in the preceding period and tends to track changes in the health of the U.S. industrial core.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders, production and employment all increased less rapidly in February, though economists weren't concerned by the results. "We're moving back to solid output, rather than robust growth, and that's just normal," said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Pennsylvania. "In 2005, the manufacturing sector will be supporting economic growth, rather than powering it."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report said 13 industries grew, while one had no change and six contracted.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM's export-orders index rose to 57.4 in February, from 56.9 a month earlier, marking its 38th consecutive month of growth. The weaker dollar, economists said, is driving the growth of exports and the rate should remain strong this year. "We need the export business to help drive the manufacturing sector," said Norbert Ore, chairman of the institute's survey committee.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers still face rising prices, though the pace cooled off a bit in February. The ISM's prices-paid index fell to 65.5 last month, from 69 in January.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report showed that U.S. chief executive officers are confident about strong economic growth in the next six months. The Business Roundtable said its March 2005 CEO Economic Outlook index rose to a record 104.4 from 98.9 in December, the last time the survey was released. The quarterly index combines the responses on projected sales, capital spending and employment into an overall index that shows how chief executives believe the U.S. economy will perform in the six months ahead. The Business Roundtable is a Washington lobbying group comprising 160 chief executives from some of the largest U.S. companies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department said total construction spending increased 0.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.047 trillion (790.8 billion euros) in January. Spending rose 1.2% in December, revised from the 1.1% gain first reported. Economists had expected a 0.6% increase in January because of bad weather in various parts of the country.  </p>

The weaker dollar, economists said, is driving the growth of exports and the rate should remain strong this year. "We need the export business to help drive the manufacturing sector," said Norbert Ore, chairman of the institute's survey committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers still face rising prices, though the pace cooled off a bit in February. The ISM's prices-paid index fell to 65.5 last month, from 69 in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report showed that U.S. chief executive officers are confident about strong economic growth in the next six months. The Business Roundtable, a Washington lobbying group, said its March 2005 CEO Economic Outlook index rose to a record 104.4 from 98.9 in December, the last time the survey was released. The quarterly survey combines the responses on projected sales, capital spending and employment into an overall index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department said total construction spending increased 0.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.047 trillion in January. Spending rose 1.2% in December, revised from the 1.1% gain first reported. Economists had expected a 0.6% increase in January because of bad weather in various parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, or Ofheo, pointed to a slight cooling in the housing market at the end of last year. According to Ofheo's quarterly index, home prices rose 1.7% in the fourth quarter from the third quarter, much slower than the 4.8% rise in the third quarter. When compared with a year earlier, home prices remained strong, rising 11% in the fourth quarter.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jeff D. Opdyke </div><div>704 words</div><div>2 March 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners in the hottest markets are facing a greater chance that the value of their houses will decline, according to a new study, though risks have lessened slightly for the nation as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its recently released winter 2005 Risk Index, mortgage insurer PMI Mortgage Insurance Co., a unit of PMI Group Inc., calculates a 16.1% chance of an overall housing-price decline in the top 50 metropolitan markets during the next two years. That is down from the firm's autumn reading of an 18.6% chance of a price decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Risks have heightened substantially for homeowners in many of the major metropolitan areas along the East and West coasts. The culprit: continued housing-price increases that are making the average home increasingly less affordable to the average buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, PMI notes in its report, "signals a further misalignment of home prices with long-term economic fundamentals," increasing the likelihood that home prices will slide at some point to come back into line with what residents can afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Boston-Cambridge-Quincy, Mass./N.H., metropolitan area tops the list as the region with the highest probability of experiencing a housing-price decline. The area scored a 533 on PMI's Risk Index, indicating a 53.3% probability of weaker home prices in the next two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That marks a big increase in risk for the New England hub. A year ago, Boston's probability for home-price declines stood at 23.3%. The area's problem "is that it has had strong home-price increases relative to poor income growth," says Marco Van Akkeren, an economist at PMI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PMI Risk Index ranges from one to 1,000, with a higher score indicating a greater likelihood of home-price declines. (A score of 100 represents a 10% chance of falling prices in the next two years.) PMI's proprietary calculus takes into account factors such as home-price appreciation, labor-market statistics and an index that shows how affordable a particular housing market is in relation to local incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California's six major metro areas all rank among the top 10 markets most likely to see prices fall. San Diego, in particular, holds the distinction of also having the nation's most unaffordable housing market in terms of annual income. Based on per-capita income of $36,815 in the area, a 30-year mortgage on the median-priced home -- valued at more than $578,000 -- would consume about 90% of the average resident's income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Away from the coasts, locales in and around Detroit; Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minn.; and Denver all ranked above the national average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the opposite end: Oklahoma City; Buffalo-Niagara Falls, N.Y.; and Pittsburgh all tied as cities least likely to experience a decline in home prices. They each scored 57, meaning they have a 5.7% chance of prices falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Results for the top 50 metropolitan statistical areas are available online at www.pmigroup.com/lenders/eret.html[http://www.pmigroup.com/lenders/eret.html] .</p>

</div><div class="author">By Paula L. Stepankowsky Dow Jones Newswires </div><div>1041 words</div><div>2 March 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B2F</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FEDERAL WAY, Wash. -- Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Co. could be the largest home builder you've never heard of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The division of forest-products giant Weyerhaeuser Co. likes it that way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The size of Weyerhaeuser's real-estate business is masked by the fact that the division operates under different names in each market it serves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So while many people aren't familiar with Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Co., or Wreco, they are familiar with Pardee Homes in the Southern California and Las Vegas markets, Quadrant Homes in Western Washington, Winchester Homes in the Washington, D.C., area and Trendmaker Homes in Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"By having a separate branding strategy and brand name, you can position yourself in a niche market better than if you are Weyerhaeuser," said Steve Atkinson, a forest-products analyst with BMO Nesbitt Burns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though it operates under four different names, the division booked nearly $2.5 billion in revenue in 2004, nearly double its total in 2000 and ranking it the 14th-largest home builder in the U.S. by revenue last year, up from 20th in 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wreco contributed $595 million in pretax operating earnings to its Federal Way, Wash., parent in 2004, the seventh consecutive year for record earnings growth. In the fourth quarter alone, Wreco contributed $217 million in pretax operating earnings to the parent, 40% of the overall company's total.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a consolidated net basis, Weyerhaeuser earned $1.3 billion, or $5.43 a share, on net sales of $22.7 billion in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The division is "just one of the better, if lesser-known, parts of the Weyerhaeuser story," said Steve Chercover, forest-products analyst with D.A. Davidson &amp;Co. "It's not a rounding error; it's making up a meaningful and relatively stable chunk of the earnings."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of its performance, Weyerhaeuser Chief Executive Steve Rogel has said the division may expand at a time when the parent is still focused on reducing debt from its acquisition of Willamette Industries three years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The business unit has earned the right to contribute a greater share of the company's income," said Steve Hansen, a forest-products analyst with Morningstar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wreco has benefited from a booming housing market and low interest rates in the past four years. While the Fed has increased rates steadily in the past 12 months, rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are lower now than they were last year this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the U.S. Commerce Department reported that U.S. housing starts rose 4.7% in January to a seasonally adjusted 2.15 million annual rate, the highest level since February 1984. Housing analysts had anticipated a 3.5% decline in January. In 2004, housing starts totaled 1.95 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think there is some risk of a slowdown in 2005 with rates increasing, which could translate into somewhat lower margins, but not lower volume," said Daniel Fulton, Wreco president and chief executive, in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wreco has been affected by delays caused by the storms that have hammered Southern California, a state that has seen hefty housing price increases that likely will level off in 2005, said Mr. Fulton, who has been at Wreco for 29 years of its 35-year history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fulton said the Las Vegas market may be cooling off, but the Los Angeles market is still very strong, as is the Washington, D.C., market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there might be some short-term slowing this year, the housing picture is bright over the long term, Mr. Fulton said. Growth factors include population growth, decreasing household size and an increasing level of homeownership. The mortgage industry also is offering new products that make it easier to get into a first house, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These all drive the view that the housing business looks very attractive," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weyerhaeuser is unique among its forest-products peers in its ownership of a real-estate division. The Wreco connection to parent Weyerhaeuser gives it several advantages, he said. "We try to take advantage of the size, stability and financial resources of Weyerhaeuser while encouraging and empowering local managers," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The local managers find the land and get financing through Wreco and Weyerhaeuser, and then they determine what product to build and how to market it, he said. Wreco also benefits from access to its parent's corporate services, benefits administration and human resources, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot of Weyerhaeuser wood also ends up in Wreco homes, though Wreco's wood pricing is similar to that of other large builders. When it is working with a contractor, however, it can specify some particular Weyerhaeuser products, such as Trus Joist or Silent Floor System, Mr. Fulton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to developing large master-planned communities for single-family homes, Wreco also sells land to other developers and offers capital to builders through its Weyerhaeuser Realty Investors division, a part of Wreco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a good balance they have," said Mr. Atkinson at BMO Nesbitt Burns. Mr. Atkinson doesn't own Weyerhaeuser stock, but BMO Nesbitt Burns has done banking business for Weyerhaeuser in the past year. "If you only have one product, the earnings become much more volatile, and investors like to have something a bit more stable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wreco's growth strategy is to build in existing markets, followed by growth in adjacent markets using the same management team, Mr. Fulton said. It also will continue to tailor its houses to the individual markets. Quadrant Homes, for example, are moderately priced and appeal to value buyers, while Winchester Homes in the Washington, D.C., appeal to high-end custom home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company also is evaluating possibilities for entirely new markets, and will move when capital is available, Mr. Fulton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house-building market is still highly fragmented, so acquisitions are likely for Wreco, said Arthur Oduma, a housing-industry analyst with Morningstar. "Size is might in the home-building industry, and the way to do that is to acquire smaller home builders," said Mr. Oduma, who doesn't own Weyerhaeuser stock and whose company doesn't provide banking services. </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. manufacturing activity grew at a slower pace in February, an unexpected development that was leavened by signs that price pressures retreated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, a private research group, said its manufacturing-activity index for February stood at 55.3, which represented a slowdown from January's 56.4 reading. The index was 57.3 in December.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Readings above 50 indicate growth and describe the breadth of the gain. The index doesn't capture the size of the change seen by individual companies surveyed by the ISM.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"February was another good month in the manufacturing sector," said Norbert Ore, who directs the survey. "While the overall rate of growth is slowing, the overall picture is improving as price increases and shortages are becoming less of a problem."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">February's readings came in below expectations. Forecasters in a survey conducted by Dow Jones Newswires had expected to see a reading of 57.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM said that most aspects of the manufacturing sector grew last month, albeit at a slower pace than in January. The group's new-orders index slipped to 55.8 after 56.5 in January, while the production index fell to 56.7 from 57.8.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the inflation front, manufacturers faced the 36th straight month of rising prices, although the pace cooled somewhat in February. The group's prices index was 65.5 in February, compared with 69 in January and 72 in December.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing payrolls also grew at a softer rate, with that gauge ebbing to 57.4, compared with 58.1 in January. It was the 16th month of growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the slower rate of hiring growth, Mr. Ore said, "employment is not really weak. . . . After some very strong months, the index now reflects a more normal level." He added, "I look forward to a good year for manufacturing."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories contracted in February, with a reading of 48.6 versus 52.8 the month before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Inventories are doing what they're supposed to do," said Mr. Ore. "Inventory growth is uncommon now that they've caught up with demand, I expect inventories will continue to stay negative."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Business Roundtable said its March 2005 CEO Economic Outlook index rose to 104.4, a record high, from 98.9 in December 2004, the last time the survey was released.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roundtable is an association of chief executives of U.S. corporations. The index combines the responses on projected sales, capital spending and employment into an index that shows how CEOs believe the U.S. economy will perform in the six months ahead. It has been conducted quarterly since the fourth quarter of 2002.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Commerce Department said total construction spending increased 0.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.047 trillion in January. Spending for December was revised to a 1.2% increase, instead of the 1.1% gain earlier reported.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The government's revised estimate of economic growth during the final quarter of last year showed an encouraging pickup for business investment but slower consumer-spending growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. gross domestic product increased at a 3.8% annual clip in the fourth quarter, significantly faster than the 3.1% rate that initially was estimated, the U.S. Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That compares with a growth rate of 4% in the third quarter. For all of 2004, the economy expanded 4.4%, the fastest pace since 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inflation component gave little reason for alarm, with the price index for personal consumption rising 2.5% during the fourth quarter from a year earlier, compared with a 1.3% increase during the third quarter. Excluding food and energy, prices advanced 1.6% and 0.9%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a prepared statement, U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow said the robust growth in business spending on capital goods along with other recent positive economic reports shows that the economy's "momentum is continuing into 2005."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, sales of existing homes eased 0.1% in January but maintained a healthy pace as mortgage rates remained relatively low, said the National Association of Realtors, a trade group. Sales were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.8 million last month, the seventh-best rate on record. That compared with a revised December rate of 6.81 million, which originally had been put at 6.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upward revision in fourth-quarter GDP was driven by adjustments to business spending, exports and inventory investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists were cheered by the healthy rate of business fixed investment -- which rose 14%, compared with an initial estimate of 10.3%. The rate was 13% for the third quarter. Investment in structures climbed 1.2% in the fourth quarter, and spending on equipment and software rose 18%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer-spending growth was 4.2%, slightly slower than the previous estimate of 4.6%. Spending rose 5.1% in the third quarter. Purchases of durable goods increased 3.1% and nondurables rose 6.1% for the latest quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The economy, as portrayed in aggregate statistics, is a fairly slow-moving creature," said Mat Johnson, an economist at ThinkEquity Partners, an institutional investment firm in San Francisco. "It will take some sizable factors to send these discernible trends in the other direction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another bright spot, exports rose 2.4%, while imports increased 11.4%, in the fourth quarter. The Commerce Department originally estimated that exports fell 3.9% and that imports rose 9.1%. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. government's revised estimate of economic growth during the final quarter of last year showed an encouraging pickup for business investment but slower consumer-spending growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross domestic product increased at an 3.8% annual clip in the fourth quarter, significantly faster than the 3.1% rate that initially was estimated, the Commerce Department said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That compares with a growth rate of 4% in the third quarter. For all of 2004, the economy expanded 4.4%, the fastest pace since 1999.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inflation component gave little reason for alarm, with the price index for personal consumption rising 2.5% during the fourth quarter from a year earlier, compared with a 1.3% increase year-to-year during the third quarter. Excluding food and energy, prices advanced 1.6% and 0.9%, respectively.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury Secretary John Snow said the robust growth in business spending on capital goods along with other recent positive economic reports show that the economy's "momentum is continuing into 2005."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, sales of existing homes eased 0.1% during January but maintained a healthy pace as mortgage rates remained relatively low, said the National Association of Realtors, a trade group. Sales were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.8 million last month, the seventh-best rate on record. That compared with a revised December rate of 6.81 million, which originally had been put at 6.7 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upward revision in the fourth-quarter growth rate for the economy was driven by adjustments to business spending, exports and inventory investment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists were cheered by the healthy rate of business fixed investment -- which rose 14% in the past quarter, compared with an initial estimate of 10.3%. The rate was 13% for the third quarter. Investment in structures climbed 1.2%, and equipment and software rose 18%, the government report said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer-spending growth slowed to 4.2% in the fourth quarter, slightly lower than the previous estimate of 4.6%. Spending rose 5.1% in the third quarter. Purchases of durable goods increased 3.1% and nondurables rose 6.1% for the quarter, the report said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The economy, as portrayed in aggregate statistics, is a fairly slow-moving creature," said Mat Johnson, an economist at ThinkEquity Partners, an institutional investment firm in San Francisco. "It will take some sizable factors to send these discernable `trends' in the other direction."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an additional bright spot, exports rose 2.4%, while imports increased 11.4% during the fourth quarter. The Commerce Department originally estimated that exports fell 3.9% and that imports rose 9.1%. During the third quarter, exports rose 6% and imports climbed 4.6%, the report said.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Jeff Bater Dow Jones Newswires  </div><div>731 words</div><div>17 February 2005</div><div>The Asian Wall Street Journal</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2005 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. industrial output was unchanged in January after three consecutive months of growth, the Federal Reserve said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. central bank also said production grew more slowly in December than previously thought, cutting the initial estimate a tenth of a percentage point to 0.7%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, industrial-capacity utilization, a measure of economic slack, declined for the first time since September. That measure fell by a tenth of a percentage point to 79%, a level that was two points below average for the past three decades, the Fed said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and CNBC had called for a 0.4% increase in production and a 79.3% capacity-utilization rate. But they were consistent with the Fed's view that inflation isn't likely to surge anytime soon given the gradual pace of U.S. economic growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factory production increased 0.4% in January, the same rate as in December. That drove the capacity-utilization rate for factories to 78%, the highest level since December 2000. Even so, the Fed said, the utilization rate was 1.8 percentage points below the average for the past three decades.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Production of automobiles and light trucks slowed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 11.42 million units from 11.69 million units in December, the Fed said. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, industrial production rose 0.2% in January after a 0.7% increase in December.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, new residential construction notched a surprising increase last month as low mortgage rates fueled increased activity in the Southern U.S., helping housing starts climb to the highest mark in nearly 21 years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said yesterday that housing starts rose 4.7% last month to a seasonally adjusted 2.159 million annual rate. It was the highest level of starts since February 1984's 2.26 million units. December starts were revised up to show a 14.3% increase to 2.063 million units. Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires and CNBC predicted starts would decrease, falling by 3.5% to a 1.93 million annual rate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stormy, snowy weather in the Northeast and Midwest and heavy rain in the West had been expected to put a damper on building activity -- and indeed, starts did decline in the Northeast and Midwest. Analysts expecting a slowdown pointed to the government's recent report on payroll employment that showed the U.S. construction industry shed 9,000 jobs last month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But robust activity in the South offset the declines in other regions. Starts climbed 19% in the South to 1.139 million units -- the region's highest level since February 1984's 1.187 million. Housing starts in the South accounted for more than half of the nation's building activity last month. Meanwhile, new construction fell 24% to 150,000 in the Northeast and 13% to 330,000 in the Midwest. Builders in the West broke ground on about 540,000 new homes, a 1.9% increase.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With mortgage rates staying low, economists expect the housing market to continue to be a bright spot for the broader economy. Freddie Mac reported last week that rates on 30-year mortgages had fallen for a sixth consecutive week to 5.57%. Rates have hovered below 6% since July, propelling sales of both new and existing homes to all-time highs in 2004. It was the fourth straight year that sales in both categories have set records.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another possibly bullish sign: Commerce reported building permits rose by 1.7% to a 2.105 million annual rate. That number also surprised analysts, who projected a 1.5% decline. Permit levels don't always correlate perfectly with actual activity, economists say. Permits fell in December by a revised 0.1%, for example, but building activity has continued at a brisk pace.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also showed single-family housing starts rose 2.7% in January to 1.760 million. Apartment-building construction was up by 17.9%. Nationwide, an estimated 140,700 houses were started in January, based on unseasonally adjusted figures.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Low mortgage rates in the U.S. and the strong economy helped push housing construction up in January to the highest level since early 1984.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, industrial output was unchanged in January from the previous month as utilities output fell 3%, largely due to relatively warm weather, the Federal Reserve said yesterday. Industrial capacity utilization was down for the first time since September, dropping 0.1% to 79.0%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 4.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.16 million units, from the upwardly revised 2.06 million units in December.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building remained strong despite damaging rain in the West and snowstorms in the East. Construction of single-family homes rose 2.7% to 1.76 million units. Construction of apartments rose 14% to 399,000 units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robust housing activity is expected to continue. Applications for building permits rose by 1.7% to an annual rate of 2.1 million units in January. The number of single-family home permits was up 0.7%, while apartment permits rose 5.3%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically low mortgage rates have served as an engine for housing activity. Despite the Fed's policy of raising rates in small increments since June to ease concerns over rising inflation, mortgage rates haven't climbed much.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freddie Mac reported last week that rates on 30-year mortgages had fallen for a sixth consecutive week to 5.57%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the industrial output report masked underlying strength. The broad index was held back by a utilities production decline of more than 3% in January, following a 2.8% increase in December. "The lack of growth in January industrial production was due to a weather-related decline in electric and gas utility production," said Daniel Meckstroth, chief economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, an Arlington, Virginia, association of manufacturers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With economywide inventories at very low levels, and across virtually every industry, continued production activity and business investment look to be the norm in the months and quarters ahead," said Mat Johnson, chief economist at ThinkEquity Partners, a San Francisco investment bank.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Production of autos and light trucks slowed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 11.42 million units from 11.69 million in December, the Fed said. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, industrial production rose 0.2% in January after a 0.7% increase in December.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Greg Ip </div><div>1096 words</div><div>17 February 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan cited uncertainty over productivity growth and the dollar, indicating U.S. interest rates would keep rising in the near future to keep inflation under wraps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Testifying before Congress, Mr. Greenspan gave fewer signals on the path of interest rates than he has in previous appearances. He didn't tell lawmakers whether interest rates would keep rising at a "measured" pace, as the Fed has said since last spring. "Measured" has come to indicate an increase of no more than a quarter of a percentage point per meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greenspan said the Fed's short-term interest rate target has risen "significantly" to 2.5% this month from 1% in June, "but by most measures, it remains fairly low" relative to inflation. That suggests that he thinks it still must rise somewhat before it is no longer stimulating overall spending and thus posing an inflation risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's semi-annual monetary policy report, the subject of Mr. Greenspan's appearance before the Senate Banking Committee yesterday, shows that the central bank remains optimistic on both economic growth and inflation. Most of the 19 voting and nonvoting Federal Open Market Committee members believe the economy will grow 3.75% to 4% this year, with inflation remaining in the 1.5% to 1.75% range -- using their preferred measure. They see growth slowing only slightly to 3.5% next year and inflation in the same 1.5% to 1.75% range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Greenspan's testimony suggested he is on the lookout for evidence of inflation pressure. In particular, he noted that growth in productivity, or worker output per hour, has slowed sharply in the past year. Slowing productivity growth means companies must use more labor to increase production, which could drive up costs. Firms would then have to accept narrower profit margins or raise prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Productivity is notoriously difficult to predict," he said. Its rapid growth from early 2003 through mid-2004, he said, reflected companies realizing "delayed efficiencies gains" from the 1990s high-tech investment boom. Its recent slowdown may mean "conceivably the backlog of untapped total efficiencies has run low," Mr. Greenspan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed chairman's uncertainty over future productivity growth is noteworthy since, as Goldman Sachs economists told clients, Mr. Greenspan "has been consistently optimistic about productivity growth" and was among the first to spot its acceleration a decade ago. Still, the text of the 25-page monetary-policy report was more upbeat: "Gains in structural productivity should continue, although not necessarily at the pace of recent years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greenspan also suggested, as he first did two weeks ago in London, that further declines in the dollar will be more inflationary than declines to date. The "somewhat quickened" growth in import prices, he said, indicates foreign firms that export to the U.S. have "only limited tolerance" to absorb further dollar depreciation in their profit margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed chief dwelt at length on the unusual decline in long-term bond yields since the Fed began raising short-term rates, which "contrasts with most experience." He played down technical explanations such as purchases of Treasury bonds by Asian central banks, mortgage hedging, and even confidence in low inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greenspan concluded the drop is "a conundrum," which may prove to be a "short-term aberration." He noted that measures of risk are unusually low across many markets, and, in a remark reminiscent of his warning about "irrational exuberance" in 1996, warned: "People experiencing long periods of relative stability are prone to excess. We must thus remain vigilant against complacency."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As significant as what Mr. Greenspan said is what he didn't say. Since July 2003, he has used his appearances before Congress to give guidance on the course of interest rates. In previous appearances, he has said the Fed would keep rates low for a "considerable period," then be "patient" in raising them, and now it will raise them at a "measured" pace. The paucity of such guidance yesterday may mean the central bank is less sure of what it, if anything, to say about its future actions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the one hand, the rise in rates to date means further increases are less urgent. But with the economy stronger and productivity growth slower, the Fed no longer has the sizable buffer against inflation that made it confident it could raise rates slowly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Fed officials have frowned on the use of forward-looking language, worrying that it limits their flexibility. The majority has concluded such guidance has kept markets calm and leveraged their rate actions. Asked by Banking Chairman Richard Shelby (R., Ala.) whether the Fed's post-meeting statements would cease to refer to "measured" rate increases or an "accommodative" stance of policy, Mr. Greenspan said, "We're not going to have the same statement in perpetuity. At some point, it's going to change." But he declined to say when.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Ashworth, an economist at London-based Capital Economics, predicted that the "measured" wording would stay "for a while yet. . . . If the Fed was thinking of dropping it soon, Greenspan would surely have begun to prepare the ground."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department reported that January housing starts rose to their highest level since early 1984. They rose 4.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.16 million units from 2.06 million in December. Building remained strong despite damaging rain in the West and snowstorms in the East. Construction of single-family homes rose 2.7% to 1.76 million units. Construction of apartments rose 14% to 399,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, industrial production was unchanged in January from the previous month as utilities output fell 3%, largely because of relatively warm weather, the Federal Reserve said. Industry used 79% of capacity, down from 79.1% in December. Manufacturing production rose 0.4%, and manufacturers operated at 78% of capacity, the highest utilization rate since December 2000.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kemba J. Dunham </div><div>560 words</div><div>16 February 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price appreciation skyrocketed at the end of 2004, as buyers competed for a tighter supply of homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the National Association of Realtors, the median price of a single-family home rose 8.8% to $187,500 in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with the year-earlier quarter. Prices appreciated much faster in the hottest housing markets, and a record number of metropolitan areas experienced double-digit price growth. Of the 129 metro areas that the NAR tracks, 62 saw home prices rise 10% or more. That was the largest number of cities with double-digit price increases since the NAR began publishing such data in 1982.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have been rising across the nation for several years, but economists at the NAR say the latest price surge reflects tight supply. For all of 2004, there was a 4.3-month supply of homes available for sale, the lowest annual supply on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest price increase was in the Las Vegas region, where the median price of a single-family home was $281,400 in the fourth quarter, up 47.3% from a year earlier. The second-strongest increase occurred in the Riverside-San Bernardino, Calif., area, where the median price was $322,400, up 34.7%. In third place was the West Palm Beach-Boca Raton-Delray Beach area of Florida, with a fourth-quarter median price of $338,800, a 34% increase over the previous year. The median is the midway price, with half of all homes selling for more than the median and half selling for less. In the third quarter of 2004, the national annual rate of home-price appreciation was 7.5%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices declined in four metropolitan areas: Indianapolis; Austin, Texas; Beaumont-Port Arthur, Texas; and Charleston, W.Va. NAR economist David Lereah said these areas currently are facing either local economic weakness or have a large supply of homes on the market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[As home prices soar, we survey more than 1,000 neighborhoods, finding big gains from Miami to Wayzata, Minn. June Fletcher on unexpected hot spots -- and whether the boom can last.]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROBERT ALBERTSON put his five-bedroom lakeside house in tiny Wayzata, Minn., up for sale last year at $1.4 million -- and, almost immediately, pulled it off the market. Calls from eager buyers convinced Mr. Albertson, who helped invent Mr. Coffee, that it was worth waiting to see if prices would rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They did: A few months' delay added another $100,000 to the value of the Tudor-style home, according to two recent appraisals, and he plans to put it back on the market at $1.5 million. Says Mr. Albertson, who bought the house in 1963 for $38,000: "Prices here have just gone crazy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What home-price bubble? So far, predictions of the U.S. housing market's demise have been greatly exaggerated. Despite some dark clouds -- war, a looming deficit, the weak dollar -- this market has continued to rise, with existing-home prices up 8.3% through the end of 2004, according to the National Association of Realtors, compared with 7.5% the year before. As low interest rates fueled sales, dozens of cities saw double-digit gains: In Glendale, Calif., where prices had already doubled in the past four years, the median home price rose 29.8% last year, to $440,000. In the old whaling town Marion, Mass., prices rose 13.5%, to an average of $550,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one can say for sure if this can continue. But at least some homeowners can brag that their neighborhood did even better than most. In a town-by-town survey conducted for Weekend Journal by housing specialists Fiserv CSW, we analyzed home-price changes in more than 1,200 ZIP codes for the year ending September 2004. To get a sense of the longer-term phenomenon, we also looked back at the change in these areas compared with five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the results were striking. From Florida's Gulf Coast to the Jersey Shore, some of the fastest-growing neighborhoods are ones that used to be second choices. Some people are relocating less for jobs than for views: Waterfront access was the feature many of our fastest-appreciating towns shared, along with new commuter lines or magnet schools. Spillover was a factor in some booming areas, as many of our "hot" neighborhoods turned out to be right next door to longtime enclaves of wealth (see: Montclair, N.J.; south Orange County). Meanwhile, only 10 neighborhoods we surveyed showed price declines; four of those were in Salt Lake City suburbs, which saw heavy building ahead of the 2002 Winter Olympics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market's continued growth has surprised some economists who thought, last year at this time, that home prices were headed for a fall. Many of these people still believe prices will drop this year, as expected mortgage-rate increases kick in. "It's like the stock market in the late '90s," says economist Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, D.C. He points out that overall, housing prices have grown by 40% since 1995, adjusted for inflation, the steepest rise in five decades. "It's too overheated," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, other economists say they don't see home prices falling anytime soon -- though they do expect gains to be more modest. Lawrence Yun, senior forecast economist for the National Association of Realtors, expects growth to slow to 5% over the next year based in part on anticipated interest-rate rises. However, he doesn't see prices falling, he says, because job creation is expected to rise, boomers are still in their peak buying years and the inventory of homes available for purchase is currently at a historic low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even economists who believe the market is still primed for growth say some areas are overheated. They point to Las Vegas and Southern California, for example, where speculators are "flipping" homes for profit shortly after buying them. In Las Vegas, 16.1% of all housing loans last year went to investors rather than those buying a primary residence, nearly double the national average, according to San Francisco research firm Loan Performance Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For our survey, Fiserv CSW looked at price changes for the five years ended in September for 1,237 ZIP codes across the country -- areas where median home sales were higher than in surrounding areas, and where 100 or more home transactions had typically been recorded. Overall, home prices in these areas were up 14.7% in the year ended September 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, neighborhoods in the West showed the strongest growth, but grew only half as fast in the Northwest, still reeling from the tech-industry slowdown. In the South, coastal towns performed the best. Price gains in the Midwest and Southwest, with the exception of bright spots like Scottsdale, Ariz., and Oak Park, Ill., were sluggish. And the priciest town in America? In our survey, it's Santa Monica, Calif., with a median home price of $1.928 million -- up nearly 30% in the last year alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Rockville, Md., homeowner Bryan Hubbard says local home prices have grown "much faster than I anticipated." Mr. Hubbard, a spokesman for the U.S. Defense Department, says he's now asking $990,000 for his seven-bedroom Victorian home in the Washington, D.C., suburb, double what he paid for it four years ago, and is marketing the home without the help of a real-estate agent. If his family moved into town today, Mr. Hubbard adds, "I don't think we'd be able to afford the house we have."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Life is short -- max out your credit cards," reads the sign in a jeweler in this seaside town, situated on a two-mile barrier island in the Gulf of Mexico. Once a sleepy retirement mecca and vacation retreat for the likes of Clarence Darrow and Al Capone, the 17,000-resident town is benefiting from the growing local tech industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home prices here have more than doubled in five years, to $410,000, as foreign investors take advantage of a weak dollar and bidding wars are common. New condominium projects are pulling median prices up even more, with starting prices of around $700,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathleen Johnson, formerly a real-estate investor in San Francisco, scouted areas along the Gulf of Florida before settling in St. Pete Beach five years ago. She bought two properties in 2002 -- a waterfront condo for $197,000 and an inland home for $239,000 -- and sold them last year for a combined $164,000 gain. Many neighbors, she says, are also speculating in real estate. "It's easy to find the buyers," she says, but "harder and harder to find the homes."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SIDEWALK VIEW: Hobbit village by a lake</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This bedroom community eight miles south of downtown Portland is one of the best-performing areas in the Northwest, which has seen slowdowns in the software, aerospace and lumber industries. Once a steel town, Lake Oswego now has a series of sloped-roof, English-style cottages surrounded by a dense pine forest. Construction crews are everywhere, adding new turrets to Tudor-style mansions or demolishing cottages. A downtown renovation is transforming old industrial areas into parks and offices. "There's some big money out here, and they don't want to look" at auto shops and machinery, says local architect Ray Totten.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, 54 homes sold for more than $1 million here -- but the only people with access to the lake are homeowners with frontage property. Most of the buyers for the area's homes (median price last year: $525,000) are year-round residents who instead say they're attracted to the area's top-ranked schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Physician Arthur Rott wants to sell the 3,100-square-foot home where he's lived for 15 years, but he's not sure if he should bother to update the kitchen and baths. Looking out his bay window at a home being torn down across the street, he says, "My house is a perfect `Leave It To Beaver' kind of place -- but that's not enough around here anymore."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's not a McDonald's or Burger King anywhere along the 10-block stretch of road bordering the lake in Wayzata, Minn., and "two cars at a stop sign count as a traffic jam," says real-estate broker Keith Anderson. Just 12 miles west of Minneapolis, Wayzata is the gateway to Lake Minnetonka, one of the most popular recreation spots in the state. Residents spend their summers sailing, riding the red-and-gold trolley to the town center or cruising on a restored 1906 steamboat, the Minnehaha.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This quaintness comes at a price. The 4,100-resident town had one of the highest rates of appreciation in the state over the last five years. At $522,000, the median home price is almost 2 1/2 times that of the surrounding area, and brick and Tudor-style mansions here have sold for up to $12 million. Some critics worry about young professionals buying up remaining buildable lots to put up big homes that lack small-town character. Says architect Sarah Susanka: "They're grander, but blander."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just 20 miles northwest of the White House, Rockville is one of the newer stops on the Washington, D.C., Metro line and one of the capital's major bedroom communities. The 200-year-old town includes Victorian-era homes and a historic cemetery -- F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda, are buried there -- but the town's overall feel is more modern. The main thoroughfare is lined with strip malls, and known for its near-daily traffic jams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(MORE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of Rockville's 55,000 residents work for the federal government, but technology is a growing presence. In the last year, the area added 615,000 square feet of office space, more than twice the amount of neighboring Gaithersburg. Planners are also demanding some more pedestrian-friendly projects: In the town's center, a $353 million redevelopment is under way to create a leafy plaza -- the plan is to hold a farmer's market there -- surrounded by red-brick buildings for a library and shops. Another developer has hired architect Andres Duany, founder of the New Urbanist movement, to design a center that will mix residential lofts, offices and stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On average, homes in Rockville (median price in our survey: $485,000) are selling for 99.7% of their asking price, says real-estate agent Wendy Banner -- well above the more typical national level of 90% to 95%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long considered the poor cousin of tonier New Jersey suburbs such as nearby Short Hills, Montclair is now one of the fastest-appreciating places in the state -- with a median home price of $410,000 in this ZIP code. Brokers say one big draw is its magnet schools: Residents can choose to send their children to any of the town's schools, which specialize in subjects like international studies and science. Last year's addition of a direct-line train to midtown Manhattan also boosted housing demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite New York's proximity and some famous residents -- Hall of Fame Yankee catcher Yogi Berra, cosmetics-company founder Bobbi Brown -- Montclair's tone is small-town retro, with wide sidewalks, streetlights and stores like the Soda Pop Shop. Come spring, shop owners compete to create the prettiest flower basket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Montclair's boom has been relatively recent, many of its dated houses need considerable work. Sybil Eng, an epidemiologist who commutes to New York, paid $811,000 for a six-bedroom, 1927 colonial last summer, even though it needed renovations -- starting with the cracked bathroom tiles, white linoleum kitchen floors and oven too small for a Thanksgiving turkey.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SIDEWALK VIEW: Luxury living creeps into low-key town</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the old song suggests, every spring the swallows return to Capistrano. Homeowners have flocked here for a different reason: While the 7,445-population town has only a handful of businesses and few local jobs, the beachfront area has become increasingly desirable as prices have grown in better-known neighboring towns. One of the most expensive homes in Orange County is next door in Monarch Beach, a $30 million mansion owned by Stephen Udvar-Hazy, founder of International Lease Finance Corp. A few miles to the north in picturesque Laguna Niguel, six properties are currently for sale for more than $10 million. But an oceanfront home in Capistrano Beach recently sold for $6 million. "Around here, that's relatively affordable," says real-estate agent Joe Smith.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In downtown "Capo Beach," as the locals call it, the dominant business is the thatched Coconuts restaurant, and many of the homes are custom-made, with touches like navy blue tile trim, leaded windows or widow's walks. Even with the price spikes, most homes sell swiftly, agents say. But there's some evidence that the speculative froth may be subsiding. Contractor Larry Sackett, who says he "flipped" about 43 houses here during Southern California's boom of 1988-1993, says he isn't buying anything now. "I think the market is past its peak," he says. "I don't want to get burned."</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>788 words</div><div>10 February 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices appear to be excessive in more than a dozen U.S. cities, including San Francisco, Miami and Los Angeles, according to a study by one of the nation's largest mortgage lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, home prices are at what seem to be bargain levels in cities such as Albuquerque, N.M.; Memphis, Tenn.; and Salt Lake City, says the study by economists at National City Corp., a Cleveland banking company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no sign of a national "bubble" in home prices, says Richard DeKaser, chief economist at National City, but "there is a growing risk of `bubblettes' in certain places."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. DeKaser studied data for the past 25 years on 99 metropolitan areas to determine price levels that would be expected for each city based on such factors as population density, incomes, interest rates and past premiums or discounts compared with other parts of the country. He then looked at the difference between those expected levels and actual house prices in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chico, Calif., a small city in an almond-growing area about 90 miles north of Sacramento, is the most overvalued area, with house prices 43% above the expected price level, the study found. Eight of the top 10 cities deemed overvalued were in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some other cities where prices have been rising fast were nonetheless closer to expected levels. New York was 16% above the expected level, while Boston was 14% above; Chicago, 11%; and Washington, D.C., 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets with an overvaluation of 20% or more account for about a fifth of the total U.S. housing stock, according to the study. In most of the country, Mr. DeKaser says, houses have remained affordable, largely because low interest rates have held down monthly mortgage payments. On a national basis, 22% of the median household income was needed to meet payments on the typical single-family home last year, he says. That's down from an average of about 35% in the 1980s, when interest rates were much higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metropolitan areas where prices appear excessive face the risk of falling prices, Mr. DeKaser says, but that doesn't mean prices necessarily will decline. "The true test of today's premiums in these markets will be the economic environment, especially incomes and interest rates, in the years ahead," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. DeKaser acknowledges that his research couldn't include all factors that may explain differences in price appreciation. For instance, house buyers in California have been faster than those elsewhere to embrace "interest only" loans that let borrowers delay paying back the principal, allowing them to buy more expensive homes than would otherwise be possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in Chico have risen fast partly because the city has attracted people from the coastal areas of California looking for a more "laid-back lifestyle," says Rodney Krebs, a broker associate at Coldwell Banker DuFour Realty, a local brokerage firm. Land available for development is scarce, and builders haven't been able to keep up with demand, he says. Locals with relatively modest incomes have trouble competing for houses with newcomers flush with cash from selling homes in high-cost areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Salt Lake City, a loss of technology jobs and a slowdown of business activity after the 2002 Olympics helped hold down house price gains in recent years, says Jaren L. Davis, president of the Utah Association of Realtors. He predicts that affordable housing will draw more employers to Utah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Gellhausen, an executive vice president responsible for consumer lending at National City, says the banking company is using the data in analyzing its portfolio of loans but doesn't plan to reduce lending in the areas deemed overvalued. He says most mortgage loans made by National City are sold to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other investors. National City's First Franklin subprime-lending unit has a big presence in California.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ray A. Smith </div><div>474 words</div><div>10 February 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing condominiums and co-ops rose 8% in 2004, the ninth consecutive year of record sales -- and the median price for a condo exceeded the median price of a single-family home for the first time since such records were kept.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A total of 970,000 existing condos and co-ops were sold in 2004, according to the National Association of Realtors, up from the previous record of 898,000 units in 2003. The median condo price rose 17% to $193,600, a record high, from $164,100 in 2003. In contrast, the resale price for a single-family home was $184,100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year marked the first time since such numbers were tracked beginning in the 1980s that the median sales price of a condo in the U.S. surpassed that of a median home price. The median price of a condo also rose faster than the price of a home in 2004 -- 17% compared with 8.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The existing condo market is about one-seventh the size of the existing home market, and existing home sales actually grew slightly faster than existing condo sales last year. One reason condos have grown more expensive is that they tend to be located in more-expensive urban areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, the National Association of Realtors' chief economist, said the sales performance reflects the significance of condo sales in the overall housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The condo market has clearly matured over the last decade, accounting for a market share almost as big as the new-home market," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Celia Chen, a senior economist with forecasting and consulting firm Economy.com of West Chester, Pa., said she was surprised to see the 2004 median existing home price was lower than the existing condo price. "This says condo demand is very strong in downtown urban areas, and some of that may be due to empty nesters returning to urban cores and driving up demand for luxury apartment buildings," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Chen and others, including the National Association of Realtors, stress that strong national prices may be skewed somewhat by condo-heavy markets, such as New York and Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fourth quarter of 2004 marked the second quarter since the early 1980s that the price of a condo exceeded the price of a home. The median price of a condo rose 16.7% in the fourth quarter to $203,200. The typical single-family home cost $187,500 in the fourth quarter, 8.8% higher than a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the fourth quarter of 2003, the median price of a condo surpassed the price of single-family home but just in that quarter, not for the full year. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. manufacturing sector continued to expand in January and manufacturing employment appears to be on the rise, according to a survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, which polls purchasing agents at more than 400 industrial companies, said its index of manufacturing activity slipped to 56.4 in January from a revised reading of 57.3 in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the index remained in positive territory, representing the 20th consecutive month of U.S. manufacturing growth. Readings above 50 indicate the sector is expanding. The ISM index is closely watched by economists and financial markets because it provides an early look at economic activity in the preceding period and has a track record of corresponding to changes in the health of the nation's industrial core.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norbert Ore, chairman of the institute's survey committee, said the January index reflects continued strength in manufacturing, following robust growth in 2004. Among the month's positive readings are relatively strong production growth, less concern about price inflation and a strong willingness by manufacturers to add jobs, Mr. Ore said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"January sets the tone for a strong first quarter," he said. "Demand for exports continues to be quite strong, with a number of industries reporting significant growth."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM's new-order index fell to 56.5 in January from 62.6 in December, but the production index rose to 57.8 last month from 56.7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The employment index jumped to 58.1 in January from 53.3 the month before. "The tally ranks as among the best, raising the prospect of a solid gain in the manufacturing component of payroll employment," said Michael Moran, an economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 20 industries tracked by the ISM, 12 reported growth in January, including primary metals, furniture and rubber and plastics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the U.S. Commerce Department said total construction spending rose 1.1% in December to a seasonally adjusted rate of $1.032 trillion. November spending was revised upward to a 0.3% gain from the 0.4% decline originally reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private residential spending rebounded 0.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $567.6 billion, after a revised flat performance in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public construction spending increased 1.8% to $242.8 billion after a 2.3% advance the prior month. Federal government construction outlays rose 6.6%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- The U.S. manufacturing sector grew for the 20th consecutive month in January, though at a moderated pace, a private research group reported, affirming the rebound in activity at the nation's factories.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management said its index measuring manufacturing activity declined to 56.4 in January, from a revised reading of 57.3 in December. The January figure was slightly below the reading of 57 expected by analysts. A reading of 50 or above in the index means the manufacturing sector is expanding, while a figure below 50 represents a contraction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute's manufacturing data offer the first comprehensive look at U.S. factory activity for the prior month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norbert J. Ore, chairman of the institute's survey committee, said the January index reflects strength in manufacturing, with production and employment picking up. "January sets the tone for a strong first quarter. Even though the [index] is slightly lower, the month-over-month growth is still quite strong, and will provide significant momentum for the remainder" of the quarter, Mr. Ore said. "Demand for exports continues to be quite strong, with a number of industries reporting significant growth."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other economic news, the U.S. Commerce Department reported that construction spending in the U.S. rose 1.1% in December, making last year the best for building activity since 1996. The December increase was the sector's best showing in eight months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the year, building activity increased 9% to $998.4 billion, the largest increase since a 10.4% rise in 1996.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM, based in Tempe, Arizona, said its index measuring production increased to 57.8 in January from 56.7. A separate index gauging employment rose to 58.1 from 53.3 in December.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group's measure of new orders declined to 56.5 in January from 62.6 the previous month. In addition, ISM's index of prices paid by manufacturers declined to 69 from 72 in December, showing some easing in the pace of increases in prices for the materials they use.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, of the 20 manufacturing sectors surveyed by the group, 12 reported growth. They include primary metals, furniture, rubber and plastic products, transportation and equipment, industrial and commercial equipment and computers, instruments and photographic equipment, miscellaneous, textiles, chemicals, electronic components and equipment, apparel and food.  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Personal Income Climbs Steeply --- Microsoft Payout Credited With Contributing to Rise; Holiday Sales Saw Boost</span>
</div><div class="author">By Kemba J. Dunham </div><div>658 words</div><div>1 February 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans' personal income shot up in December, boosted by a large dividend payment to shareholders of computer-software titan Microsoft Corp. that arrived just in time to stoke holiday spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Commerce Department said the $32 billion dividend payment caused total personal income to rise 3.7% in December from the previous month -- the largest monthly gain since the government began tracking the data in 1959. Excluding the dividend, personal income rose 0.6% in December, up from a revised 0.4% gain in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even without the dividend, economists said, income growth was strong in December, pushing up retail sales to a hefty 8.7% month-to-month rise -- the strongest holiday sales gains since 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The consumer ended the year spending like crazy, and with the help of Microsoft, they had the money to spend," Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors Inc. said in an e-mail to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce report found personal-consumption expenditures rose 0.8% in December, twice the previous month's pace. Incentive-driven gains in motor-vehicle sales fueled the December rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said it's rare for one company's dividend payment to have such a huge impact on national income figures. Michael Moran, an economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. in New York, says there are several instances of large dividend payments having an impact on personal income in the 1970s, "but the magnitude was nowhere close to what we saw in December," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Microsoft payment, which affected 4.6 million shareholders, was nearly as large as the $38 billion federal income-tax rebate paid in the summer of 2001. But unlike the rebate, which many Americans spent, economists said the dividend will have a smaller impact on spending because much of it will be reinvested in stocks or left in brokerage accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said that due to a miscalculation by Canada's statistics agency, over $1 billion of Canadian imports from the U.S. were undercounted in November. That means the recently reported estimate of the U.S. exports and of U.S. gross domestic product may have been understated. The government agency said the correction will have an impact on calculations of the November trade balance and fourth-quarter GDP, but it didn't provide details on the nature or size of the change. On Friday, the BEA said real GDP grew at annual rate of 3.1% in the fourth quarter, weaker than many economists expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the year, personal income rose 5.4% in 2004, up from 3.2% a year earlier. Consumer spending rose 6.1% for the year, up from 5.2% a year earlier. Wages and salaries grew 0.4% in December, up from 0.2% a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inflation news in the report was also encouraging. A price index for personal-consumption expenditures excluding food and energy was flat during December, compared with the prior month. The rate climbed 0.2% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Census Bureau said newly constructed single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.098 million units in December. That was up 0.1% from November and down 2% when compared with December 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of a new home continued to rise. In December, the average price was $276,600 and the median price was $222,000. The median is the midway price, half of all homes sell for more than the median and half sell for less.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The personal income of Americans shot up during December in its biggest increase ever, elevated by the payment of a special dividend to shareholders by Microsoft Corp.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal income increased 3.7%, after rising a revised 0.4% in November, the U.S. Commerce Department said yesterday. Income was originally estimated to rise 0.3%. Excluding the Microsoft dividend, personal income rose 0.6%, which still "suggests that income growth was strong in December," said John Ryding, chief U.S. economist for the investment bank Bear Stearns Cos.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The huge increase was the largest gain since monthly records began in 1959. The report showed personal dividend income was boosted $298.2 billion at an annual rate -- or $24.8 billion at a monthly rate -- by the special dividend. Dividend income climbed 301.7% at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in December, after rising 3.4% in November.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the year, personal income -- also skewed by the Microsoft dividend -- rose 5.4%, up from 3.2% in 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal consumption rose 0.8%, after climbing a revised 0.4%. Spending was initially seen going up 0.2% in November. The December gain was driven by an incentive-induced jump in motor-vehicle sales. Consumer spending rose 6.1% for the year, up from 5.2% the previous year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wages and salaries grew 0.4% in December, up from 0.2% a month earlier. The increase reflected the modest rise in jobs, a longer workweek for the holidays and soft earnings growth during the month, some economists say. For the year, wages and salaries grew 5.2%, up from 3.6% the previous year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inflation news in the report was also encouraging. A price index for personal-consumption expenditures excluding food and energy was flat during December, compared with the prior month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate climbed 0.2% in November.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year-to-year, personal-consumption expenditures minus food and energy rose 1.5% in December, compared with December 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year-to-year rise in November was 1.6%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department also said sales of new single-family homes increased 0.1% in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.098 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November home sales fell 13.1% as the government lowered the annual rate to 1.097 million from an earlier estimate of 1.125 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists predicted a bigger increase for the month. While wet weather damped sales in November, "the absence of a December rebound is puzzling," said Steve Wood, chief economist at Insight Economics in Danville, California.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the year, new-home sales reached an unadjusted 1.183 million annual rate, 8.9% higher than 2003's 1.086 million.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumer confidence rose in January for the second month in a row, but there remain concerns about economic conditions in the months ahead, the Conference Board said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The private research group said its consumer-confidence index rose 0.7% to 103.4 from an upwardly revised 102.7 in December. The gain came as a surprise; the median finding of economists in a survey conducted by was for a reading of 101.5, a decline from the previous month. The Conference Board report is based on a mail-in survey of 5,000 U.S. households.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board said its present-situation index, a gauge of consumers' assessment of current economic activity, rose to 110.9 from 105.7 in the previous month. Consumer expectations for the state of economic activity during the next six months dropped to 98.4 from 100.7.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Despite the slight retreat in expectations, consumers' short-term outlook remains favorable and suggests the economy will continue to expand throughout the first half of the year," said Lynn Franco, a Conference Board economist.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some economists point out that consumers were more optimistic at the beginning of 2004. Despite recent improvements, "confidence seems fragile, driven by shifting opinions about the labor market and gasoline prices," said Steve Wood, chief economist at Insight Economics in Danville, California. "For there to be a sustained rise in confidence, job creation will have to accelerate."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. sales of previously occupied homes in December fell 3.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of nearly 6.7 million units, the National Association of Realtors said. The revised November level of 6.9 million equaled the record set in June 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our sense was that November sales were the peak for the current housing cycle, but activity remains strong," said David Lereah, the NAR's chief economist.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of homes on the market declined 12% in December to nearly 2.2 million, partly reflecting the normal seasonal slowdown of listings. At the current rate of sales, the NAR said, that supply is enough to last 3.9 months, the lowest since the association began tracking the number in 1982.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A measure of U.S. consumer confidence rose in January for the second month in a row, despite lingering worries about whether the economy will lose steam in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board, a private research group, said its consumer-confidence index rose 0.7% to 103.4 from an upwardly revised 102.7 in December. The median finding of economists in a survey conducted by was for a reading of 101.5. The Conference Board report is based on a mail-in survey of 5,000 U.S. households.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a good sign in terms of consumer spending," said Lynn Franco, director of the board's consumer-research center. "Consumers remain optimistic that the economy is going to continue to grow in the first half of 2005."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board said its present-situation index, a gauge of consumers' assessment of current economic activity, rose to 110.9 from 105.7 in the previous month. The index is at its highest level since May 2002. The employment picture was also favorable, with the percentage of consumers saying jobs are plentiful increasing to 20.7% from 19.4%. Those claiming jobs are hard to get fell to 24.7% to 26.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers are feeling slightly cautious about the next six months, however. The expectation index, an assessment of the state of economic activity during the next six months, dropped to 98.4 from 100.7. Consumers believed the outlook for jobs, business activity and income growth had deteriorated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists says consumers may be hedging because they already have loaded up on credit-card debt, realize that interest rates are rising and know that the job market isn't as strong as it was in the late 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can count on the consumer to keep the economy growing this year, but we can't count on the consumer to accelerate that growth," said Anthony Chan, an economist at JP Morgan Fleming Asset Management, a unit of J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. sales of previously occupied homes in December fell 3.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of nearly 6.7 million units, the National Association of Realtors said. The revised November level of 6.9 million equaled the record set in June 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our sense was that November sales were the peak for the current housing cycle, but activity remains strong," said David Lereah, the NAR's chief economist. For the full year, the NAR reported a record 6.7 million home sales, up 9.4% from a year earlier. The NAR's Mr. Lereah predicted that sales will slow to about 6.5 million this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median price for previously owned homes was $188,900 in December, up 8.1% from a year earlier, the NAR said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of previously occupied homes on the market declined 12% in December to about 2.2 million. At the current rate of sales, the NAR said, that supply is enough to last only 3.9 months, the lowest since the association began tracking the number in 1982.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of last year's third quarter, vacant homes available for sale stood at 1.08% of the nation's total housing stock, up from a range of about 0.8% to 1% in most of the 1990s. If the pace of sales slows as interest rates rise, the backlog of unsold homes could become a drag on the market, said Rick T. Murray, an analyst at Raymond James &amp;Associates Inc., a securities firm in St. Petersburg, Fla.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>702 words</div><div>20 January 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts jumped 11% in December from the prior month, underscoring builders' confidence that the market will remain solid in 2005 despite a growing chorus of warnings that prices have risen too fast in some parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builders seem quite upbeat," said David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, adding that the latest data show there has been no "fundamental weakening" in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department estimated that builders began work on privately owned homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of two million units in December, up 11% from 1.81 million in November but down 3% from a year earlier. In November, starts plunged 12% from a month earlier, but Mr. Seiders said that was partly due to heavy rain in much of the country. He described the December performance as a "snapback."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are poised to keep firing their nail guns at a rapid clip: Building permits for privately owned homes were recorded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.02 million in December, down 0.3% from November but up 2.1% from a year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of 2004, builders broke ground on an estimated 1.95 million housing units, up 5.7% from 2003, the department said. Last year's total was the highest since 1978. For 2005, Mr. Seiders forecast a decline of about 3.6% in starts, to 1.88 million. That would still leave them at the second highest level since 1978.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Seiders and other housing-industry economists who took part in a news briefing yesterday said they expect modest increases in interest rates this year. The rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages is likely to rise to 6.75% by year end from about 5.75% now, Mr. Seiders said. David Berson, chief economist at Fannie Mae, forecast a rise to just 6.3% -- far below the averages of 8.2% in the 1990s and 12.7% in the 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While higher rates will make monthly payments steeper, the economists said they expect fairly strong growth in jobs and wages to offset the rising cost of borrowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new and previously occupied homes are likely to decline 7% to 8% this year from last year's record 7.75 million, Mr. Berson said. He also forecast that the national average house price will rise 3% to 4% in 2005, down from an estimated 10% to 11% in 2004. In some areas, he said, prices could decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The forecasts for a cooling market are remarkably similar to those of a year ago. Those forecasts proved wrong when interest rates stayed surprisingly low and helped keep home sales brisk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason to be more cautious about home prices this year, Mr. Berson said, is that more investors have jumped into the market. LoanPerformance Inc., a San Francisco-based research firm, says 8.4% of purchase-mortgages in the first 10 months of 2004 went to people who didn't plan to occupy the homes, mostly investors. That was up from 7.6% for all of 2003 and 5.8% in 2000. Mr. Berson expects fewer investor purchases in 2005 and says some investors may seek to cash out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason for caution is that the supply of homes has been growing. The number of new single-family homes for sale in November was 424,000, up 16% from a year earlier, according to the Commerce Department. Mr. Seiders said he has been warning builders about the risk of overbuilding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists outside the industry are less confident that the market will remain firm. In a research note earlier this month, Andrew Tilton, an economist at Goldman, Sachs &amp;Co. in New York, said the expected rise in interest rates this year "would have a chilling effect on home prices. This would likely take the form of an extended period of flattish prices in many regions, with outright declines more likely in the hottest coastal markets." </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">CPI Rose at Fast Clip, Erasing Many Pay Gains</span>
</div><div class="author">By Kemba J. Dunham </div><div>674 words</div><div>20 January 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer-price inflation during 2004 rose at the fastest pace in four years, essentially wiping out wage gains for many American workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday that its consumer-price index -- the most widely followed barometer of inflation -- rose 3.3% last year, the largest gain since 2000. The core rate of inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, rose 2.2% last year. While those rates of inflation remain mild by historical standards, they are up sharply from 2003 when the overall CPI rose 1.9% and the core rate was up 1.1%. For the month of December, inflation eased as the CPI declined 0.1% compared with the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year-over-year numbers "were not wildly surprising given the way things ended in 2003, when the rate of inflation was unsustainably low," says Joshua Shapiro, an economist with MFR Inc., a New York-based economic-advisory firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though inflation remains low, it was high enough last year to offset the gains in worker wages. According to a separate Labor Department report, when adjusted for inflation, hourly earnings for private nonfarm workers declined 0.7% last month from a year earlier. Average weekly earnings in December were $537.08, down 0.1% from a year earlier when adjusted for inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're three years into a recovery with strong productivity growth, yet many in the working class are falling behind, which suggests that inequalities are embedded in the recovery at this stage," said Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive Washington-based think tank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slow rise in earnings didn't stop consumers from spending, but economists say this could eventually change. The Federal Reserve, in its latest report of economic conditions across the country, said consumer spending was generally higher in December when compared with November but that inflation remained in check. "Labor markets firmed in a number of districts, but wage pressures generally remained modest," the Fed said in its "beige book" report, adding that most districts "reported steady or only slightly higher overall prices." Economic growth continued in 11 of the 12 Federal Reserve districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CPI report showed that consumer prices rose sharply during 2004 for a number of products. Energy prices, for example, rose 16.6%, led largely by oil prices, which were up 26.7%. Transportation prices were up 6.5%, partly due to rising costs for new and used cars. Prices for medical costs rose 4.2% and hotel costs were up 5.1%. The only major category to show a decline for the year was apparel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the December CPI suggests that inflation has eased after surging for much of last year. The small decline last month was the first dip in five months, which mostly reflected dropping energy prices and stable food prices. The core index rose 0.2% for a third month in a row. December declines were broad-based.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Labor Department said the number of U.S. workers filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits for the week ended Saturday decreased 48,000 to 319,000 from the previous week's unrevised figure of 367,000. The four-week moving average was 341,000, a decrease of 3,000 from the previous week's unrevised average of 344,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report, the Commerce Department said December housing starts increased 10.9% to a seasonally adjusted 2.004 million annual rate. For the entire year, an estimated 1.953 million housing units were started, 5.7% above 2003's 1.847 million. Building permits decreased 0.3% in December to a 2.021 million annual rate. For 2004, an estimated 2.018 million housing units were authorized by building permits, a 6.8% increase from the previous year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. consumer prices fell for the first time in five months in December as oil prices dropped, suggesting that inflation has eased after surging for much of 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consumer-price index fell 0.05% last month, the Labor Department said. The decline mostly reflected falling energy prices and stable food prices. The core index, which excludes those items, rose by 0.15% for the third month in a row.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street had expected overall consumer prices to be stable in December, although forecasters accurately predicted the 0.2% increase in the core index. The numbers were consistent with the Federal Reserve's view that inflation is "well contained."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the course of 2004, consumer prices rose 3.3%, the fastest pace in four years, the Labor Department said. Fed policy makers have said much of that increase reflected surging oil prices in the first 10 months of the year. But core prices also showed a big gain in annual terms -- a 2.2% increase that was the largest since 2001.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed policy makers recently have debated whether inflation is likely to heat up because of the dollar's decline against other major currencies. But most Fed officials say they don't think a further surge in inflation is likely.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I expect inflation will remain subdued in 2005," Gary Stern, a member of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee said Tuesday. But Fed officials also say they intend to keep raising interest rates gradually to make sure inflation does stay tame.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed policy makers meet Feb. 1 and Feb. 2 to decide the course of interest rates. Wall Street widely expects them to raise the key federal funds rate a quarter percentage point to 2.5%. Many economists expect at least four more increases of that magnitude during 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its report, the Labor Department said energy prices fell 1.8% in December, marking the biggest decline since July. Gasoline prices fell 3.7% in the biggest decline since October 2003. Prices of natural gas, however, rose 1%. Food prices were steady for the first time in three months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Labor Department said the number of U.S. workers filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits for the week ended Jan. 15 decreased 48,000 to 319,000 from the previous week's unrevised figure of 367,000. The four-week moving average was 341,000 -- a decrease of 3,000 from the previous week's unrevised average of 344,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report, the Commerce Department said December housing starts increased 10.9% to a seasonally adjusted two million annual rate. For the entire year, an estimated 1.953 million housing units were started, 5.7% above 2003's 1.847 million; the annual figures are not seasonally adjusted.  </p>

</div><div class="author">Rising Home Prices Outpace  Incomes in Many Areas; Interest-Only Loans Surge ---- By Ruth Simon </div><div>1494 words</div><div>12 January 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices during the past year have made it substantially harder for buyers to get their foot in the door in half of the nation's 30 largest metro areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the conclusion of a study that ranked 325 metropolitan areas by their affordability. The study, by forecasting and consulting firm Economy.com, found that in nearly 30 metro areas nationwide, prices are so high that someone earning the median income can't afford a median-price home, based on traditional lending standards. That is a remarkable finding given that mortgage rates remain near historical lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other measures also suggest affordability is dropping. Just more than half of the homes sold in the U.S. during the third quarter were affordable to families earning the median income, according to the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Opportunity Index, which looks at sales of both new and existing homes. That's down from about 61% for the first quarter of 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordability -- a measure of the ability of the average household to buy a home at current mortgage rates -- has long been an issue for low-income buyers. But in some markets, such as Salinas, Calif., New York City and Honolulu, prices have increased so rapidly that buyers with healthier incomes are feeling the squeeze as well. And the number of such markets could climb if mortgage rates rise this year, as many economists expect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in affordability helps explain the rise of lending programs -- such as interest-only mortgages and 100% financing -- that help buyers get into a home they couldn't otherwise afford. In some of the least-affordable markets, including Salinas and Santa Cruz, Calif., interest-only mortgages accounted for more than 60% of mortgages taken out to buy homes last year, according to an analysis done for The Wall Street Journal by LoanPerformance in San Francisco, which tracks 46 million mortgages monthly. Nationwide, interest-only loans accounted for about one-third of home-purchase mortgages in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If interest rates rise, some buyers who stretched their purchasing power with adjustable-rate loans and interest-only mortgages could face financial problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many parts of the country, affordability isn't much of a problem. The National Association of Realtors' Affordability Index stood at 131.7 in November, a slight decrease from the previous month. (When the index is at 100, it means that the median income family has the exact amount needed to purchase the median-price existing home, with 20% down and a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"By and large, when you look at the affordability index it is still very healthy," says David Lereah, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. In many areas where affordability is an issue, the supply of homes for sale isn't large enough to meet demand, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising interest rates could make affordability an issue in more areas. Sixteen metro areas, including Bergen County, N.J., Providence, R.I., Boulder, Colo., and Seattle, would become unaffordable for someone earning the median income if rates on 30-year fixed rate mortgages rise soon to 7%, according to Economy.com. If mortgage rates jump to 8%, the list would expand to 18 more metro areas, including Portland, Maine, Baltimore, and Charleston, S.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the pain is greatest for entry-level buyers. In the Miami area, "the first-time home for many people will be a condominium," says Ron Shuffield, president of Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As home prices rise, many first-time buyers are finding they don't have enough cash for a down payment. Some turn to relatives for help. Many others are opting for 100% financing. In Jersey City, N.J., roughly three-quarters of first-time buyers put down 5% or less of the purchase price, says Laura Skolar, manager of Century 21 Plaza Realty Corp. "If we get someone coming in with 10% or 20% down, we feel like we've hit pay dirt," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jean Manner Schwimmer, of Coldwell Banker Gay Dales in Salinas, Calif., says that more than 90% of her first-time home buyers put no money down. In Salinas, a household earning the median income can afford to buy just 49% of the median-price home, down from 61% during the first quarter of 2003, according to Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Len Filippoff opted for 100% financing when he purchased a $509,000 three-bedroom home in Salinas last summer. "When prices started going up, we started to panic," says Mr. Filippoff, a manager for Costco Wholesale. "We thought we were going to be priced out of the market. We had some money saved, but we didn't have the 10% most lenders were looking for." To help keep his monthly payments in check, Mr. Filippoff also chose an interest-only mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some high-cost markets, buyers trading up are also feeling the pinch. "We're seeing an awful lot of well-qualified move-up buyers who are stretching," says John Karevoll, a housing analyst for DataQuick Information Systems in La Jolla, Calif. "Instead of putting 20% down, they are putting 10% down. Instead of a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, they're taking a seven-year adjustable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other creative solutions. Robert Hale, a fixed-income portfolio analyst in Boston, figured he would be able to afford only a 1,200-square-foot condo on his $350,000 budget. So Mr. Hale and his wife teamed up with a friend and purchased a 3,500-square-foot, two-family house in Brighton, Mass., for $685,000 and are splitting it into two condominiums. Such conversions are becoming more popular in the Boston area, says Mr. Hale's broker, Jeffrey Heighton of Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in Brookline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Las Vegas, declining affordability has spurred a wave of condominium conversions as developers seek to appeal to entry-level buyers who have been priced out of the market. At least 8,000 apartment units will be converted into condos this year, up from roughly 3,000 last year, says Dennis Smith, president of Home Builders Research Inc., which tracks the Las Vegas housing market. "Until 2004, apartment conversions to condos were . . . basically nonexistent," he adds.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ray A. Smith </div><div>628 words</div><div>12 January 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B12</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE WEST COAST, and California in particular, dominate the rankings of the apartment markets with the best growth prospects for this year, according to a new report that ranks 42 markets throughout the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four of the top five markets are in Southern California. A total of six Western markets are in the top 10. Riverside-San Bernardino topped the list, moving up three spots from its 2004 ranking, followed by San Diego, Orange County (which dropped from No. 1), Las Vegas and Los Angeles. Oakland took the 10th spot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington, D.C.; Boston; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; and New York City ranked sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth, respectively. Markets in the South and Midwest mostly ranked toward the bottom of the list, largely because they continued to struggle with supply issues, a weak labor market or both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These findings are included in Marcus &amp;Millichap Real Estate Investment Brokerage Co.'s 2005 National Apartment Index. The Encino, Calif., brokerage firm's research division ranks markets based on a series of 12-month forward-looking supply and demand indicators. Markets are ranked based on their cumulative weighted-average scores for a number of things, including forecast employment growth, vacancy, construction, housing affordability and rent growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southern California's showing in the ranking isn't surprising, as apartment markets there held up well during the economic downturn. The region had high home prices, which tend to lead to strong renting activity, as many people in those areas find buying out of reach. The markets also have strong demographic trends and constraints on new construction, according to the index. Washington, D.C., also has shared many of these traits in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other markets had more significant moves. New York City, for example, rose to ninth place from 12th largely because of its exorbitant housing prices, which the index says should elevate rental demand and allow for strong rental growth. Seattle made the biggest positive move, rising eight places to 18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim Campbell, a broker with Pinnacle Management AMS LLC in Seattle, says that city's rental market is poised for a recovery, as hiring is picking up in the burgeoning biotech industry and as Microsoft Corp. and Boeing Co., which have long had presences there, have started hiring again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami, however, slipped 10 spots, the biggest drop, in part because of competition from affordable condos, which pushes people to buy rather than rent. Lyle Chariff, president of brokerage firm Chariff Realty Group in Miami, says investors should expect to lose money on apartment properties for the next year or two, with the hope they will make it back as the housing market slows. "They'll be taking a loss on the properties now but they'll be gaining appreciation later," he says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kemba J. Dunham </div><div>689 words</div><div>4 January 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. manufacturing sector is picking up momentum as a surge in orders from foreign and domestic buyers has prompted companies to boost production. But job growth in the sector remains weak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, an association of supply managers that polls purchasing agents at more than 400 industrial companies, said its monthly index of manufacturing activity jumped to 58.6 in December from 57.8 in November. The December reading was the highest in four months. Readings above 50 indicate the manufacturing sector is expanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We finished the year on a positive note, and we will be carrying some of that momentum over to 2005," says Norbert J. Ore, who heads the committee that conducts the ISM survey. The index began 2004 above 60 and remained above that level until August, when it slipped to 59. Still, Mr. Ore says the index average for 2004 was above 60 for the first time since 1973.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 20 industries tracked by the ISM, 14 reported growth in December, including the leather, furniture and food industries. Among the industries that saw no growth was fabricated metals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM index is closely watched by economists and the financial markets because it provides an early look at economic activity in the preceding period and has a long track record of corresponding to changes in the health of the nation's industrial core.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists were especially encouraged by the growth in new orders. The ISM's new-order index rose to 67.4 in December from 61.5 in November. It was the 20th consecutive month that the new-order index exceeded 50%. Growth was led by the furniture industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM report indicated that new orders were greatly influenced by U.S. exports, which appear to be rising because of the dollar's decline. In the past 12 months, the dollar has declined about 7% against the euro and 5% against the yen, giving American producers a competitive advantage over European and Japanese producers in those markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM's index for new export orders jumped to 60 last month from 54.7 the month before. "As the dollar softened there was an immediate effect on export orders," Mr. Ore says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other economists noted that if the trend continues, that could help narrow the U.S.'s wide trade deficit. "A growing export sector will provide additional demand and help stabilize the trade deficit as we produce more than we consume," says Dan Meckstroth, chief economist at the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a trade group in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say that December is typically a weak month for manufacturers' orders, so the health of the new-orders index is an indication that industrial production will see moderately strong growth for the first quarter of 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM's employment index showed a decline to 52.7 in December from 57.6 in November. Although the index remains above 50, it has dropped considerably from earlier months and indicates that manufacturers remain conservative in their hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Commerce Department said total construction spending fell 0.4% in November to a seasonally adjusted rate of $1.013 trillion. Spending rose an upwardly revised 0.3% in October, when it previously was seen as flat. This was the first decline since January 2004 and the biggest drop since spending decreased 0.8% in February 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction fell 0.3% to a seasonally adjusted rate of $562.6 billion after a revised 0.1% drop in October. But with interest rates still very low and new-home sales still strong, "home building is going to rebound, especially in the first half of 2005," says Steve Wood, chief economist at Insight Economics, an economics consulting firm in Danville, Calif.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Manufacturing activity in the U.S. expanded in December for the 19th consecutive month, a research group reported, suggesting that the industrial sector entered the new year with solid strength behind it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management said that its main index measuring U.S. industrial activity rose to 58.6 in December from November's 57.8. The December performance was slightly more robust than analysts had anticipated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reading of 50 or above in the index indicates the manufacturing sector is expanding, while a figure below 50 represents a contraction. The index has been above 50 since June 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norbert J. Ore, chairman of the institute's survey committee, said the December results were "driven by a significant increase in the new-orders index," which rose to 67.4 from November's 61.5. He added that the strong finish for 2004 meant that manufacturing had "significant momentum going into the first quarter of 2005."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the U.S. Commerce Department reported that construction spending declined 0.4% in November, the first drop in 10 months, as private builders reined in spending on residential and commercial projects.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures surprised some economists, who were forecasting a 0.5% increase in spending on building projects. Still, November's level of spending -- $1.01 trillion on an annualized basis -- was healthy, and construction activity for October turned out to be stronger than initially thought. Revised figures showed that spending for the month rose by 0.3%, compared with a flat reading first reported.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing-activity report from the Tempe, Arizona-based ISM is watched closely by investors because it is the first published data on economic activity each month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute's December price index fell to 72 from 74 for November. Mr. Ore said that "while there is continuing upward pressure on prices, the rate of increase is slowing and definitely trending in the right direction."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index of order backlogs, a signal of future demand, increased to 54 from 47.5 in November, while new export orders expanded to 60 from 54.7.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group's production index slipped to 56.9 from 57 in November, and an employment reading dropped to 52.7 from 57.6.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM report is compiled from surveys of purchasing and supply executives at more than 400 U.S. industrial companies. The survey includes data on supply shortages and price changes in a number of basic materials used in manufacturing, such as aluminum, latex, oil, steel and rubber.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report indicated growth in 14 of the 20 manufacturing categories tracked by the survey, including leather, computers, furniture, food, transportation and equipment, primary metals, chemicals, apparel and textiles.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing homes in the U.S. increased 2.7% to a record 6.94 million annual rate in November from October, the National Association of Realtors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Mortgage interest rates dropped a quarter of a percentage point in late summer and then stabilized," said David Lereah, NAR's chief economist. "Coupled with a growing labor market and a rising economy, this created optimal conditions for the housing sector."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of homes on the market was flat in November at 4.3 months of sales, the association said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price rose to $188,200, compared with a revised $185,400 in October. It was up 10% from November 2003. Sales were up 0.7% in the Midwest last month from October, 1.8% in the South and 6.5% in the West, but in the Northeast sales fell 1.3%. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. sales of previously owned homes posted their best month on record in November as low mortgage rates enticed buyers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said sales, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, totaled 6.94 million units, representing a 2.7% increase from October.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some other recent reports raised questions as to whether the high-flying U.S. housing market might be losing altitude, yesterday's report suggested the sector is still humming along.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The previous monthly record -- 6.92 million units -- was set in June. Sales of previously owned homes and new ones are on track to hit records for 2004, analysts said. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage was 5.73% in November, down from 5.93% a year earlier.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the "beige book" report at the start of December, several Federal Reserve district banks said that the pace of home sales had cooled and that this had led to a slowdown in price appreciation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two weeks later, the Commerce Department reported that the number of homes that ground was broken on fell by 13.1% from October to November -- the steepest decline in nearly 11 years. Last week, the Commerce Department said that sales of newly constructed homes declined by 12% in November -- the biggest drop in a decade -- while the number of unsold new homes on the market swelled to a 25-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of which will have investors looking a bit more closely at today's existing-home sales report from the National Association of Realtors. A decline on par with the ones seen in housing starts and new-home sales would be quite troubling. Fortunately, such a decline also is unlikely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, since so many more previously owned homes get sold in a month than new ones, existing-home sales don't exhibit nearly the same volatility that new ones do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, and more important, even if the slowdown that showed up in the new-home sales numbers is for real, it probably wouldn't turn up in existing-home sales until sometime in early 2005, points out Morgan Stanley chief U.S. economist Richard Berner. The reason: New-home sales are recorded on the day that contracts get signed, while existing-home sales are recorded on the day when the owner takes occupancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morgan Stanley's economists think that an annualized 6.7 million existing homes were sold in November, down about 0.7% from October's 6.75 million, but still 3% over the rate of the previous 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless of how the number comes in, Mr. Berner is reckoning on a cooler housing market in the coming year. Rising prices are pushing many prospective buyers out of the market, he says. And, as interest rates move up, even more people will find it difficult to afford a new home. At the same time, the U.S. homeownership rate has moved up by about five percentage points over the past decade to 69%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm not saying that everybody who wants a home is in one, but the pent-up demand has largely been satiated," he says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael Schroeder </div><div>690 words</div><div>24 December 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of big-ticket industrial goods increased briskly last month, indicating that growth in the manufacturing sector remains steady.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The durable-goods report showed that orders jumped 1.6% in November, and was one of several moderately upbeat reports released yesterday by the government. The Commerce Department also said orders in October declined a revised 0.9%. The decrease earlier had been put at 1.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, consumers increased their spending by 0.2% in November, less than the 0.8% increase in October. Personal income grew a modest 0.3% in November, down from a 0.6% rise the month before, the department reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors suggest that the economic expansion is likely to continue at a moderately strong pace next year, analysts said. The steady decline in the dollar is likely to accelerate the growth in U.S. manufacturing exports and hold down the rate of increase in imports. More-stable commodity prices, especially the recent drop in oil prices, is likely to ease pressure on profit margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This favorable business environment will encourage firms to buy capital equipment, an important generator of growth in the manufacturing sector," said Daniel Meckstroth, chief economist at the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a trade group in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the University of Michigan index that measures consumers' attitudes about the economy increased to 97.1 in December from 92.8 in November. Another index that focuses on consumers' expectations about the economy's future also rose, to 90.9 in December from 85.2 in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The durable-goods report showed that orders for autos, aircraft and other transportation goods increased 8.2% for the month, after rising just 0.3% in October. Excluding transportation goods, durable-goods orders fell 0.8%. Orders for computers posted a 4.2% decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, an indicator of future business-equipment investment, increased a strong 1.8% in November. That compared with a 4.1% decline in October, which had been estimated at a 3.6% drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other reports provided a mixed picture of economic activity. For example, consumer spending in November, when adjusted for inflation, was flat, compared with a solid rise of 0.4% in October. Wages and salaries increased a slim 0.2%, reflecting an anemic rise in jobs, a shorter workweek and soft earnings growth during the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The underlying personal-consumption-expenditures price index -- an inflation measure that is closely watched by the Federal Reserve -- climbed 0.1%, both on an overall basis and when food and energy were excluded. The total price index was up 2.6% from a year earlier, while the "core" index, which excludes food and energy, was up a modest 1.5% from a year earlier, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal saving edged up to 0.3% as a percentage of disposable personal income in November. That compared with 0.1% in October, which was the second-lowest monthly saving rate on record. This measure of saving excludes capital gains and losses such as on homes and stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another government report, new-home sales fell 12% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.125 million, the Commerce Department said. The figure represents a decline from robust October home sales, which were revised upward by more than 50,000 to a record 1.278 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And jobless claims jumped 17,000 to 333,000 during the week ended Dec. 18, the Labor Department said. Initial claims have been volatile in recent weeks but consistent with the underlying trend, suggesting little net change in the pace of layoffs. The four-week average rose 2,250 to 340,000, while continuing claims dropped 9,000 during the week ended Dec. 11 to 2.7 million, its second lowest level of the past 2 1/2 years. Over the past year, continuing claims have declined by 552,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp;Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A SECTION 1031 tax-deferred exchange allows the seller of real estate, or other properties held for business or investment purposes, to defer tax on profits from the sale by identifying a like investment within 45 days and concluding its transfer within 180 days. A graphic accompanying a Weekend Journal article Friday incorrectly said a seller has 60 days to identify a new property and as many as five years to conclude its transfer. The article also incorrectly described such exchanges as tax-free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ Dec. 29, 2004)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END) </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AT A RECENT CLOSING in Savannah, Ga., real-estate broker Joan Sumner brought Champagne for her clients. She has presented them with other gifts as well -- including flowers and a catered dinner. Ms. Sumner says the clients, John Meyers and Mary Truitt, are worth the trouble: In the past four years, she has helped them buy and sell five properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple, artists who are fairly new to real-estate investing, received some bigger perks as well. On one recent sale for Mr. Meyers and Ms. Truitt, Ms. Sumner trimmed her commission to 5% from the industry-standard 6%. "Clients like these keep me in business down here, so I have to keep them happy," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this robust housing market, brokers are looking for a new source of revenue -- repeat customers. With average home prices up 38% in the past five years, more mainstream buyers see real estate as an attractive investment. Brokers are trying to tap into that interest by building relationships that will last through several years and multiple properties. Some brokers are reducing their commissions by as much as a third on future sales, while others are offering rebates at the time of closing. Brokers are sweetening these deals with smaller perks as well, like keeping lawns mowed and refrigerators fully stocked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many brokers, it's a strategy to cope with an increasingly competitive market. Online real-estate agents with discounted commissions, in particular, have become a challenge to traditional brokers. Competition has also increased between brokers themselves, as newly licensed agents have flooded popular markets in recent years. In Florida, there are now 275,154 licensed brokers, according to the Association of Real Estate License Law Officials -- an increase of 83% since 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rise in repeat customers coincides with a surge in real-estate transactions nationally. Third-quarter home sales this year reached the second-highest pace on record, according to the National Association of Realtors. The group reports that 7.6 million units changed hands in the third quarter of 2004, up 4.1% from the same period a year ago. "Not since the 1980s have we seen this kind of rapid pace of sales," says Walter Molony, a spokesman for the group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR doesn't directly track flipping, the practice of buying and then selling a property in a short period of time to realize a profit. But an NAR study found that 7% of home sellers surveyed in 2003 owned their property for a year or less. That number was 3% in 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Francisco, broker Jim King of Frank Howard Allen Realtors says repeat customers now make up 60% of his customer base, up from nearly none five years ago. "Almost everyone realizes that the market is hot," says Mr. King. "And now you're seeing a lot of folks who are jumping in before things slow down." To cater to these customers, Mr. King has widened his search area, looking beyond the most sought-after neighborhoods for properties in areas that are on the verge of appreciating -- just the kind of place an individual investor might want to add to a portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new class of investors who are flipping properties is taking a calculated risk, of course, that the housing market will rise enough to make their investments worthwhile. In order for that to happen, a speculator has to take into account the various costs of buying and selling a property. A property purchased for $500,000 typically comes with 3% in closing costs. As sale fees can total as much as 7.5% (6% commission plus 1.5% in closing costs), an investor would have to sell the property for roughly $557,000 before realizing any profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some market observers, expressing concern about whether price growth can hold up, say investors should be cautious. "Everyday investors see prices as just going up," says Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, "but they should really be aware that in many places prices are completely out of line with market fundamentals."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers' strategies to court customers can go beyond the bottom line. San Diego couple Esther and Dayr Peterman bought and sold three $1 million-plus homes in three years through their agent, Jim Schultz, of Coldwell Banker in La Jolla, Calif. In addition to lowering his commission, Mr. Schultz has sent postcards to the couple while he is away on vacation, and dropped off freshly picked apples this October. "We went through about 10 brokers before Jim," says Mrs. Peterman. "He goes the extra mile."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers going the extra mile to make a sale, of course, are nothing new. But in the past, incentives such as rebates or discounted commissions were mostly to close the deal on the table at that moment. With the average American homeowner holding on to a property for six years, according to the NAR, many brokers weren't as focused on potential future business with the same customer. Now that some customers are flipping properties throughout the year, an extra incentive or nicety can cement an ongoing relationship, brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You've got everyone from bankers to college professors trying their hand at real estate," says Palm Beach, Fla., broker Rob Thomson. Because the rising market has made earning a profit relatively easy in some cases, those customers "keep coming back for more," Mr. Thompson says. When a repeat client goes on vacation, for instance, he or she is likely to return home to a freshly stocked refrigerator, courtesy of Mr. Thompson. It's paid off, he says -- repeat clients are now a mainstay of his business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some agents are dispensing with commissions in favor of flat rates and hourly fees. "Nearly 80% of our clients are repeat or referral customers," says Hal Feiger, a broker with Realty Advocates in Oakland, Calif. His firm offers an hourly rate of $120, as well as a $675 package that provides consulting services (setting up inspections, handling paperwork) for clients who don't need the full services of a broker. The company recently employed a flat rate of $2,200 on a $500,000 property sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clients targeted by these brokers are usually different than the traditional real-estate speculator. Those investors typically held on to multiple properties at one time. In such cases, a manager may be hired to keep track of properties and prospects. Brokers say they are now coming across more mainstream customers who look at this as a side project, not a primary source of income. "Today you have more consumers buying and selling multiple properties in order to cash in on quick profits," says Michael Ban, an analyst at UBS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of them is Kevin Roukous, a 37-year-old marketer for an event-planning firm. This summer, he made a $94,000 profit on a condo he sold for $400,000. He's since bought and sold two more properties. It helped that his broker lowered his commission on the sale a full two percentage points on the second and third transactions. A 4% commission, Mr. Roukous says, will "keep me coming back."</p>

  Real-estate brokers are increasingly catering to repeat clients, 
particularly the growing number of property investors and speculators. 
Below, some tips on buying to sell from real-estate brokers and lawyers. 
 
  The Agent: Get an agent who has experience handling investment properties. 
One approach is to look for one who is a Certified Commercial Investment 
Member. 
 
  The Property: Eager investors may be tempted to buy "anything" in a 
fast-moving market, says Washington, D.C., broker Joseph Himali. He says 
it's still about "location, location, location," and suggests investing in 
areas with good levels of appreciation. 
 
  The Contract: In an effort to stem the tide of speculators, some builders 
are instituting policies designed to curb "flipping," such as requiring 
investors to live in the home for more than a year before selling it. 
 
  The Tax Breaks: Mr. Himali suggests a tax advantage -- called a "Section 
1031 Tax Deferred Exchange" -- that allows investors to sell their property 
tax-free. The catch: The profit from the sale must be used to buy another 
real-estate investment the investor identifies within 60 days. But you can 
identify more than one property -- and have up to five years to actually 
complete the purchase.   </pre>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newest member of the international democratic leaders club, Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/122013/1/.htmltarget=_blank], recently had some words of encouragement and advice for the Iraqi people on their hard road to a better future: "They must go to polls. They must take this opportunity, elect their people to parliament, and have a government of their own, and have peace. . . . The major lesson in Afghanistan was that the Afghan people wanted change, from the tyranny of terrorism. The Iraqi people also will gain nothing if they allow these people to come from outside and destroy their lives."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We will know soon enough to what extent the Iraqis as a whole have listened to this advice, but as of six weeks before the vote, the indications are that the "silent majority" is keen for the election to mark a clean break from the past and a beginning of a new Iraq. It's not just in the political sphere that Iraqis, with the assistance of coalition forces, governments and organizations, are trying to make progress. In the economy, reconstruction, infrastructure, health and education, cultural life, and security, work continues every day, often under dangerous and difficult circumstances and just as often considered not newsworthy enough to compete with the insurgency and the growing pains of a country just starting to lift itself up after three decades under the boot of a bloodthirsty megalomaniac. Below are some of these stories of the past two weeks:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Society. The election campaign officially kicked off[http://www.heraldsun.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5478,11700109^1702,00.htmltarget=_blank] on Dec. 15, the day voter registration finished across Iraq. In the words of the current prime minister, Iyad Allawi[http://www.sierratimes.com/rss/newswire.php?article=/afp/20041215/wl_mideast_afp/iraqvote&amp;time=1103125919&amp;feed=iraqtarget=_blank], who announced his candidacy at the head of his Iraqi National Accord movement: "We strongly reject the injustice and separation of the past and we are working towards national unity." Allawi called the election a "precious dream."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraqis seem to agree. The latest poll[http://powerlineblog.com/archives/008929.phptarget=_blank] of 5,000 people in and around Baghdad suggests that an overwhelming majority are prepared to make a clean break with the past and pursue democracy--now. Some of the specific results:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What will you base your vote on?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Political agenda - 65%</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes - 83%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No - 13%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do not know - 4%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With just over a month to go, preparations for election day are accelerating[http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/world/10323570.htmtarget=_blank]: "At the offices of Iraq's election commission, workers scurry to field phone calls, greet sheiks and politicians, and prepare for the country's nationwide election Jan. 30. The pace borders on frenetic," says one report:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Registration of voters is under way. The registry is based on records of Iraqis who receive monthly food rations under a program that began in the early 1990s, when the nation was under U.N. sanctions. Today, rich and poor Iraqis alike still receive rations. "Nobody could tell lies to Saddam. So it was a correct record. Whoever lied was killed," said [Farid] Ayar, [the electoral commission spokesman]. Registration forms are delivered to citizens through food-ration agents linked to 542 distribution centers across the nation of 22 million to 27 million people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the totalitarian obsession with recordkeeping has made it easy to register votes within Iraq, the International Migration Organization will be trying to ensure through its Out-of-Country--Voting for Iraq[http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20041212-120355-9161r.htmtarget=_blank] program that Iraqis living in 14 foreign countries can also register over a one-week period a fortnight prior to the voting. As part of the overseas vote effort, Jordanian[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2004-12/14/content_2330556.htmtarget=_blank] authorities have announced they will set up a center to count ballots from the estimated 100,000 Iraqis residing in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, meanwhile, you can find the updated list of over 220 registered parties and independent candidates[http://fayrouz.blogspot.com/2004_11_01_fayrouz_archive.html#110047640554689021target=_blank] (entities) that will contest the election. The registered entities are, in turn, expected to field some 5,000 candidates[http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=12767&amp;Cr=iraq&amp;Cr1=target=_blank] running on 83 candidate lists[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_world/view/122481/1/.htmltarget=_blank]: "Nine of the lists were submitted by alliances of political parties, 47 by individual parties and 27 by independents."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the parties which will be participating in the poll is the Iraqi Islamic Party[http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data/focusoniraq/2004/December/focusoniraq_December119.xml§ion=focusoniraqtarget=_blank], the main Sunni party that until recently has been threatening to boycott the poll. You can also read this report about the aspirations of smaller parties[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-fg-candidate15dec15,0,5910036.story?coll=la-home-headlinestarget=_blank], which hope to capitalize on the public distrust of established politicians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is how the elections are expected to progress[http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/world/10395673.htm?1ctarget=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Campaigning begins . . . Wednesday [Dec. 15] and must end 48 hours before polling booths open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraq's election laws treat the entire country as a single constituency. A party or alliance will win seats in the National Assembly based on the percentage of votes its' list receives nationally. The system gives those candidates ranked high on the slate most chances to be voted in. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to electoral laws, at least one in every three candidates on a single list must be a woman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once all lists of candidates are submitted, the electoral commission will begin printing some 60 million ballots--in three different colors--for the 275-member National Assembly, the provincial councils and a national council for Kurdistan, Ayar said. The symbol of each political party or alliance will appear on the ballot along with the name of each group's leader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 9,000 polling stations, with up to five booths in each, are expected to open on election day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be eligible to vote, a person must be an Iraqi citizen, entitled to reclaim citizenship or eligible for citizenship. Voters are required to show an ID to prove they were registered on voter rolls that were based on a food rations database, created in the 1990s. Heads of families collecting the monthly rations have been asked to check the details of their households.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representatives of political parties, electoral commission staff and observers will monitor proceedings on election day. The commission has also invited the United Nations and several countries to send monitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In case violence proves particularly disruptive, the authorities are considering a proposal to extend voting[http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data/focusoniraq/2004/December/focusoniraq_December64.xml§ion=focusoniraqtarget=_blank] over a two- or three-week period in order to give everyone the maximum opportunity to vote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the campaign unfolds throughout Iraq, in Geneva a large team of workers continues to compile Iraq's new electoral roll[http://www.kurdmedia.com/news.asp?id=5892target=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A team of Arabic and Kurdish speakers in this Swiss city are racing to compile a register of voters for Iraq's elections by the end of December. . . . Manpower, a temporary employment agency [has been] contracted to help draw up the national register. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid escalating violence in Iraq, a huge exhibition centre in Geneva has become the unusual location for the compilation of the voter lists, which are vital to the success of the polls. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraq's electoral commission hired Manpower to recruit people with the right skills to correct names and dates in Arabic and Kurdish on a database of information about Iraqis who are eligible to vote. Despite safety concerns and difficulties in acquiring permits, the agency managed to hire enough staff and is now helping a group of companies oversee the compilation process in the exhibition centre, Palexpo. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 200 people hired by Manpower were Swiss, another 200 had permanent residency in the country and the rest had temporary permits. . . .

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The electoral lists are being drawn up on the basis of food ration cards distributed by the United Nations under Saddam Hussein's regime, when the World Food Programme oversaw distribution under the UN's oil-for-food programme. Iraqis started registering in about 600 offices around the country on November 1 and have six weeks to come forward to be included on the electoral register. The lists are then scanned and sent to Geneva where they are corrected and entered on computer. . . . They will then be returned to Iraq for use in polling booths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exact size of the Iraqi population and the number of voters is unknown. The last national census under Saddam Hussein's regime in 1997 said there were 23.8 million inhabitants in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other foreign assistance for the election continues to flow in. Canada[http://www.freep.com/news/statewire/sw108203_20041205.htmtarget=_blank] has offered to train election officials in Iraq and to help monitor the vote. Japan[http://www.japantoday.com/e/?content=news&amp;cat=9&amp;id=321898target=_blank] will be training 10 Iraqi electoral officials from Baghdad and Muthana province. Germany[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,1564,1420578,00.htmltarget=_blank], meanwhile, is assisting with electoral education:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new radio program is about to hit the airwaves in Iraq focusing on the upcoming elections scheduled for the end of January. It's radio for Iraqis, by Iraqis, with a little help from German organizations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even getting to this hotel conference room in Amman, Jordan was at times a life-threatening trek for some of the young Iraqi journalists. Those who came from southern or central Iraq had to make long detours around hotspots like Fallujah or Ramadi. Those from the north had to travel through Turkey and Syria to Jordan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they were willing to embark on the sometimes dangerous journey because they are all committed to one thing: making radio for their fellow Iraqis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this case, they'll be making Election Radio, a project funded by Germany's foreign ministry and coordinated by Deutsche Welle. Starting in mid December, the Iraqi journalists gathered in this hotel will be sending in reports from the ground daily to create a 30-minute program of current information over the upcoming vote in Iraq.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 19 journalists taking part in the project come from all 18 of Iraq's provinces. When they return, they will start producing radio packages and interviews that have been discussed with coordinators at Deutsche Welle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reporters will then send their finished pieces in MP3 digital format to Berlin, where they are turned into the half-hour moderated program in Deutsche Welle's studio. The completed program is then sent back to Iraq, again by MP3, to local partner stations where it is broadcast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Canada and Japan are training electoral officials, Denmark[http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/apmideast_story.asp?category=1107&amp;slug=Kuwait%20Iraqi%20Candidatestarget=_blank] is providing training for some of the candidates:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 100 candidates for Iraq's first popular election in decades traveled to Kuwait on Saturday for a seminar about the democratic process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The men and women were bused from the southern Iraqi city of Basra for the two-day event organized by Denmark's government. Two of the candidates are running for the national assembly, while the rest are candidates for local offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The candidates will attend lectures by experts from the United Nations and Denmark about Iraq's election law, the role of political parties, campaigning and how the vote will be conducted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Agency for International Development[http://www.usaid.gov/iraq/updates/dec04/iraq_fs08_121504.pdftarget=_blank], too, is contributing to training and capacity building in the run-up to the election (link in PDF):</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A USAID partner recently organized a conference on the electoral process for 46 participants from 27 parties. Representatives from the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq (IECI) gave a presentation on voting and individual and party registration procedures. The two-hour Q&amp;A period that followed the presentation provided answers to participants' questions on coalition-building, security concerns, governorate versus national registrations, election monitoring, IECI staffing, women candidates, out-of-country voters, ethnic balances in the city council, and numerous other technical issues relating to the election process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in another program:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first of three Iraqi election monitoring training academies was recently held in Amman. The five-day event brought together 26 Iraqi civic leaders from the Coalition of Non-Partisan Election Monitors for training on the specifics of Iraqi election law, best practices for monitoring, and how to develop and present a unified campaign statement. The academy also included special presentations from the United Nations on election preparations and regulations as well as a presentation from IFES on election violence mitigation. The final day included participatory mock exercises involving scenarios such as an error-plagued polling station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The participants of the conference are now responsible for recruiting and training an additional 100 monitors. The new monitors will work under the leadership of the Iraqi Election Information Network (EIN), which will serve as the domestic monitor coordinating umbrella. Using this train-the-trainer method, EIN hopes to train 5,000 to 8,000 Iraqi monitors for the January election.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While not surprisingly much attention has been recently given to training candidates and election officials, a seminar in the Czech Republic is aiming to help Iraqi judges[http://www.praguepost.com/P03/2004/Art/1209/news1.phptarget=_blank] rebuild the country's independent judicial system:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Iraqi judiciary is corrupt, inept and relies on barbaric methods to inflict violent punishments on those with the misfortune to enter its chambers. Wrong, very wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is one thing instructors at the second training seminar for Iraqi judges learned at the Central European and Eurasian Law Initiative (CEELI) in Prague, it's that Iraqi judges were well-prepared to resurrect a democratic legal system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When I met judges in Baghdad in 2003 and in Prague, they were much more sophisticated than I expected," said Judith Chirlin, a judge at the Los Angeles Superior Court whose most recent case involved rock star Rod Stewart's cancellation of a concert tour in South America.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chirlin was one of five international legal experts at a two-week training program for 50 judges that kicked off Nov. 26.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seminar is organized by the Sweden-based the International Legal Assistance Consortium (ILAC) with financial support from the Czech and British governments, and aims to provide Iraqi judges with additional education and support on topics such as human rights, DNA testing of evidence, ethics, media freedom, community outreach and court procedures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might remember from the previous installment[http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110005986target=_blank] the news about the establishment of Iraq's Commission for Public Integrity[http://www.washtimes.com/upi-breaking/20041215-021055-8617r.htmtarget=_blank], the official body set up to investigate and fight public corruption using a public hotline for tips. This is how one report describes the Commission working in practice:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a country where corruption has been part of the government culture for so long, it's tough to keep up with all of the complaints--up to 10 per day. Posters on the street now urge people to report financial abuse. Once callers knew they would be anonymous, the calls came in fast and furious. Investigators have already opened 121 cases based on tips from the hotline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One man looking at a poster said Iraqis are tired of the corruption, because they know it hurts them. "This may be new for Iraqis, but I hope it will succeed," said Abdul Karim Fakhri, 38, the manager of a supermarket. "We want someone to fight this corruption."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From politics to education, interest in computers and information technology is spreading among the young generation of Iraqis: "During Saddam Hussein's iron-fisted rule, owning a computer was theoretically allowed but remained the privilege of the elite and Saddam's cronies." Now in Baghdad, the Karrada Cultural Centre for Youth Computer Teaching[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_3-12-2004_pg4_8target=_blank] has opened in a villa which once belonged to one of Saddam's bodyguards. Safa el-Din al-Sultani, who runs the centre, "admits that the centre would have not been established without the help of the US military and explains that the idea of teaching children sprung to his mind following the fall of the former regime in April 2003":</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Americans welcomed the idea and they gave us 37 computers and ten play-stations," he recounts. "Iraq is considered to be an under-developed country. We have ignorance here and there are no centres to inform adults and youths about computers, which have become an essential element in our life," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 130 Iraqi boys and girls, aged 8-14, from 17 different schools in the Karrada area attend a two-hour computer course every day, delivered by fresh university graduates who volunteer to teach the children. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The children are eager to learn. They want to know how to use computers, how to play games and how to draw," says Mithal Alaa, 27, who studied at the Nationalist Computer Science Centre under the old regime. "We teach these children for free. Most of them come from families who cannot afford to have a computer in there homes," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraq's neighbors[http://www.iraqdirectory.com/files/articles/article276.htmtarget=_blank] are also trying to help the next generation reach their full potential:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shaikh Mohamed bin Issa Al Jaber, chairman of MBI International, signed an agreement with Taher Al Buka'a, Iraq's Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research, to support a post-graduate study programme for Iraqi students. Under the agreement MBI will fund 60 post-graduate scholarships for Iraqi students from next year. The students will complete their education in universities in the UK.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government of South Korea[http://www.menafn.com/qn_news_story_s.asp?storyid=72154target=_blank], meanwhile, has contributed $200,000 to the International Fund for Higher Education in Iraq, established by the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development (QF) and UNESCO with an initial donation of $15 million from Qatar:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the instability in Iraq, the [Foundation] Committee has made great progress and achieved many of the objectives, [QF chairman Abdullah al-Darwish] said. The Committee has provided opportunities for Iraqi faculty members to attend training programmes in European and Middle Eastern universities. Internet connection to Iraqi universities and supply of computers, science equipment and books are part of the agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Around 100 faculty members are currently undergoing training at various universities and the lab equipment and books are scheduled to be delivered in a fortnight," [director of the Fund, Bader Abdullah] al-Darwish said. The Committee chairman pointed out that Sheikha Mozah has provided seats to a group of gifted Iraqi students at the branch campuses of Weill Cornell Medical College and Texas A&amp;M University in QF's Education City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In media news, Iraq will be getting its first Arabic music FM station[http://www.iraqprocurement.com/docs/new581.htmtarget=_blank] when the United Arab Emirates-based Channel 4 Radio Network commences transmission at 98.8 FM. The company "will manage the operations of the radio station, which will initially cover a population of eight million within a 100 kilometre radius of Baghdad. In time, the promoters expect to cover the whole of Iraq."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another development[http://www.portaliraq.com/shownews.php?id=681target=_blank], "<span class="companylink">Telkonet, Inc</span>., working in commercial powerline communications (PLC), announced that it will support the execution of a U.S. State Department sponsored program to establish the Baghdad Media Center":</p>

Telkonet will work with several U.S. and Iraqi partners to implement a fully operational media center in the Iraqi capital dedicated to expanding civil programs, educational opportunities and training initiatives throughout Iraq.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Together with the growth of other freedoms in the new Iraq, Iraqi workers[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/120841/1/.htmltarget=_blank] are also discovering freedom of association:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraqi labour unions making their global debut at a conference in Japan are seeking tips on their tough task--how to make workers aware of rights suppressed for years by Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five trade union leaders from Iraq attended the 18th World Congress of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), which began on Sunday in the southwestern resort city of Miyazaki.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the first-ever appearance of Iraqi organised labour at a congress of ICFTU, which meets every four years. Saddam only allowed a government-run union and persecuted the underground labour movement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the collapse of the regime, at least 10 independent trade unions have been set up in Iraq.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An innovative program[http://www.iwpr.net/index.pl?archive/irq/irq_93_3_eng.txttarget=_blank] is attempting to kill two birds with one stone--help improve the traffic management in Baghdad and integrate the disabled into society:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a busy traffic junction in the Bayaa neighbourhood of the capital, Akram Alewi raises one hand to stop vehicles, while directing another stream of cars forward with the other, a whistle in his mouth ready to pull up offending motorists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may sound like an every day scene, but there is one slight difference: Alewi has been confined to a wheelchair since 1986 when he lost both legs, fighting in the Iran-Iraq war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The forty-year-old volunteer, one of a growing number, has been helping the municipality's traffic department since the end of the war in April 2003. "Before the fall of the regime I worked at the same junction, selling cigarettes to add to my disabled person's pension. I got just 27,000 dinars (18 US dollars) every three months and I have five kids, so it was never enough," said Alewi. "I started off helping out the young traffic policemen after the fall of Baghdad, when everything was chaotic. There were hardly any officers and even when they were there, people didn't take any notice of them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Karim Abas, the traffic officer in charge of this area of Baghdad, says he encourages his new band of volunteers, 'They do a good job organising the traffic, people seem to respect them.' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Economy. There is good news for Iraq's future within the international training regime, as the World Trade Organization[http://www.turkishpress.com/business/news.asp?id=041213181336.hev00vnc.xmltarget=_blank]'s 148 member states approve Baghdad's request to open membership negotiations:</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news and the bad news are the same in Iraq: America isn't leaving. A sign of how this resolve to stay the course is playing out in the minds of some Iraqis comes from the local real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Iraqi businessman was negotiating several months ago to sell a prime piece of commercial real estate in central Baghdad. He had tentatively agreed on a price with a Kuwaiti investor, who planned someday to build an electronics superstore on the 3,000-square-meter property. But after President George W. Bush was re-elected in November, the Iraqi jacked up the price by 25 percent. The prospect that a re-elected Bush administration would stay and fight--and ultimately stabilize Iraq--had instantly made his property more valuable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Basra[http://news.ft.com/cms/s/fa88333a-4f08-11d9-9488-00000e2511c8.htmltarget=_blank] and its surroundings, meanwhile, are hoping that the January election will provide a similar stimulus for a local revival:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraq's south produces about two-thirds of the country's oil, but is today its poorest region. Now some federalist-minded local officials are tying hopes for revival to their country's shakily unfolding democratic process. "We can develop Basra like Dubai or Hong Kong, that's what we want," says Abdul-Hafiz al-Atti, Basra's deputy governor. It would help if the city received a cut of Iraq's oil revenues. "Even 5 per cent is enough to compensate Basra for the last 35 years," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unemployment rate[http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20041204-061822-5610r.htmtarget=_blank] in Iraq fell from 28% at the end of 2003 to 26.8% during the first half of 2004. To help tackle this still unacceptable level of unemployment, a two-day conference sponsored at the Iraqi government's request by the International Labor Organization[http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=12783&amp;Cr=Iraq&amp;Cr1=target=_blank] "brought together more than 60 representatives of government, employers and workers in Iraq, as well as representatives of local authorities, civil society, UN agencies, the World Bank and international donors" who have been working on plans to reduce this economic and social problem.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a huge culture shift for most businesses in Iraq. We want to give owners and managers of woman-owned businesses an understanding of our processes and procedures so they will have an equal opportunity to bid on the various contracts for construction and services that we have available," said Shirley Wilson, deputy director of the contracting office for the Gulf Region Division of the Corps.</p>

This $225 million project was necessary in order to continue extraction from the field: "As the oil is extracted, the reservoir loses pressure. . . . To preserve the life of the reservoir, water is injected into the rock to replace the pressure created by the oil." The Missan province[http://www.azzaman.com/english/index.asp?fname=news\2004-12-9\10186.htmtarget=_blank], also in the south of the country, is planning some major energy developments:</p>

"We are preparing for the construction of a refinery and have submitted a feasibility study to the Ministry of Oil," Jaber, who leads Amara's business chambers, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jaber said the city entrepreneurs were also planning other projects "among them an electricity generation station." Amara is the capital of the Province of Missan where some of the richest undeveloped Iraqi oil fields are situated.</p>

"We have agreed on the gas project, which is expected to begin in October after infrastructure is rehabilitated and upgraded," Essa Al Oun, undersecretary at Kuwait's Energy Ministry said. The project will be divided into two phases, the first of which will supply Kuwait with 35 million cubic feet daily of Iraqi gas beginning October, followed by another 165 million cubic feet daily within the next two to three years, Oun said.</p>

For Micael Gulbenkian, Heritage's chairman and CEO, the new cooperative venture is like coming home:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of my family's centuries-old links to Iraq and the region, I have been able to visit Iraq regularly during the last two years. My great grandfather and great uncle were closely associated with the development of the Middle East oil industry. In fact, the Gulbenkian family was fundamentally involved with the establishment of Iraq Petroleum Company in the 1920s and the drilling of the first well in Kirkuk in 1927. My father for decades since the 1950s was associated with the development of the Iraqi Oil industry and, by investing in numerous social and development programs played a very important role in the fields of education, health, arts and science for the benefit of the Iraqi people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have been touched with the warm reception I have enjoyed within Iraq in general and the Autonomous Region of Kurdistan in particular.

The International Civil Aviation Organization designates Category I airports as those properly equipped to host international commercial flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On November 27 officials awarded a $10.3 million contract to construct a new air traffic control tower and install new runway lights and navigational aid equipment, all critical components that will help bring the airfield up to international standards.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The refurbishment of the rail track connecting Basrah with Umm Qasr port is 78 percent complete. 1,260 sleepers--the rail components used to reinforce the track--were recently delivered to the site and the mining, crushing and placing of foundation gravel is nearly done. In recent months USAID installed all 29 planned culverts and repaired ten railway gatehouses along the track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Track reconstruction is being complemented with training for Iraqi Republican Railway (IIR) staff. The final training plan was selected from competing proposals last week. By teaching IRR staff best practices in track construction and maintenance, USAID is supporting the sustainability of Iraqi rail restoration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upon completion of the project in January, 2005, the weight-bearing capacity of the rail line and train speeds will increase significantly. Iraq needs safe and effective transportation networks, and rail remains the least expensive way to move grain, fuel and other bulk cargo around the country. The railway was barely operational prior to the conflict, suffering frequent derailments, accidents, and delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Reconstruction. There is plenty of underreported good news about the Iraqi reconstruction effort[http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/local/10333727.htm?1ctarget=_blank] from USAID: "[Andrew Natsios, the administrator of USAID] said the United States has completed or is working on 7,000 assistance projects in Iraq, efforts that he said largely have been overlooked because of the focus on security problems. . . . While foreign news media tends to focus on the insurgency in Iraq, 'the more mundane work that we do in reconstruction is not covered as well, or as much or at all, in some cases,' [says Natsios]." Among the highlights of USAID's contribution to building the new Iraq:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Reconstruction of the port of Umm Qasr, which was essentially closed for more than 20 years. Now 50 ships offload there every month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Substantial overhauls of the power grid have produced an increase of more than 10 percent in megawattage compared with the prewar figure. "Right now, we have between 11 and 15 hours per day of electricity in almost all areas of the country that are electrified, and by the end of 2005 our expectation is we will be at 18 to 20 hours," [Natsios] said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Rehabilitation of nine sewage treatment plants is expected to lead to an increase of treated waste water by 250 million gallons per day by the first quarter of 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* More than 3 million children under the age of 5 have been immunized, and 700,000 pregnant women have been educated in neonatal care. In addition, high-protein biscuits and fortified milk have been distributed to more than 450,000 children and 200,000 pregnant and nursing mothers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Some 2,500 schools have been repaired as of March and 32,000 teachers trained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Natsios adds[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?c_id=2&amp;ObjectID=9001693target=_blank] that the U.S. had already spent $3.6 billion of $18.4 billion approved by Congress for reconstruction, and projects accounting for an additional $9.4 billion are in the planning stages or have already been approved. "Our work in Iraq is the largest reconstruction project since the Marshall Plan," he says. (Note that most current sources put the money already spent at only $2 billion.)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent speed-up in reconstruction work is in part due to a change in tactics[http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=7105735target=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States has shifted to smaller, low visibility projects from the high-profile, more expensive ones originally planned and the approach is paying off, said Charles Hess, head of the Project and Contracting Office in Baghdad. "We have taken all the smaller ones we planned and moved them to the front of the queue. We can get out there with these and have more impact," said Hess, whose office is in charge of much of the U.S.-funded reconstruction work in Iraq. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of Wednesday, Hess said, a daily average of about 100,000 Iraqis were employed on U.S.-funded projects and he expected this would peak to 140,000-150,000 by next summer. Dirt had been turned on 1,167 projects worth about $3 billion and 70 to 100 new ones were starting each week. Of the $18.4 billion, he said, $2 billion had been paid out and $9.6 billion legally contracted with companies to do work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From outside the United States, the World Bank[http://www.turkishpress.com/business/news.asp?id=041204164414.eoj8ib0j.xmltarget=_blank] has recently signed on a major reconstruction assistance deal:</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deals for a 65-million-dollar Baghdad water and sanitation project, 25 million dollars for emergency health and 55 million dollars for private sector development were signed in Amman in the presence of Baghdad Mayor Alaa Tamimi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">World Bank representative Joseph Saba said the grants were part of the 400 million dollar Iraq trust fund administered by the institution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next June 13-16, a series of exhibitions, workshops and seminars[http://www.ameinfo.com/news/Detailed/50699.htmltarget=_blank] is expected to provide networking opportunities for businesses and agencies participating in rebuilding Iraq:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Gateway to Iraq--Exhibition, Business and Investors Summit," a major event to support the reconstruction and economic development programme of Iraq, and to create awareness of the vast investment and trade potential in that country, will be launched in Dubai. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "Gateway to Iraq" Exhibition will bring together under one roof regional and international companies, offering a range of products and services related to the reconstruction effort in Iraq, and also any company looking to join the list of suppliers who will be supporting the lead contractors in Iraq.

Following the successful tendering process to redevelop the city of Najaf, foreign firms will also be welcome to submit their proposals in this latest round:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Ministry official Riyadh al-Wazir] said his department's plans included the drawing of new designs for most Iraqi cities. Most Iraqi cities lack modern sewage systems and suffer from chronic shortages of basic public amenities. Oil revenues in the 1970s and 1980s fuelled a reconstruction boom across the country but most of the development was haphazard and poorly planned. "We want to give each city its special Iraqi identity," Wazir said. Wazir said his engineers were drawing on experience collected by world organizations such as U.N.

In the Kirkuk[http://www.iraqdirectory.com/files/articles/article282.htmtarget=_blank] province several major projects have already been finished and several more are under way at a total cost of $8 billion. USAID, meanwhile, reports[http://www.usaid.gov/iraq/updates/dec04/iraq_fs08_121504.pdftarget=_blank] (link in PDF) that "the rehabilitation of a water treatment plant in northern Iraq that will provide clean water to 375,000 At' Tamim residents is 82 percent complete. The plant is more than 10 years old and suffered operational and structural problems before USAID's work began." In south-central Iraq:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">USAID will soon begin to expand and refurbish a faulty 30-year-old water treatment plant in Karbala that has long experienced structural failures. Before the existing facility is repaired, compact water treatment units will be installed nearby to allow continued water service while the rehabilitation is completed. The Karbala project is scheduled for completion in July 2005. Repairing this plant is particularly important because it supports millions of visitors and religious pilgrims each year. The spring pilgrimage to visit a shrine located near the treatment plant is part of religious life for many Iraqi Muslims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">USAID's Community Action Program "has developed 90 projects in 77 communities in Najaf governorate valued at $3.6 million":</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initiatives have directly benefited 865,769 Iraqis in addition to 654,403 indirect beneficiaries. Recent Najaf projects include the construction of a health clinic that will serve a combined population of 52,500. The area is located near a shrine that is frequented by many religious visitors each year. A local municipality will donate the land for the clinic, which will be equipped with triage services, a waiting room, an x-ray room, a laboratory, a dental office, and examination rooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Community Action Groups in Najaf have also developed projects to build maternity wards near existing health care centers. One $17,000 project will construct and equip a maternity ward with examination and recovery rooms and a pharmacy, serving 84,000 Iraqis. A second $50,000 maternity ward will serve 80,000 people in three communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A major plan to help the Iraqi health infrastructure[http://www.portaliraq.com/shownews.php?id=673target=_blank] is currently under way:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Iraq Project and Contracting Office (PCO) hopes to improve the healthcare situation in Iraq through its Buildings, Health, and Education Sector (BHE). The sector plans to renovate 19 hospitals and build 150 primary healthcare centers (PHCs) throughout Iraq by January 2006. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PHCs will be 15,000 to 21,500 square feet in size and will have physician clinics, dental offices, radiography departments, vaccination centers, labs, pharmacies and classrooms. Some of the PHCs will also include an urgent care center and a birthing center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The equipment provided will cover air conditioners to X-ray machines, patient beds, examination tables, microscopes, incubators, wheelchairs, scales, heart monitors, sterilizers, resuscitation units, defibrillators, pediatric blanket warmers, refrigerators, mammography units, water purifiers, ultrasound equipment, ventilators, stretchers, surgical instruments, dental chairs and dozens of other items.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the PCO will spend more than $700 million on healthcare-related construction and medical equipment in Iraq. This includes $225 million to construct PHCs; $149 million to renovate hospitals; $50 million to construct a pediatric hospital in Basra; $60 million for equipment for hospitals; $70 million for equipment for PHCs; and $165 million for training and general distribution of hospital equipment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Training 22 doctors in Ninewa, and 18 doctors and 36 nurses in Diyala'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Providing community outreach health services by establishing six mobile health teams that provided health services to 2,906 patients, provided antenatal care to 176 pregnant women, and vaccinated about 1,116 children and pregnant women in Diyala' Governorate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Rehabilitating a primary healthcare center in Mosul, which had been closed by the Ministry of Health due to lack of funding for rehabilitation. The center will be handed over to the Directorate of Health in Mosul and about 364 IDPs (52 IDP families) will benefit from its services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Undertaking a community outreach health promotion initiative using volunteer educators and reaching 3,049 returnee beneficiaries in Northern Iraq and 5,677 IDP beneficiaries in Diyala' Governorate. The NGO's strategy was to identify individuals among IDPs and host populations to provide them training and orient them on health promotion in their communities and villages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The NGO trained 20 community health volunteers in districts of Ninewa and Erbil, and 18 community health volunteers in Diyala'.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">USAID is also helping Iraqi farmers through its Agricultural Reconstruction and Development Program for Iraq. Recent activities[http://www.usaid.gov/iraq/updates/dec04/iraq_fs08_121504.pdftarget=_blank] (link in PDF) include helping the authorities build capacity to collect accurate agricultural data, conducting wheat-seed manipulation programs to increase yields, expanding farming tracks, and renovating a veterinary clinic.

Operation Iraqi Children[http://www.operationiraqichildren.org/target=_blank], a brainchild of actor Gary Sinise and Laura Hillenbrand, author of the book "Seabiscuit: An American Legend," has become one of the most successful humanitarian actions directed at Iraq. The idea of helping Iraq's next generation came to Sinise[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Dec2004/n12132004_2004121303.htmltarget=_blank] during an USO tour in Iraq in November 2003:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I went to this school, and I saw what it did for the troops to go out there and visit these kids and to see these smiling kids. . . . These soldiers had helped to rebuild the school. So when they showed up, the kids just ran out and threw their arms around the soldiers. And the troops are very protective of kids at the school. I just saw a lot of good will there that day, and I wanted to reinforce that in some way."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So he told the troops that he would gather and ship school supplies back to them so they could take them to the children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this endeavor to foster good will between U.S. troops and the Iraqi civilians, he and Hillenbrand started an OIC Web site. It was their way of showing people how they could help support the troops and the Iraqi children at the same time. And the response from the military and the public has been terrific. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American public has also embraced the organization. "We get stuff every week, every day from all over the country," [Sinise] said. "Now we're asking for blankets, which they need--(they) desperately need blankets over there. At night it's very, very cold."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sinise said donations of blankets, shoes and other winter items are being collected for shipment after the holidays because of the high volume of packages shipped at this time of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program wouldn't have become as big as it is without some help, Sinise said. That help comes in the forms of People to People International and the Veterans of Foreign Wars.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Iraq Project and Contracting Office (PCO) with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced . . . that the U.S. government has surpassed the 1,000 construction start mark one month ahead of their year-end goal. The reconstruction team has delivered 1,051 construction starts to-date. "We're thrilled to have achieved this goal in spite of insurgent activity," stated PCO Director Charles Hess. "At the same time, while it is an important mark, it's just a mark on the wall. There are going to be many more. As of today, we have 1,051 projects that have actually started construction, or 'turned dirt.' Our new goal is 1,200 by the end of the year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1,050 projects include schools (363), public health clinics (41), hospitals (14), railroad stations (58), border posts (88), port of entry (6), fire stations (20), police stations (17), military bases (16), water (67), electricity (58), oil (19), sewer (24), roads (66) and various others (194).</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraq's border-post project is one of the first steps to protecting the country from the influx of insurgents. Construction continues on the borders between Iraq and Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. More than 90 border posts are either under construction or complete. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Refurbishing police stations also remains a big focus of the reconstruction. . . . At least 27 stations and 10 vehicle checkpoints have been identified for refurbishment in a province in southern Iraq. Police cadet training has started on a military base in south central Iraq, and work continues on the many police stations in the southern district. Teams have started to assess the needs in different areas, and a direct funding apparatus has been put in place to enable rapid construction of the facilities. Five fire station sites have been identified, and 13 more are being assessed in both the Maysan and Basrah provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Troops continue to work to provide vital infrastructure throughout Iraq. Soldiers from Task Force First Battalion, 77th Armor recently renovated the Al-Ahabab water treatment plant[http://www.1id.army.mil/1ID/News/December/Article_06/Article_06.htmtarget=_blank] that provides water for 2,000 local people. The plant hasn't been operational for years. In Sheik Jamil village, near Balad, soldiers from the 13th Corps Support Command Special Troops Battalion have open a new water filtration plant[http://www.centcom.mil/CENTCOMNews/News_Release.asp?NewsRelease=20041211.txttarget=_blank] to serve 500 residents. In Gazaliya[http://www.portaliraq.com/shownews.php?id=679], a city of some 250,000 residents, the First Cavalry Division's 91st Engineer Battalion has so far spent $1 million on fixing the town's run-down sewer system. The effort also helps to stimulate the local economy: "One of the stipulations in all our projects is that 90% of all unskilled labor must be hired from the local area because we try to give jobs to as many people as we can," says Lt. Col. Chris Martin, the battalion's commander.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a valuable project involving paving a major section of Iraqi transport network[http://www4.army.mil/news/article.php?story=6648target=_blank] has been recently completed:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraq's first national highway running from its northern borders to the Persian Gulf in the south was completed Dec. 5 with the driving of a golden spike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Main Supply Route Tampa, also called Highway or Expressway One, was completed by a combined effort of coalition and Iraqi forces led by the 115th Engineer Group of the Utah National Guard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The golden spike ceremony was patterned after one in Utah 135 years ago when the world's first transcontinental railroad was joined in Promontory Point. The ceremonial driving of a golden spike completed the final link of the railroad on May 10, 1869, joining the U.S. Pacific and Atlantic coasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The golden spike ceremony for the Iraqi highway was performed by representatives of both Iraq and the coalition. Maj. Gen. Walter Natynczyk, deputy commander of the Multi-National Corps-Iraq, hammered the railroad spike into the center of the pavement with a representative of Iraq's Ministry of Housing and Construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report explains by way of background:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prior to the paving project, 143 kilometers of the 1,020-kilometer road were unpaved. The U.S. Army adopted the project in cooperation with Iraq in November 2003. Now, at least one lane of asphalt covers the center of Iraq from the northern borders of Turkey and Syria to the southern border of the Persian Gulf. The road construction had never been completed due to difficulties such as the war with Iran, the Gulf War, and issues Saddam had with people of the area, said the Iraqi ministry representative. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since there was no working asphalt plants to produce the materials needed for the road, Iraqis and Coalition Forces shipped bitumen, the naturally occurring tar used successfully for more than 6,000 years in the fertile crescent, and processed it and worked together to pave the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A considerable amount of humanitarian work in Iraq is done through Civil Affairs Battalions attached the U.S. forces.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Baquba[http://www.1id.army.mil/1ID/News/December/Article_36/Article_36.htmtarget=_blank], thanks to the teamwork between the local community and the 411th Civil Affairs Battalion publics works team, the local health clinic has been thoroughly renovated and is now operational.</p>

The Al Shebebea School in Owja[http://www.1id.army.mil/1ID/News/December/Article_31/Article_31.htmtarget=_blank] has been renovated, thanks to the efforts of Alpha Company, Task Force 1-18 Infantry. And Hazaban Primary School in Suleymaniyah[http://www.1id.army.mil/1ID/News/December/Article_28/Article_28.htmtarget=_blank] has received new kerosene heaters from the soldiers of the civil affairs unit of Task Force Danger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soldiers are also engaging in humanitarian work to bring immediately relief to people's lives. In the Shia section of Baghdad[http://www4.army.mil/ocpa/read.php?story_id_key=6633target=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every day since the Mahdi Militia turned in their weapons in October, there have been dramatic decreases of hostile activity in Sadr City allowing the Soldiers of Task Force Lancer to assist with re-building the neighborhood. Day in and day out, Task Force Lancer has been conducting missions such as: giving out sheep, frozen chickens and humanitarian-aid bags; protecting kerosene and propane stations and escorting sewage trucks to remove pools of sewage from the streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Says Staff Sgt. Chad Sandoe, 443rd Civil Affairs Battalion: "[Food items] are very well received. . . . We have no problems with giving them out, because we get large crowds when we arrive. Soldiers also get into it by passing out candy, toys and school supplies they receive from donations back home to the kids. The big thing about it is that since hostilities have subsided, we are trying to give something that makes an immediate impact on the people. The major projects we are undertaking are not as visible and take time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also in Sadr City[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Dec2004/n12082004_2004120802.htmltarget=_blank], soldiers from the First Cavalry Division's First Brigade Combat Team "teamed up with local children and cleaned a trash-covered area in the middle of an eastern Baghdad neighborhood, converting the land into a park. Infrequent visits from the city's trash trucks and no trash bins for people to use had resulted in what was turning into a trash dump, threatening the health of those living nearby":</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeing U.S. vehicles entering the area, local children ran to meet the soldiers and ask for candy, which soldiers often bring for them. This time, however, the soldiers distributed tools that the children could use to help in the cleanup. "Kids always approach us and want candy, but this time we had something for them to do. We wanted to encourage the local children to help themselves by using the rakes and shovels we provided to help clean up," [First Lt. Gerald] Kubicek said. "Since there were a lot of kids out there, we gave school supplies as a token of our appreciation after the work was done."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kubicek said getting the neighborhood energized was essential to the success of the project. "We tried to draw the community together by getting different families to help us with this project," he said. Since trash disposal had been the problem that made the field unusable in the first place, a trash pit was constructed so families have a centralized place for refuse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The following day, a local contractor delivered two swing sets and other playground equipment, giving local kids a place to hang out and play soccer, the Iraqi national pastime. "Now we have a nice, open park, two swing sets, and a place for them to deposit their garbage, instead of having it laying all over the place," Kubicek said. "We have a vested interest in giving something back to the Iraqi people. Projects like this one are a reminder that the American people are here to help."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's not all big projects and mass actions, as individual soldiers keep helping individual Iraqis. These are people like Doug Stenberg[http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041213/REPOSITORY/412130305/1031target=_blank], a staff sergeant with the 744th Transportation Company, a Hillsboro, N.H., resident who never took no for an answer in his attempts to obtain proper medical attention to 9-year-old Zaharra, who suffered from a cleft palate and a tumor on her upper jaw. Stenberg's persistence finally paid off after his superiors agreed for military doctors to perform free an operation that would cost Zaharra's family $1,000. Stenberg is not alone:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a similar story last month, soldiers from the 197th Field Artillery Brigade, headquartered in Manchester, helped 14-year-old Lamia Kareem, an Iraqi citizen, get the surgery she needed to have a tumor removed from the side of her liver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another, Stephanie Riley, of Penacook, a chief nurse and major with the 157th Air Refueling Wing of the New Hampshire Air National Guard, spent extra time caring for a toddler who Marines found abandoned and injured in a field in Fallujah. Her husband, Shawn, volunteered to adopt the child but said the couple later found out "it just would be a near impossibility" because there is no government structure in Iraq through which they could do it legally. Stephanie Riley helped transport the little girl to Germany for care. "She was the sweetest little thing that just liked to be held, not afraid of anyone," she said in an e-mail to friends and family. "One of the many heartbreaking stories that has come out of the war."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other coalition partners are continuing their humanitarian and reconstruction work throughout Iraq.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Japanese Cabinet[http://www.portaliraq.com/shownews.php?id=675target=_blank] has made the decision to continue the activities of the Self Defense Forces (SDF) centering on humanitarian and reconstruction assistance by revising the Basic Plan on the measures based on the Special Measures Law on Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance in Iraq. Activities of the SDF such as water supply, medical services, as well as rehabilitation and maintenance of schools and other public facilities, have restored and enhanced the basic infrastructure for the life of local residents and also contributed to their job creation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Japanese forces are based in the Al Samawah region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Diplomacy and security. Turkey and Iraq are increasing cooperation[http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?ID=34589target=_blank] to deny a northern Iraq sanctuary to Kurdish rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a terrorist organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While everyone's attention continues to focus on the Sunni Triangle, the rest of Iraq is full of dogs that didn't bark. Kirkuk[http://www.kurdishmedia.com/news.asp?id=5922target=_blank] is one of them:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the government of Saddam Hussein fell after the U.S.-led invasion in March 2003, Kirkuk was predicted to be ground zero in an Iraqi civil war. Nearly equal parts Arab Muslim, Kurd and Turkmen, with a number of Iraqi Christians as well, the groups were expected to clash viciously for power, prestige and wealth, setting the stage for a battle that could quickly spread nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But instead, even as violence and insurgency rages all around it, Kirkuk has defied the odds, becoming one of the most peaceful cities in Iraq. Its economy is growing; its police force is considered a model for the rest of the nation; its City Council meetings are lively and attended by the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Read how it all happened and the role U.S. troops are playing in the city:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike in most Iraqi cities, where soldiers live on outlying posts and enter city limits predominantly for patrols, several hundred troops in Kirkuk live in "safe houses" in the city center. Neighborhood kids swim in their pool; the soldiers send their local interpreters to pick up food from restaurants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bravo Company of the 1st Battalion of the 21st Infantry Regiment is one such example. The soldiers live in a sprawling compound in eastern Kirkuk. In nearly a year of living there, they have not taken a single mortar round or attack from a rocket-propelled grenade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The soldiers know their quadrant of the city as well as any local. Every day they visit schools, talk with religious leaders, visit clinics to check that medical supplies are coming in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout the country, Iraq's own new security forces are playing an increasingly prominent role in maintaining order and fighting the insurgents and terrorists. Foreign assistance in training and equipping continues to be essential for the development of these domestic forces. During his recent visit to Iraq, NATO's Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer has officially opened the NATO headquarters in Baghdad[http://www.iraq.net/displayarticle6044.htmltarget=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several hundred instructors due in the country will be protected by a NATO force, with the aim of training 1,000 Iraqi officers a year. NATO agreed to send a military training mission to Iraq in principle in June, but struggled for several months to agree the details. It is now rushing to deploy up to 400 instructors in the country ahead of the crucial elections. Lindqvist said NATO at present had 20 instructors in the country and the rest were being trained for the job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Forward Operating Base Paliwoda, Capt. Christian Cosner reports on the progress of the training of the 203rd Iraqi National Guard Battalion[http://www.1id.army.mil/1ID/News/December/Article_18/Article_18.htmtarget=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three companies we're responsible for had just graduated basic training when we first got here and since then, they've become a lot more competent at conducting their missions. . . . They've made our presence here much easier in that they're able to go into the cities and converse with populace because they identify with the ING. . . . They know the people and can gain their trust, which is a great way of gathering intelligence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Training of Iraqi police continues, too. Sixty-six officers[http://www.centcom.mil/CENTCOMNews/News_Release.asp?NewsRelease=20041203.txttarget=_blank] graduated from special courses ran at the Adnan Training Facility, in the International Zone. "Officers spent two to three weeks negotiating the specialty skill courses intended to augment the standard eight-week police training all officers undergo prior to service and three-week integration training for prior service officers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another 140 officers[http://www.centcom.mil/CENTCOMNews/News_Release.asp?NewsRelease=20041219.txttarget=_blank] graduated from the same facility more recently. And 914 officers[http://www.centcom.mil/CENTCOMNews/News_Release.asp?NewsRelease=20041220.txttarget=_blank]--including 52 women--graduated from Basic Police Training Courses at the Baghdad Public Safety Academy. In other police training news, FATS Inc.[http://www.portaliraq.com/shownews.php?id=660target=_blank] has been awarded a contract to provide high-level training to Iraqi police involving advanced firearm simulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraqi authorities have asked Australia to extend its training of police and military personnel to also cover intelligence and security services[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-12/06/content_397667.htmtarget=_blank]. According to Australia's defense minister, Sen. Robert Hill, "[Security] Minister [Qassim] Da'ud wants to train a group of new young leaders, possibly within Australia, in the field of intelligence and security, in order to subject them to alternative cultures and a new way of law enforcement that is different to the brutal techniques used by the Saddam Hussein regime. . . . Minister Da'ud said one of Iraq's big challenges was to develop a new psychology within the intelligence and security units after three decades of dictatorship."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australia is also considering providing additional resources for training of Iraqi security forces. These will take the form of a 50-strong defense team[http://www.theage.com.au/news/Iraq/More-Australian-trainers-for-Iraq/2004/12/13/1102787017167.html?oneclick=truetarget=_blank] to help train supply and transport personnel in the new Iraqi armed forces:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hill said this marked a shift in the Australian Defence Force's training role in Iraq from combat-operations training to providing specialist logistics skills. Senator Hill said the new 3rd Australian Army Training Team Iraq would replace Australians who have been training members of the new Iraqi army and navy and who will be back in Australia by February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the equipping of the new Iraqi security forces continues. In November[http://www.portaliraq.com/shownews.php?id=668target=_blank], the rollout consisted of:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 2 million RPK/PKM machine gun rounds; 1.2 million 9mm pistol rounds; 2.8 million AK-47 rounds; 450,000 12 gauge shotgun rounds including 200,000 slug rounds; 999,000 5.6mm rounds; 48 shotguns; 1,000 various-make 9mm pistols; nearly 1,000 RPK and PKM machineguns; 1,120 smoke and riot grenades; roughly 1,900 9mm Glock pistols; 5,400 AK-47 assault rifles; 20 Walther pistols; 78 rocket propelled grenade launchers; 16,000 sets of body armor; more than 7,400 helmets including 150 riot helmets; 44 French-designed Panhard M3 armored personnel carriers; four T-55 Russian-designed heavy tanks; 18 multi-purposed armored vehicles; and four Comp Air 7SL light reconnaissance aircraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rollout also included nearly 200 vehicle and handheld radios; 150 night vision goggles; some 11,000 field jackets; 3,000 cold weather jackets; 2,200 mattresses and beds; 40,000 desert combat uniforms; 11,000 pairs of running shoes; 300 kneepads; 600 tactical vests; 1,000 holsters; 9,500 t-shirts; 1,200 binocular pairs; 1,000 handcuff sets; 20 blunt trauma suits; 1,450 compasses; 132 GPS positioning systems; 800 'MAG' lights; 750 whistles; 4,150 hats; 344 first aid kits; 2,000 canteens; 1,500 police shirts; 2,000 police uniforms; two 2-ton trucks; 14 ambulances; 10 Russian-made GAZ heavy transport trucks; 15 Chevy trucks; 20 Chevy Trailblazers; four dodge Durangos; and 52 Chevy Lumina police sedans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British Defense Ministry also announced a £3.6 million pounds ($7 million) assistance package[http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=3891822target=_blank], which will include "438 AK47 grenade launchers with 18,400 rounds of ammunition, 5,666 9mm pistols with 850,000 rounds, just under one million assorted blank rounds for training and radio equipment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To increase security along the main highway linking Baghdad with Amman, Jordan, four airplanes[http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20041202-064432-5935r.htmtarget=_blank] will be used for surveillance, giving the security forces eyes in the sky. On the ground[http://www.1id.army.mil/1ID/News/December/Article_14/Article_14.htmtarget=_blank], meanwhile, "in an effort to discourage insurgents from re-entering this former rebel stronghold, Soldiers from the 216th and 9th Engineer Battalions constructed three traffic control points around Ad Duluiyah in November."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terrorism, violence and insecurity continue to plague Iraq, and the pace of reconstruction and the economic reform try the patience of people who, having suffered so much, are starved for a better life. Yet among all this, there is good news coming out of Iraq. Soon the Iraqis will have the opportunity to elect their government and thus institutionalize the process of reform taking place over the past year and a half. A few among them want to turn back the clock to before March 2003, while others want to turn it back by hundreds of years, and they will stop at nothing to achieve their goal. Let us hope that the silent majority of Iraqis will in the end prevail.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Greg Hitt and Michael Schroeder </div><div>708 words</div><div>17 December 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. current-account deficit, the government's broadest measure of trade, widened slightly in the third quarter, swelled by demand for imported oil and petroleum products, as well as foreign goods, including autos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury Secretary John Snow, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, also sought to shift some of the blame to other countries, saying: "Higher growth rates on the part of our trading partners would help a great deal." He added,"We'd like to see them grow faster so we can sell more . . . of the things that Americans are good at producing to them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third-quarter current-account deficit of $164.70 billion equaled 5.7% of gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the nation's output of goods and services. In the second quarter, the deficit was $164.39 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there was some good news in the report. The current account measures the ebb and flow not only of goods and services, but of investment as well, and the report showed that foreign direct investment in the U.S. took a positive turn in the third quarter -- good news for future growth at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said net FDI flows swung sharply in the July-September period, as the U.S. attracted $9.59 billion more in direct investments than was sent abroad. In the second quarter, by comparison, U.S. direct investment abroad outstripped FDI in the U.S. by $22.68 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're back in the business of attracting global investment," said economist Dan Griswold of the Cato Institute, a libertarian-oriented think tank. "That's a very good thing for the U.S. economy. That shows confidence for the long run."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at High Frequency Economics Ltd., in Valhalla, N.Y., suggested the swing in investment -- the first net inflow since mid-2001 -- is just the beginning of a longer-term turnaround. He said the change is fueled by a brighter assessment by foreign investors of the U.S. economy, compared with Europe and Japan. "We now think everything is in place for a strong and sustained upswing in net direct-investment inflows," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department also reported that housing starts fell 13.1% last month, as bad weather stymied new construction in several areas of the country. Housing starts slid to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.8 million units in November, compared with an upwardly revised level of 2.0 million a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts played down the decline. "Despite the steep drop in start activity, housing fundamentals appear sound: new-home sales were near record levels in October, while mortgage applications for purchase, fueled by continued low mortgage rates, have remained red-hot," said Peter Kretzmer, senior economist at Bank of America Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low mortgage-lending rates, which averaged around 5.7% in November, have helped buoy the housing market. So far, the Federal Reserve's five short-term interest-rate increases haven't hurt the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, permits authorizing new construction fell only 1.5% in November to 2.0 million, and remain 3.5% above year-ago levels. But economists expect new housing activity to flatten in the quarters ahead as rates edge higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, seasonally adjusted initial jobless claims fell by 43,000 to a five-month low of 317,000 in the week that ended Dec. 11, the Labor Department said. The decline was the largest since the week of Dec. 8, 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week average, which smooths out weekly fluctuations, declined last week to 337,750 -- below the 350,000 benchmark that economists say indicates an improving labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More broadly, workers filing continuing claims for unemployment benefits fell by 50,000 to 2,737,000 in the week that ended Dec. 4, the latest week for which data are available. The unemployment rate for workers with unemployment insurance held steady at 2.2% in that week.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. personal savings rate fell to its second lowest level on record in October, a development that makes it harder for the U.S. to shrink its huge trade deficit -- a gap that is putting downward pressure on the dollar.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in savings came as personal consumption and income growth remained brisk, and other reports showed continued optimism among manufacturers and blue-chip companies for the months ahead.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Households saved 0.2% of their disposable income in October, down from 0.3% in September, the Commerce Department said yesterday. It was the lowest savings rate recorded since the U.S. government began compiling savings data in 1959, with the exception of October 2001 when statistical quirks related to the prior month's terrorist attacks produced a small negative savings rate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Matus, an economist at Lehman Brothers, said the savings rate implies someone with take-home pay of $40,000, or about 30,096 euros, a year is on average saving $1.50 a week.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest drop in savings came as consumer spending rose faster than income. Personal consumption rose 0.7% in October from September, an acceleration from September's 0.6% gain. Spending on nondurable goods jumped 1.5%, likely reflecting much higher prices for gasoline. Indeed, adjusted for inflation, consumer spending only rose 0.3% in October, a deceleration from September's 0.5% gain.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal income rose 0.6%, a pickup from a 0.2% gain in September when hurricanes disrupted workplaces and chopped pay checks. After taxes, disposable income also rose 0.6%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The falling household savings rate is making it more difficult for the U.S. to rein in its current-account deficit, the shortfall on all trade and investment income between the U.S. and the rest of the world. That gap is running at more than 5% of gross domestic product, meaning that for every $100 the U.S. earns as a nation, it spends about $105, with the difference borrowed from foreigners.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers primarily have blamed the large U.S. budget deficit for the gap, but the drop in the household savings rate also is a major factor.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing activity rose to 57.8 in November from 56.8 in October, suggesting growth in the factory sector accelerated. The index is based on a survey of several hundred factory purchasing managers. A reading above 50 suggests manufacturing activity is growing, and below 50 indicates it is contracting. The subindex of new orders, an indicator for factory activity in coming months, rose to 61.5 from 58.3, and the subindex of employment rose to 57.6 from 54.8, suggesting the recent revival in long-battered manufacturing payrolls will continue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said construction spending was unchanged in October from September. Residential construction fell 0.3%, private nonresidential construction rose 0.4%, and public construction increased 1.2%.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. consumers spent briskly in October, an encouraging sign that the final quarter of 2004 is getting off to a decent start. Incomes rose sharply.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported yesterday that consumer spending went up by 0.7% in October, up from a 0.6% rise in September and the best showing since July.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In manufacturing, U.S. factories continued to flex their muscles in November, as a private survey of manufacturers found that the sector booked its eighteenth-straight month of expansion as new orders increased and price pressures remained high.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management reported yesterday that its manufacturing business index rose to a reading of 57.8 from 56.8 in October. That result bucked economists' expectations that the index would idle at its October mark. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth in Americans' incomes -- the fuel for future spending -- jumped by 0.6% in October as employers added significantly to payrolls, according to the Commerce Department's consumer report. That compared with a 0.2% advance in September and marked the biggest increase since May.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest snapshot of consumers was better than economists were expecting. They were forecasting a 0.4% rise in consumer spending and a 0.5% increase in income growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumers were not deterred by higher oil prices and by consumer confidence numbers that keep on going lower," said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics. "I got to believe this gets the fourth quarter off on very solid footings."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spending and income figures are not adjusted for price changes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose by a more moderate -- but still healthy -- 0.3% in October.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve, wanting to make sure inflation doesn't become a problem for the economy, has boosted short-term interest rates four times this year. Economists expect another increase on Dec. 14.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An inflation gauge tied to the consumer spending and income report showed that inflation is picking up. Prices rose by 0.4% in October, up from a tiny 0.1% increase in September.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other economic news, construction spending was virtually unchanged in October from the previous month at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.01 trillion, a record. Analysts were expecting a 0.7% rise. The report suggested that construction activity, which has been seeing slower growth since July, still remains vibrant.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy grew at a solid 3.9% pace in the third quarter as consumers and businesses spent more freely. Some analysts believe growth in the current October to December quarter could slow a bit, while others believe it could be slightly stronger.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers' resiliency has amazed economists. Analysts said they'll be watching consumers closely to see the extent to which sinking consumer confidence, high energy prices and a job market still recovering from the 2001 recession affect their buying behavior.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending by consumers accounts for roughly two-thirds of all economic activity in the U.S. Thus their buying appetite is an important factor in determining the strength of economic growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday's report showed that consumer spending on big-ticket "durable" goods such as cars, rose by 0.2% in October, down from a sizable 1.2% gain in September.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on nondurable goods, such as food and clothing, jumped by 1.5% in October, compared with a 0.8% increase in the prior month. Spending on services rose 0.5% in October, up from a 0.4% gain. The figures are not adjusted for prices changes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bush administration credited the president's tax cuts with helping the economy rebound. But Democrats counter that the tax cuts mainly helped the wealthy and plunged the government's balance sheets deeper into the red.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With consumer spending outpacing income growth in October, the personal savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income -- dipped to 0.2%, from 0.3% in September. October's savings rate was the lowest in three years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the savings rate doesn't provide a complete picture of household finances because it doesn't capture gains realized from such things as higher real-estate values or from financial investments.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Simon </div><div>1536 words</div><div>30 November 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A GROWING NUMBER of Americans are buying real estate as an investment, driven by the combination of low interest rates, rising property values and tepid stock-market returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors accounted for 8% of mortgages used to purchase homes in the first eight months of this year, up from 7.5% in 2003 and 5.7% in 2000, according to an analysis prepared for The Wall Street Journal by LoanPerformance, a San Francisco-based firm that tracks the performance of 46 million mortgages monthly. It's the largest investor share since at least 1986, according to the firm. The number of mortgages used to buy investment property may actually be higher since those figures don't include loans taken out to buy second homes that are used by the owner but may also provide rental income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The demand for investment property is particularly apparent in rapidly appreciating markets, including Las Vegas, Arizona and parts of California, according to LoanPerformance. But it's evident in other markets as well: In Miami, speculators account for as much as 80% of the preconstruction purchases of luxury condominium units, according to Mark Zilbert, an associate with Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell Realtors. In one new South Beach condo building, ICON, roughly half of the apartments were bought by investors and then resold before the building's official opening this week, according to the developer, the Related Group of Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The steady upward appreciation of housing prices has provided a sharp contrast to the stock market's performance during recent years. Median home prices climbed 7.7% during the third quarter from a year earlier, with many coastal markets posting double-digit gains, according to the National Association of Realtors. For the five years ended Sept. 30, median home prices rose 39%, versus a loss of 13% for the Standard &amp;Poor's 500-stock index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those gains have attracted many individual investors. "It seems like investing in real estate is a wiser decision than putting [the money] into a stock market or savings account or savings bonds," says Kelly McDonnell, a recruiter for an educational testing company in Amherst, Mass. Ms. McDonnell is currently shopping for a two-family duplex she can rent out and then, she hopes, sell for a profit in a few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But investors betting on double-digit gains could end up disappointed. Falling interest rates have helped fuel the recent rise in home prices, but rates are more likely to rise than fall going forward. Already, there are signs that the housing market is cooling. The 7.7% increase in median home prices during the third quarter, while still above historical levels, represents a decline from the 8.9% annual gain posted in the second quarter, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One alternative: real-estate investment trusts, which buy and then rent out shopping malls, apartments, office buildings and other real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs give investors access to a diversified mix of properties and a hefty dividend without the management headaches. Already this year, investors have poured a record $5.17 billion into funds that invest in real estate, according to AMG Data Services in Arcata, Calif. The inflows, which cover the period through a week ago today, exceed the record $4.75 billion that poured into real-estate funds in all of 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though considered a relatively safe investment, REITs can also be volatile. REIT prices fell roughly 20% during a six-week period this spring after a strong jobs report raised fears that the Federal Reserve would be more aggressive about raising interest rates. That would have made yields on REITs less attractive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have since rebounded, but whether REITs can maintain their upward trajectory is a matter of debate. They currently trade at roughly 19 times adjusted funds from operations -- a commonly used measure of REIT earnings -- well above their historical average of 12 times adjusted FFO, according to Mike Kirby, a principal with Green Street Advisors, an independent REIT research firm. The average yield on a real-estate fund is now 2.8%, according to Morningstar Inc., down from about 4% three years ago. "On a pure valuation level, it's hard to make the case that real-estate funds are a good buy now," says Morningstar senior analyst Dan McNeela.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some analysts say that REITs remain attractive for investors with a long-term time horizon. Mr. Kirby expects REITs to generate long-term returns of 9% a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors interested in owning hard real-estate assets range from first-time speculators to wealthy individuals. Erik Friis, a San Diego attorney, started buying San Diego real estate in the late 1990s, then set his sights on Arizona as prices in California climbed. "It came to a point where there weren't any properties that made sense to buy," says Mr. Friis, who recently sold a small apartment building in San Diego and used the proceeds to buy a 24,000-square-foot shopping center in Tucson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Long Beach, Calif., there's "more of a demand than ever for investment property," says Richard Gaylord of Re/Max Real Estate Specialists. "The problem is that inventory is so low that I'm pulling my hair out trying to find them stuff."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many buyers are new to real-estate investing. In Tucson, "people who never looked at real estate as being part of their investment portfolio . . . are either acquiring residential income property or participating in partnerships," says Rosey Koberlein, president of Long Realty Co.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Warwick, R.I., broker Ron Phipps says many investors are opting for properties with good locations, even if a high purchase price means they won't cover their costs for the next few years, Mr. Phipps says. Others are buying investment properties that may eventually be used by a child or aging parent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate purchases are becoming increasingly popular among people with $1 million to $10 million in assets, says Kevin Ruth, a senior vice president and director of financial planning at UBS AG's UBS Financial Services unit. In the Wisconsin Dells resort area, condos that double as second homes and rental properties "are going like hotcakes," says Michael Dubis, a financial planner in Madison, Wis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in investment purchases has caught the attention of many who track the housing market, including Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. In a speech before America's Community Bankers in October, Mr. Greenspan noted that purchases of single-family homes for rental or use as second homes have grown in recent years, though he said they still accounted for less than 11% of total home-mortgage originations in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some housing experts worry that investor demand has helped fuel the recent gains in home prices and could accentuate any downturn as interest rates rise and demand slows. The country is experiencing "investor-driven price increases in certain markets. . . . And these markets could soften as investor demand wanes, as it inevitably does," Fannie Mae Chairman Franklin Raines said in a speech last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The perils of betting on short-term profits have been particularly apparent in Las Vegas, where speculators helped push prices up nearly 54% in the past year, the highest growth rate ever measured in a metropolitan area, according to the National Association of Realtors. When a falloff in sales and traffic led a handful of builders to cut prices this fall, the reductions "hit investors hardest," says Larry Murphy, president of SalesTraq, which tracks the Las Vegas real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owning real estate, meanwhile, isn't as simple as purchasing a stock or a bond. Investors need to be ready to handle late-night calls about broken water pipes and faulty heating systems -- or hire someone to manage these and other headaches. Management fees often run 5% to 10% of gross rents. Moreover, rising housing prices are, in many cases, making it tough for investors to cover expenses -- such as mortgage payments and property taxes -- through rental payments.</p>

  Thinking of investing in real estate? Keep these points in mind: 
 
  -- In many markets, rising prices have made it tougher to cover expenses. 
 
  -- You'll need a managing agent to handle repairs and other headaches, or do it 
yourself. 
 
  -- Local laws and rising taxes can add to costs.   </pre>

</div><div class="author">By Constance Mitchell Ford </div><div>751 words</div><div>26 November 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy entered the holiday-shopping season on a high note, as an improving job market, strong consumer sentiment and gains in home sales indicate that consumers are still willing and able to spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic conditions "look extremely good going into the Christmas season," says Susan Sterne, president of Economic Analysis Associates in Greenwich, Conn., which is forecasting a 7.5% rise in nonauto general merchandise sales in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier. "There is every reason to believe that holiday sales will be better than last year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like other economists, Ms. Sterne's optimism about the season was reinforced by a slew of economic data released Wednesday, some of which suggested that the economy is growing faster than previously projected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The University of Michigan's report on consumer sentiment for November, which is released only to subscribers, was said by those who had seen it to have increased to a reading of 92.8 for the month. While that was lower than the preliminary reading for November that was released a few weeks ago, it's still higher than October's reading and a sign that sentiment improved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The sentiment reading was good, not great, but good," says David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities. He said the sentiment reading might have been higher had it not been for changing buying attitudes about autos, which he said were the least favorable in three years. That, says Mr. Resler, may indicate that spending is shifting away from big-ticket items toward smaller items, a trend that could help sales of general merchandise and apparel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists were also heartened by a Department of Labor report that showed new claims for unemployment insurance fell last week to 323,000, a three-month low. The four-week moving average of claims, which smooths out weekly fluctuations, dropped last week to 332,000, the lowest level since Nov. 18, 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Census Bureau reported that sales of new homes increased in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.23 million units, the third-highest level on record and a much stronger performance than economists had expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report on the industrial sector was more sobering, yet some economists found reasons to be optimistic. The Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods -- high-price manufactured products expected to last at least three years -- declined 0.4% in October. Factory activity was weighed down by weakness in new bookings placed for automobiles, computers, electrical equipment and primary metals, which include steel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the overall number was a disappointment, as many economists were expecting a moderate gain, components of the report were more upbeat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First of all, orders in September were revised to show a 0.9% gain, much stronger than the government previously estimated. And shipments of durable goods for October -- a good barometer of current demand -- rose 0.6%. According to economists at J.P. Morgan Chase, when excluding defense goods and aircraft, "core" durable goods shipments are up an annualized 20% over the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On balance, Wednesday's economic reports were "unambiguously good" said Ted Weisman, an economist at Morgan Stanley. Based on the latest data, Morgan Stanley revised up its fourth-quarter estimate of real gross domestic product -- the value of the nation's output, adjusted for inflation -- to an annualized growth rate of 4.4% from its previous estimate of 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morgan Stanley's estimate is much higher than the consensus forecast of economists surveyed earlier this month by The Wall Street Journal Online, which called for fourth-quarter GDP growth of 3.7%, the same as the pace of growth clocked in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Merrill Lynch raised its fourth-quarter estimate of GDP growth to 3.5% from 2.5%, but the firm's economists say they are sticking with a forecast for slower growth of 2.5% in the first quarter of 2005. In written comments to clients, David Rosenberg, Merrill's chief North American economist, said the forecast of slowing growth reflects "five consecutive down months on the leading economic indicator and the sharp slowing" of new orders for technology products.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Long-term fixed home-mortgage rates were flat to a bit lower this week, while Treasury-indexed adjustable-rate mortgages rose slightly, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the housing-finance agency, said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages for the week ended Wednesday fell to 5.72% from 5.74% a week earlier. A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was at 5.83%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages this week was 5.15%, unchanged from one week ago and down from 5.17% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate for one-year Treasury-indexed adjustable-rate mortgages rose to 4.27% from last week's average of 4.17%, and a year-earlier 3.72%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At this time last year, our forecast called for interest rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages to exceed 6% by this time this year," said Frank Nothaft, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> vice president and chief economist. "Today's annual mortgage rates are below even that projection thanks to the spring `soft patch' in economic growth. Nevertheless, our outlook is that long-term rates are destined to rise to a still home-buyer friendly range that will most likely cause home sales to cool relative to their current record highs," he said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of previously owned homes eased in October but still clocked in at the fourth-highest pace on record, a fresh sign that the housing market is in solid shape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.75 million units in October, a 0.1% decline from September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the decline, analysts say home sales remain on course to set a record for 2004, aided by low mortgage rates. "The ongoing stimulus of lower-than-expected mortgage interest rates was the primary driver of strong home sales in October," said David Lereah, the association's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the Federal Reserve has been pushing short-term interest rates higher, mortgage rates have actually drifted lower in recent months. The average monthly rate on a 30-year mortgage in October was 5.72%. That was down from 5.75% in September and considerably below 5.95% in October 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists say an improving employment climate also is helping to underpin home sales. In October, the economy added a sizable 337,000 jobs, the most since March. If payroll gains are sustained going forward, says Mr. Lereah, that also should help support the housing market in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a previously owned home was $187,000 in October, up 8.8% from the same month last year. The median is the midpoint price; half of all homes sell for more than the median and half sell for less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday's report showed some sharp differences by region. Sales fell in all parts of the country except the South, where they rose by 3.7% in October from September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.77 million. In the Northeast, sales dropped 1.3% to a rate of 750,000. In the Midwest, sales clocked in at a rate of 1.37 million, a 2.8% decline from September. Sales in the West fell 3.6% to a rate of 1.86 million. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing homes in the U.S. declined slightly in October but exceeded analysts' projections, indicating that the market remains healthy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said that home resales fell to a 6.75 million annual rate last month, a 0.1% decline from September's revised 6.76 million annual pace.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, the association's chief economist, said, "The ongoing stimulus of lower-than-expected mortgage interest rates was the primary driver of strong home sales in October." He noted that "other market fundamentals remain sound, so we should only see a modest decline from record home sales this year if mortgage interest rates gradually rise."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The level of resales in October was above Wall Street expectations. Analysts predicted existing home sales would drop 0.7% to a 6.70 million rate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of homes on the market fell to 4.3 months in October, compared with September's revised 4.2 months, the association said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Today's Market Forecast]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House of Cards?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists see a slowdown in housing as a "when," not an "if." But the "when" keeps getting pushed further into the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's report on existing-home sales from the National Association of Realtors looks likely to show another month of strength. Economists expect that October existing-home sales -- which might otherwise be termed "used-home sales" -- came in at an annualized clip of 6.7 million. That is 4.5% above the year-ago level and not far off of September's 6.75 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hang the spry housing market on mortgage rates, which most people reckoned would rise through the course of the year but instead are slightly lower than they were at 2004's outset, according to Freddie Mac. Falling interest rates and an attendant rising rate of home ownership have been the main factors behind the housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some chinks have appeared lately in the housing market's armor. Some hot markets like Southern California and, especially, Las Vegas have cooled and prices in general appear to have moderated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the Federal Reserve appears set to raise its target federal-funds interest rate by another quarter point when it next meets in December, and recent comments from Fed officials suggest they expect to continue raising rates through much of next year. That would probably push long-term Treasury yields up, as well, leading to higher mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With U.S. household debt levels near all-time highs, by any common measure, a rise in rates could damp consumer spending, points out Merrill Lynch economist Jose Rasco. First, a greater share of household income would need to be earmarked toward debt financing. Second, if the rise in rates also made home prices falter, it would mean that the asset that households had used as collateral had fallen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Merrill's strategy group has pointed out that just as an investor who uses leverage to buy a stock will see outsized gains or losses, someone who has, say, made a down payment of only $10,000 on a $100,000 home may be more affected by price swings than someone who has put down $50,000 on an identical home. If the homes' value fell to $90,000 and they both sell, the first will have lost all the money he put down, while the second will have seen a loss of just 20%. Even if the first buyer hangs onto his home, his spending behavior might be affected.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Inflation Perks Up as the Fed Weighs Pace of Rate Increases</span>
</div><div class="author">By Jon E. Hilsenrath </div><div>769 words</div><div>18 November 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer-price inflation picked up in October, a development that is likely to get the attention of Federal Reserve policy makers as they weigh whether to alter the pace of increases in short-term interest rates during the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department reported yesterday that its consumer-price index rose 0.6% in October on a seasonally adjusted basis from the month before, the largest increase in five months. Rising energy and food prices drove the increase, but other goods and services played a role. Medical-care prices accelerated after slowing earlier in the year and apparel prices rose for the first time since June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding food and energy, consumer prices were up 0.2% from the month before, which is faster than the pace of increases between June and August, though down slightly from September. The report, taken together with large increases in producer prices reported earlier in the week, suggested the country's inflation rate, while still low, might have perked up after a lull between June and September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of these trends could reverse. Crude-oil prices have receded in recent weeks and there are signs that food-price increases have tapered off. Moreover, apparel prices could recede next year as textile import quotas are removed. But the aftereffects of price increases already seen still are reverberating through some segments of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Samantha's Finefoods-Catering, an Italian delicatessen in lower Manhattan, food- and energy-price increases are pinching. Co-owner Dominick Liuzzi says delivery trucks for the past year have been demanding $3 to $4 surcharges to compensate for costlier gasoline. Prices for green peppers, tomatoes and high-end provolone cheese have moved higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You'll probably see an increase in the [price of] heroes," Mr. Liuzzi says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While inflation perked up, other reports pointed to plenty of momentum in the underlying economy. Industrial production rose 0.7% last month, after a 0.1% increase in September, the Fed said. Housing starts increased 6.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about two million units, the fastest pace of new construction since December 2003, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial output and housing construction probably were nudged higher by the resumption of activity following hurricanes in the South. Nevertheless, economists said the reports sounded a common theme.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The economy is showing a lot of resilience in the face of higher energy prices," said David Greenlaw, an economist with Morgan Stanley. This leaves the Fed "the ammunition to keep moving" short-term interest rates higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the Fed raised the target for the federal funds rate -- charged on overnight loans between banks -- to 2% from 1.75%, the fourth increase this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minutes of the Fed's Sept. 21 policy meeting showed policy makers were open to slowing the pace of rate increases if they spotted signs of anemic economic growth or low inflation. In comments this week, Fed officials have voiced little concern about inflation. At the same time, they have given little indication they are prepared to alter the gradual pace of rate increases just yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Sandra Pianalto said yesterday that oil-price gains haven't had a major inflationary impact, while other Fed officials have spoken pointedly about more rate increases. "Our work is not done," Fed Governor Mark Olson said Monday. On Tuesday, Michael Moskow, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, echoed that sentiment, saying "there is certainly more ground to cover" to shift interest rates to a less stimulative level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the data this month are pointing to sustained expansion. As a result, the financial futures markets are pricing in a high likelihood that the Fed will move the federal-funds rate to 2.25% in December and 2.5% in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its report yesterday, the Labor Department said consumer prices were up 3.2% in the 12 months through October, up from a 2.5% rate in the 12 months through September. The core consumer-price index was up 2% in the 12 months through October, the same as in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy prices rose 4.2% in October alone from the month before, the largest monthly increase since May. However, recent declines in crude-petroleum prices suggest this index could see downward pressure in November.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Raymund Flandez </div><div>701 words</div><div>18 November 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time home buyers have played an important role in keeping the housing boom going, according to a recent report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases by first-time buyers accounted for four out of 10 home purchases, and were a major driving force of the year's housing-market surge, a study released early this month by the National Association of Realtors found. The dollars pouring into the market by first-time buyers also helped homes sales by providing existing homeowners the capital to buy new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coupled with historic lows in interest rates and an improving economy, existing-home sales are expected to shoot up to a record high of 6.55 million this year, up 7.4% from 6.1 million in 2003, the Realtors association says. The group predicts existing-home sales will hold steady around six-million-plus for the next couple of years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time home buyers accounted for 3.23 million home-sale transactions overall, including new and existing family homes and existing condos. They purchased more single-family homes, about 3.09 million, up 7.4% from 2.87 million last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's all due to entry-level buyers," says Walt Molony, an National Association of Realtors spokesman. "Without the liquidity that first-time buyers are providing to the marketplace, we wouldn't be having record sales." The study, which was based on a national sample of more than 8,000 recent home buyers, is the latest in a series of annual surveys by the Realtors association evaluating the demographics and other aspects of the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend is expected to continue in the next decade as children of baby boomers age into their prime years for buying a home. These "echo-boomers," as well as minorities and immigrants, make up an increasingly bigger part of the pool of new home buyers, and are expected to keep the real-estate sales bustling as they become "tomorrow's repeat buyers," the study says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact of baby boomers on the housing market was most evident in the late-1970s, when they became first-time buyers themselves. In 1978, the baby-boom generation took home sales to a record-breaking 3.98 million. The housing market didn't take off again until the mid-90s, when 4.02 million existing homes changed hands in 1996. The housing market then was buoyed from declining interest rates that increased consumer-buying power. Home sales have set records each year since then, aside from a brief dip in 2000 because of a recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report found that the average first-time buyer is 32 years old and has a household income of $54,500. In contrast, a repeat buyer is 45 years old with a household income of $79,100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the survey, the majority of first-time home buyers are white, while one in 10 is black, although the data may be skewed because many of those surveyed declined to describe their race. First-time buyers also are somewhat more likely to speak a language other than English compared with repeat buyers, "reflecting a higher share of recent immigrants among first-time buyers," the study says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the types of homes they buy, first-timers are more likely to buy townhouses or row houses in urban areas than the detached single-family homes in suburban areas preferred by repeat buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, first-time home buyers have more options in financing their homes than 20 years ago. And with expectations of rising incomes over time, these buyers are making good use of financing plans. The study says first-time home buyers financed a median of 97% of the purchase price, with 42% reported financing the entire purchase price of the home. Meanwhile, repeaters, who often have equity in their previous home, financed a median of only 78% of the purchase price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors estimates that the interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage will stay under 6% for the rest of this year and will average 6.5% next year. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. Federal Reserve officials have signaled they would be taking a very close look at incoming economic data before deciding how aggressively to raise short-term interest rates in the months ahead. Well, the data are coming in, and they suggest the modest pace of rate increases will continue for now.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department reported yesterday that its consumer-price index -- a closely watched gauge of inflation -- rose by a larger-than-expected 0.6% in October, the largest increase in five months.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While inflation was perking up after a lull in the past few months, other reports suggested the underlying economy carried plenty of momentum going into the fourth quarter, with industrial production and housing construction both rising. Industrial production grew 0.7% last month after a 0.1% increase in September and a 0.1% decline in August. Housing starts last month increased 6.4% to a seasonally adjusted 2,027,000 annual rate, the highest level since December 2003, the Commerce Department said.  </p>

But the core consumer-price index -- which excludes volatile food and energy prices -- showed no acceleration in the growth of prices. It was up 2% in the 12 months through October, the same as in September. It rose 0.2% from the month before on a seasonally adjusted basis.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy prices rose 4.2% in October, the largest increase since May. Gasoline prices registered an 8.6% increase, while fuel-oil prices rose 9.4%, both the biggest increases in 20 months. However, the recent fall in crude petroleum prices suggests these indexes could see downward pressure in November.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Food prices also surged in October, climbing 0.6%, the biggest increase since May. Prices of fresh fruits rose 6.3%, the biggest increase in more than 20 years. Prices of fresh vegetables rose 8.8%, the biggest increase since early 1997. Patrick Jackman, a Labor Department economist, said some of those increases were "associated with the hurricanes in Florida."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraq's free press[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2004/10/d7a3c71a-e5a3-4bf9-a263-9a4fcc8908a6.htmltarget=_blank] has certainly been making it difficult for everyone to overlook the coming of democracy:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newspapers in Iraq have been offering up a barrage of daily reports and opinion pieces over the past month on a variety of election-related subjects. Politicians and religious leaders "in the know" have commented on election developments, as the official Electoral Commission has detailed information on the mechanisms established to become a candidate and on voting. Articles have appeared on voter-education seminars that are being offered by political parties and organizations; the likelihood of whether or not expatriates will be allowed to vote from abroad, whether Sunnis will participate in the elections, as well as the political maneuverings as the parties work to forge alliances and place their candidates on election lists that will meet the stringent requirements established by the commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But perhaps the most salient barometer of the "mood" in Iraq can be found on the editorial pages of Iraq's dailies. Commentaries overwhelmingly support the elections and offer intelligent and well-constructed viewpoints on a variety of election-related topics. Writers regularly demand that the Electoral Commission provide more information on the election process, and call on the Iraqi people to cast their ballots on election day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Writers publishing in a variety of newspapers supporting divergent political positions appear to agree on one fact: elections should not be derailed by terrorism and instability. Most contributors have stressed the necessity of holding nationwide polling. But some writers support the idea that partial elections in stable areas would be better than no elections. "Attaining half or three-quarters of legitimacy, so to speak, is better than no legitimacy at all in order to respond to the doubters and silence the loud voices that keep accusing the government of treason and illegitimacy. They act as if the whole Arab world enjoys legitimacy and as if Iraq is the only exception in the region that has no legitimacy in the middle of [an] ocean of Arab legitimacy," Latif al-Subayhawi wrote in the 18 October edition of "Al-Dustur."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report notes that "news of Iraq's upcoming January elections has dominated the pages of Iraq's major dailies in recent weeks, to some extent crowding out the more detailed coverage of the growing insurgency, the presence of multinational forces, and even the workings of the interim administration." Which arguably demonstrates that the Iraqis are fully aware of how crucial the elections are to the future of their country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newspapers may be doing their best, but clearly there is no such thing as too much civic education in a country that had suffered under a brutal dictatorship for some three decades. The Wall Street Journal's Daniel Henninger reports on the latest cooperative initiative between the Spirit of America and enthusiastic Iraqis. The project, Friends of Democracy[http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/dhenninger/?id=110005794target=_blank], aims "to educate the Iraqi people about the meaning and purpose of democracy before that January election date." Read the whole story and see if you can assist this very valuable project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the democratic steamroller gaining speed, even  United Nations officials[http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=187984target=_blank] in Baghdad are increasingly optimistic:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preparations for the crucial January election are "on track" and the absence of international observers due to the country's tenuous security should not detract from the vote's credibility, the top U.N. electoral expert here said. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"International observation is important only in that it's symbolic," Carlos Valenzuela told The Associated Press. . . . "I don't think that the process will be less credible without observers, absolutely not. They are not the essence. They are not essential. They are not important. If they can come, fine, of course."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Valenzuela, preparations on the local level are progressing according to plan: "Already . . . about 15 U.N. electoral officers were based in Amman, in neighboring Jordan, and that four experts from the International Foundation for Election Systems, a Washington-based organization, were working in Baghdad. Valenzuela said the electoral commission already has hired 400 electoral officers, of whom more than 300 were stationed outside Baghdad. Close to 6,000 Iraqis were undergoing training to be clerks at 548 voter registration centers across Iraq."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Britain's Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, the following timetable[http://www.voanews.com/english/2004-10-28-voa58.cfmtarget=_blank] is in place in the run up to the election: "Registration will begin [in November] for voters, parties and candidates. . . . Iraqis will be informed of their status on the electoral rolls when they receive their food ration coupons beginning next week. . . . Voters will have until December 15th to straighten out any irregularities. . . . During the same time period, parties and candidates will register for the election." According to Iraqi Electoral Commission, while no exact date has been set yet, the election is scheduled to take place in the last week of January[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/world/iraq/20041103-0807-iraq-election.htmltarget=_blank].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The process is already under way[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=9662target=_blank]: "Adverts splashed across the front or back page of many Iraqi newspapers called on 'political entities--parties, groups or individuals--who want to enter the upcoming elections to contact us and obtain the necessary documents to validate their candidacy.' . . . Some 550 registration centers will be set up throughout the country in the same location or near where Iraqis are accustomed to receiving their food rations--a leftover from a United Nations oil-for-food program."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voter registration did commence, as planned[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=9796target=_blank], on Monday, Nov. 1. "Today voter registration is starting all over the country. . . . It is going well up until now," said Farid Ayar, the spokesman for Iraq's Independent Electoral Commission. The goal is to achieve the registration level of some 12 million voters[http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000085&amp;sid=aWWigY3qpQ8k&amp;refer=europetarget=_blank]: "As many as 120,000 Iraqis are needed to run 30,000 polling stations in January." You can see the registration information posters here[http://in.rediff.com/news/2004/nov/02look.htmtarget=_blank].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Iraqi authorities, with assistance from the U.N. and the European Union[http://www.voanews.com/english/2004-11-02-voa43.cfmtarget=_blank], are preparing the logistics side of the elections, the U.S. is committed to providing additional security[http://www.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4057,11150727^1702,00.htmltarget=_blank] for the foreign election workers. Australia will be training and equipping the contingent of 163 Fijian troops[http://www.heraldsun.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5478,11211251%5E1702,00.html], which will provide security for U.N. election officials. The Royal Australian Air Force will fly the Fijian troops to Iraq.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while the January election will be the main event, we should not forget that democracy has been making progress on grass-roots level in Iraq for quite some time. For the latest example, see this story about city council elections[http://www.1id.army.mil/1ID/News/October/Article_44/Article_44.htmtarget=_blank] in the town of Sagaron, in the Dibis District.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While violence continues to dominate the reporting from Iraq, here is a reminder[http://www.kurdishmedia.com/news.asp?id=5668target=_blank] of how much more there is to Iraq than just the trouble spots in the center of the country:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take another look, this time outside Baghdad and the Sunni Triangle. There is a view of Iraq here that you will rarely see on television or read about in the newspapers. It is the relatively secure and peaceful region of northern Iraq, in Kurdistan. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of Kurds spoke to CBN News about their thoughts on the war and America's part in it. One man said, "We thank George Bush and the Americans for freeing us and freeing Iraq. We ask them to please, help us rebuild our country." Another reflected, "To me, the Americans are the friends of the Kurds and friends of the oppressed all over the world."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third said, "It's not just my life that is much better now, it's the lives of all Iraqis. The Kurdish government is a much better government without Saddam, and it is a good example for other Arab countries to follow." Still another added, "The insurgents are scared of the Americans. It will be much better for everyone if the troops stay. If the U.S. forces withdraw from Iraq, the situation will get much worse, and there will be more bloodshed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another recent report[http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/11/01/news/kurds.htmltarget=_blank] from the Kurdish north:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Truck drivers here say they are not worried about ambushes; shopkeepers report that security is not an issue; and local residents shrug off questions about violence and kidnappings. "We have not closed our shutters at night in seven years," Abdul Wahid Hassan said inside his shop filled with brand-new refrigerators, televisions and air conditioners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While cities like Baghdad and Falluja are riven by insurgency, this dusty, sprawling city is part of the other Iraq, a region that stays out of headlines and where life resembles something closer to normalcy. . . . One northern governor talks about promoting tourism, a seemingly outlandish idea in a country gripped by violence but a measure of the security that Kurds feel they have achieved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People find it very difficult to believe that there is a safe area in Iraq," said Barzan Dezayee, the minister of municipalities in the regional Kurdish government, who is leading a campaign to raise funds for water and sewage projects. "We need to convince people that not all of Iraq is Falluja, that Kurdistan is safe," Dezayee said. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today [Kurdistan] provides a glimmer of hope for the rest of Iraq: parents and their children linger at restaurants and shops long after darkness sets in, foreign aid workers walk unarmed through the streets, and the police and most soldiers wear soft hats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report rather disingenuously notes that "while it might be tempting for President George W. Bush to cite Iraqi Kurdistan as an example of what has gone right in Iraq, the relative peace here is not a result of the U.S.-led invasion," forgetting that it is a result of the American victory in the Gulf War of 1990-91, maintained for a decade by the U.S.-enforced no-fly zones, and solidified by the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela Riley, director of School Partners, an educational program under the umbrella of Spirit of America[http://www.spiritofamerica.net/], has been intimately involved in efforts to revive Iraq's education system[http://www.heartland.org/Article.cfm?artId=15816target=_blank]. As she writes, "In December 2003 I became U.S. advisor to Iraq's Ministry of Education. Strapped into a parachute seat, I was flown into Baghdad in a C130 military transport plane, with stomach-turning air maneuvers to avoid mortar and rocket attacks. I immediately began 14-hour work days, seven days a week, in one of the most remarkable missions the U.S. has undertaken since reconstruction of post-World War II Europe." Riley reports on the progress that has been achieved:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teacher salaries were raised from $5 a month to a starting salary of $60 and an average of $300 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new Minister of Education was appointed who quickly assembled a new senior staff. Some 12,000 teachers and administrators who had been members of the now-banned Ba'ath Party were fired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">USAID has rehabilitated more than 2,500 schools and trained 33,000 high school teachers in effective and modern classroom management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UNICEF and USAID distributed school supplies to more than 5 million students and reprinted textbooks, after removing much of the propaganda from the previous regime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Congress has allocated $70 million to rehabilitate 1,000 additional schools, and the World Bank has allocated another $60 million. These funds set the stage for school reconstruction for the next three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. and other donor nations have pledged an additional $150 million for textbook revision, teacher training, and other non-construction projects. Teachers, for example, need to be trained in a variety of teaching strategies to ensure all students learn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ministry of Education has revised curriculum in the areas of civic education, history, and religion and has appointed a new national curriculum commission to revise curriculum in all subject areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Riley notes, many problems remain: "The most serious obstacle to education reform in Iraq is an overly bureaucratic system and a workforce that has been isolated for 30 years." But the groundwork is in place, and with the democratically elected government taking charge in January, Riley hopes a new sense of ownership and accountability will spur further much needed reforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraq's higher-education institutions will, meanwhile, benefit from a better connection[http://www.digitalmediaasia.com/default.asp?ArticleID=4122target=_blank] with the outside world:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Qtel</span> has announced that it will shortly provide internet services to universities and educational institutions in Iraq using the VSAT technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VSAT, which stands for Very Small Aperture Terminal relies on advanced digital satellite telecommunications equipment for data, voice, and video applications. It is one of the most effective technologies used today to meet a diverse set of communications needs providing quickly deployable remote area connectivity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The International Fund for Higher Education in Iraq" Committee had recently signed a contract with <span class="companylink">Qtel</span> through Qatar Foundation for providing remote connectivity to 37 locations in Iraq. <span class="companylink">Qtel</span>'s VSAT network will connect universities and other educational institutions within Iraq and be hubbed through the VSAT HUB in Doha, Qatar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, LG has won a contract as part of South Korea's reconstruction package, to provide telecom network[http://www.iraqdirectory.com/files/articles/article215.htmtarget=_blank] linking Iraq's 19 universities. And speaking of foreign connections[http://www.iraqdirectory.com/files/articles/article222.htmtarget=_blank], "Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research (Dr. Taher Al-Baka'a) announced that Iraq agreed with UNESCO for implementing 4 projects in the scope of higher education. . . . These projects will be financed by Qatar Institution of Education, Science and Society Development."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a smaller scale, an American history professor has started a valuable initiative called Books to Baghdad[http://www.thespartandaily.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2004/10/29/4181fefb50927target=_blank], designed to provide Iraqi university libraries with some new reading and teaching materials: "[Jonathan Roth] said that one of his best friends went to Iraq and learned about university libraries not having recent publications. . . . Roth said he intends the books for the faculty members, who will in turn share the contents with their students. 'I've collected 40 boxes of books so far,' Roth said. Of the boxes, 20 are full of medical textbooks donated by a textbook company. The rest are new or lightly used textbooks or scholarly works." At Jacksonville State University in Alabama, Safaa Al-Hamdani, a professor of biology, has begun a program by the same name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraq's health system[http://live.psu.edu/story/8764target=_blank] also continues to receive help from overseas:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he left Iraq in 1980, Hamid A. Al-Mondhiry vowed he would not go back while "Saddam and his thugs" were in power. Twenty-four years later, he returned to help his colleagues rebuild the Iraqi medical system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A specialist in hematology and internal medicine with Penn State College of Medicine, Al-Mondhiry began working with the Iraqi medical community six months before the war started, at the request of the U.S. Department of State. When Iraqi physicians arranged a medical conference, in collaboration with American military physicians, Al-Mondhiry was "happy and eager to go."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the sounds of gunfire and bombs exploding nearby, Al-Mondhiry and Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center colleague C. James Holliman presented papers at the Iraqi Medical Specialty Forum, held in Baghdad. Al-Mondhiry discussed blood diseases and internal medicine topics at the forum, while Holliman, a specialist in emergency medicine, lectured on chest trauma, international emergency medicine and the future of emergency medical services. Gunfights near the conference site and terrorist threats failed to deter 30 invited American physicians and more than 300 Iraqi physicians from participating in the conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much is being done to rebuild the health infrastructure[http://www.iraqdirectory.com/files/articles/article225.htmtarget=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[The] Ministry of Health announced allocating 85 billion Iraqi dinars [nearly $60 million] to rebuild and supply hospitals in Baghdad and governorates. The spokesman of Ministry of Health assured that the Ministry allocated 67 billion Iraqi dinars [$46 million] to rebuild and supply number of hospitals in middle and southern Iraq, in addition to number of other projects funded by Japanese government through the participation of Minister of Health (Dr. Ala'a Al-Deen Al-Alwan) in Donors Conference in Tokyo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, 38 electricity generators[http://www.iraqdirectory.com/files/articles/article235.htmtarget=_blank] will be installed in Basra hospitals thanks to a £2.1 million ($3.8 million) donation from the Multinational Forces. Mosul University will see the construction of the first bone marrow transplant center[http://www.iraqdirectory.com/files/articles/article233.htmtarget=_blank] in Iraq, funded by a $680,000 gift from the Italian government. In Baghdad, 24 medical centers have acquired new dental equipment[http://www.iraqdirectory.com/files/articles/article230.htmtarget=_blank]. In Doohuk[http://www.iraqdirectory.com/files/articles/article226.htmtarget=_blank] in the north of Iraq, an $11.6 million program is "presenting health services to citizens, building new sections in hospitals, building major drugstore, rebuilding Zhako Hospital, rebuilding the Rehabilitation Center of Disabled Children, rebuilding and expanding Nakra Hospital, building number of health centers in Feeshkhaboor and Ma'abad Lalesh, and constructing doctors house in Duhook."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American veterinarians are discussing the provision of training as well as advice and expertise to rebuild veterinary science[http://www.ascribe.org/cgi-bin/spew4th.pl?ascribeid=20041025.070505&amp;time=07%2030%20PDT&amp;year=2004&amp;public=1target=_blank] in Iraq. Says Keith W. Prasse, dean of the University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine: "In Iraq the faculty are 25 years out of date because Saddam cut them off from the rest of the scientific world when he came to power in 1979. They're dealing with destruction and inadequate energy supplies, and obviously security is a problem, but their infrastructure and supplies are in reasonably good shape. What's missing there mainly is planning to reestablish services."</p>

It's a fascinating glimpse of challenges facing Iraq and their repercussions in the political world of the West. Speaking of industrial relations, you can also read (and even watch) the story of a 62-year-old grandmother, retired Florida Department of Labor worker Duane Underwood[http://www.walb.com/Global/story.asp?S=2502899&amp;nav=5kZQSdg0target=_blank], who for seven months had been helping to rebuild Iraq's Department of Labor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Humor[http://www.iraq.net/displayarticle5722.htmltarget=_blank] is making a welcome return in Iraq:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Iraqis readily admit that humor is not considered an Iraqi characteristic. Egyptians have a reputation as the jokesters of the Arab world. Iraq is better known as a nation of avid readers. But the unbridled freedoms that followed the fall of Saddam Hussein and the misery of a constant cycle of bombings, kidnappings and murders have kindled a national sense of humor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of it is satirical and can be seen in street graffiti that makes fun of everyone, starting with the 140,000 American soldiers in Iraq. Other targets include insurgents, common criminals and political parties. "The black humor you see on television is the only way for us to vent frustration," said Qasim al-Sabti, one of Iraq's leading painters. "We cry one minute and laugh the next when we watch [the latest TV hit] 'Alley of the Junkies,' " he said. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Iraqis see in "Alley of the Junkies" is a far cry from anything seen or watched during Saddam's reign of terror, when Iraqis could end up in jail--or worse--for indiscreet jokes about the president and his family. Now, Iraqis post images on Web sites ridiculing Saddam. One shows him bearded and squatting on the ground, singing about how unfair life can be. Another one shows him lying on his back in a hole--he was captured in December in an underground hole near his hometown of Tikrit--with rats and trash around him. "You are the only loyal Baathists left for me," he tells the rodents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A useful initiative to preserve and make accessible to the world some of Iraq's rich cultural and historical heritage[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2004-10/fm-fm102204.phptarget=_blank] is about to get under way:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Field Museum is embarking on a two-year project that could help bridge cultural and scientific barriers exacerbated by the Iraq war. With the support of the National Endowment for the Humanities, the museum recently began to study, catalog and reconcile the scattered but priceless collections of materials from the famous 5,000-year-old archaeological site of Kish, 50 miles south of Baghdad. Kish is one of the world's oldest cities and site of the earliest evidence of wheeled transport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The museum plans to create a digital catalog of the more than 100,000 Kish artifacts held in Chicago, London and Baghdad. The catalog will be made available in English and Arabic on the Internet and in print. Also, a more complete database of all the objects will be created and made available on the Internet. "This project will make possible, for the first time, a true reckoning of the site's historical and archaeological significance," said William Pestle, Field Museum Collection Manager and one of the principal investigators on this project. "It will also serve as a model for intellectual repatriation of exported archaeological collections."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraqis, meanwhile, are increasingly taking to a new sport--baseball[http://www.iraq.net/displayarticle5733.htmltarget=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yasser Abdel Hussein tugs his cap and unwinds with the smooth sidearm delivery that's made him the ace of the pitching staff. He looks like a prospect. At home plate, however, Mohammed Khaled seems like he's still on chilly terms with his bat as he crouches, resplendent in a red (yes, red) New York Yankees hat, FUBU muscle shirt and tight bicycle shorts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a game of speed and concentration," Khaled says after widely missing most of Abdel Hussein's pitches. He connected just twice, and then only by abandoning all technique and swinging one-handed. The 20 young men gathered on a patchy grass field behind Baghdad University's College of Sports Education may not look like much now. But organizers of Iraq's fledgling national baseball team have high hopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they need a lot of help. Here's a great opportunity for the baseball-mad Americans to lend a helping (and gloved) hand and thus spread more goodwill in Iraq.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Economy. Iraq is celebrating the first anniversary of the introduction of the new dinar[http://www.edinarfinancial.com/target=_blank]. John B. Taylor, the U.S. undersecretary of the Treasury for international affairs, says:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One year later, a new currency is circulating throughout Iraq and the Iraqi currency exchange is hailed as a success. The exchange rate is steady, price stability has been restored, and economic growth this year is 50 percent, one of the highest rates in the world. The new Iraqi dinar is a sturdy and secure currency, imprinted with traditional Iraqi symbols--altogether a great improvement over the flimsy bills with Saddam's face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for the new currency has been so strong that the Iraqi government has earned an amazing $5 billion in seignorage [the capital gain generated by the creation of reserve money] during the past year just supplying it. . . . And Iraqis are using the newly-minted dinars to purchase goods--fresh bananas from the Americas, chickens from around the world, new and used cars--at stable competitive prices in markets in Basra, Baghdad, Irbil and Mosul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, neighborly help for the Iraqi banking system[http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=95612&amp;Sn=BUSI&amp;IssueID=27228target=_blank] continues:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bahrain Institute of Banking and Finance (BIBF) is to offer more training programmes for Iraqi bankers. . . . Three groups of Iraqi bankers have already completed three programmes at the institute, in Juffair, according to BIBF acting director Hussain Ismail. The BIBF is now expanding its training role beyond the region, he told the GDN.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the groups from Iraq who completed BIBF training were 21 senior bankers from the Central Bank of Iraq. They attended a two-week programme on banking supervision at the BIBF, which was run in co-operation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Federal Reserve System. The workshop was conducted by experts from the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</span> and the IMF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Iraqi Central Bank will allow another five Middle Eastern banks[http://www.portaliraq.com/shownews.php?id=600target=_blank] to operate in Iraq, making the total of eight foreign banks licensed so far. In other news, "the senior central bank official said the government would issue more Treasury bills to the secondary market to help create viable domestic capital markets and begin the process of trimming massive prewar debt. The central bank auctioned Treasury bills from the beginning of July for the first time in years, so far selling 900 billion Iraqi dinars ($628 million) worth of three-month bills with coupons ranging between 2.5 percent and 6.8 percent to local banks."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Iraqi government is planning to put its budget in order[http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=94796&amp;Sn=BUSI&amp;IssueID=27218target=_blank], after decades of socialist malpractice that distorted both government spending and the economic life of the country:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Iraqi government plans to phase out slowly subsidies on basic products, such as oil and electricity, which comprise 50 per cent of public spending, equal to $15 billion, the planning minister said yesterday. Unveiling a three-year economic plan, compiled by in co-operation with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Madhi Al Hafez pledged "a progressive programme to suppress subsidies . . . (which) constitute a significant burden on public finances."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, subsidies were used both as part of Saddam's welfare patronage system, and as a necessary income supplement for Iraqis laboring under the U.N. sanctions regime. Now, with changed political and economic realities, the government believes it's time for a gradual phase-out:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Direct and indirect oil subsidies cost Iraq $8bn--$2.4bn of which are spent on imports to satisfy the local market, according to ministry figures. The price of a barrel of oil sold to local refineries is 300 dinars ($0.2) and some 550,000 barrels are sent to the refineries daily to satisfy domestic need. At petrol stations, fuel is sold at between 0.01 and $0.025-per-litre--underscoring the huge expense shouldered by the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil in the financial year 2005 is expected to comprise 93pc of the country's revenue, at some $18.1bn. Iraq itself is predicted to generate revenues of $19.4bn which, coupled with external aid, will bring total revenues to $23.7bn. . . . The 2005 budget is based on a price of oil of $26-per-barrel--a hugely conservative estimate, considering the price of oil, which ended the week at a record $55.50 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth and opportunities are springing up in northern Iraq[http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=reutersEdge&amp;storyID=6558215target=_blank]:</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andraust, an American group in which Khalidi is a shareholder, has agreed with Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani to invest $350 million in villas and resorts and a <span class="companylink">Nestle</span> dairy products factory. "We expect construction to start by the end of the year and see the first villas rented out in 18 months. Andraust is both contractor and investor," Khalidi, whose interests range from oil to medical equipment, told Reuters. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The north could be a model for Iraq. Its success in attracting business will put pressure on the rest of the country to improve security and encourage investment," he said, adding that a tire factory was also under discussion. Bureaucracy in the north, stable since last year's Iraq war, is less than in Baghdad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baghdad, meanwhile, is witnessing a real estate boom[http://www.azzaman.com/english/index.asp?fname=news%5C2004-10-27%5C10136.htmtarget=_blank]: "Trade in property has surged particularly this year when the interim authorities lifted the restrictions Saddam Hussein had placed on the movement of people and sale of houses in the country. Estate agents say the return of expatriates has also fueled the boom in property market. Despite daily attacks and explosions it is now hard to find office space for rent in the capital's main thoroughfares."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To support the construction boom, and at the same time reduce the price of cement, Iraqi authorities will be importing electricity from Turkey to enable cement factories[http://www.iraqdirectory.com/files/articles/article220.htmtarget=_blank] to operate 24 hours a day at three shift, thus significantly increasing the current output.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In oil news, here's one assessment of the short- to medium-term prospects[http://www.timesofoman.com/newsdetails.asp?newsid=3593&amp;pn=businesstarget=_blank] of the Iraqi oil industry:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraq's oil production is expected to reach 3.5-4m bpd (million barrels per day) by 2009-10. Sources from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) told Times Business that oil production has already recovered to its pre-war level in 2004 and is expected to reach 3.5mbpd by 2009. With adequate investment and the use of modern technologies, crude oil production could reach over 5mbpd in the long run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraq has three large refineries--Baiji (constructed in 1982), Basra (constructed in 1972, and doubled in capacity in 1979), and Daura (constructed in 1955)--and several small refineries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All refineries suffered severe damage during the Gulf War of 1991, and all are very inefficient. Substantial investment will be required to upgrade existing refineries and expand total capacity before Iraq can meet again the domestic demand for oil refined products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the next few years, Iraq is expected to have to continue to import oil-refined products worth over $2 billion annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraq has one of the largest estimated petroleum reserves in the world. Based on old geological surveys, reserves are estimated at some 100-130 billion barrels (about 11 per cent of the world total), second only to Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, there is widespread belief in the industry that reserves could be even higher. Iraq's oil is good quality and relatively inexpensive to produce; many fields are large, onshore, and have fairly simple geological structures, IMF said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraq's oil minister has indicated that two upstream contracts[http://www.menafn.com/qn_news_story_s.asp?StoryId=67555target=_blank] to develop the Khormala Dome in northern Iraq near Kirkuk and Hemrin near Baghdad will soon be completed after the negotiations in Jordan. "Meanwhile, a third upstream contract for Subba and Luhais fields in southern Iraq has been delayed as the technical and economic aspects of the deals aren't yet ready. Last year, the official noted that the ministry would start development of the fields this year. Production from all the fields would reach 300,000-350,000 barrels per day within two years from the start of development." More foreign assistance[http://www.menafn.com/qn_news_story_s.asp?storyid=67415target=_blank] to develop the oil sector continues to come in: "<span class="companylink">ChevronTexaco Corp</span>. signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Iraq's Oil Ministry to provide free technical assistance to upgrade the country's exploration and production industry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In trade news, increased regional cooperation[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1099282970416target=_blank] is on the cards:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi arrived in Jordan on Monday for talks on closer economic and political cooperation between the Mideast neighbors. Allawi, on his third trip to Jordan since taking office in June, will co-chair with his Jordanian counterpart Faisal al-Fayez meetings of a joint committee that sets out cooperation in various areas. Government spokeswoman Asma Khader said the committee will discuss Jordan's contribution to postwar reconstruction in Iraq, the possibility of building a 750-kilometer (470-mile) pipeline carrying Iraqi oil to Jordan and providing security to Jordanian drivers who have been targeted by Iraqi insurgents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, 10 such joint committees[http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20041103-090030-7262r.htmtarget=_blank] will be formed to "cover military affairs, security, trade, transportation, oil, energy, finance, communications, education, health and technology. The two sides agreed to join hands in securing financing for urgent infrastructure projects in Iraq in addition to rehabilitating border checkpoints and centers, building a highway between the Jordanian port of Aqaba and the Iraqi border, setting up a free trade zone on the frontier and building a Jordanian pipeline to pump Iraqi crude."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Baghdad, meanwhile, preparations are underway for a major trade and reconstruction event[http://www.iraqdirectory.com/files/articles/article212.htmtarget=_blank]: "The Iraqi-American Chamber of Commerce and Industry started preparations to hold Destination Baghdad Exposition DBX in Baghdad International Airport for the period (15-18) December 2004. The Chamber's executive manager (Mr. Omar Ra'ad) said that ten international and Arabic Companies will participate in fields of technology, cars industrialization, communications, oil industry and other industries."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authorities have allocated 1.5 billion Iraqi dinars ($1 million) for the construction of permanent exhibition facilities and organization of trade fairs[http://www.iraqdirectory.com/files/articles/article231.htmtarget=_blank] and exhibitions to promote commerce. The Baghdad Chamber of Commerce is also lobbying for the creation of a duty-free zone[http://www.iraqdirectory.com/files/articles/article229.htmtarget=_blank] in Basra. And at the borders[http://www.portaliraq.com/shownews.php?id=597], "the Iraqi Customs Service (ICS) is moving forward with customs reform with support from USAID's Iraq Economic Governance II (IEG II) project. As key IEG II technical staffs continue to arrive in Iraq, they are working with the ICS to lay the groundwork for comprehensive reform to streamline customs administration."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help rebuild what before the first Gulf War was a significant regional airline, Iraqi authorities are considering bids by <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and Airbus to participate in the expansion of the Iraqi Airways[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002076033_boeingiraq29.htmltarget=_blank] fleet.

Meanwhile, down south[http://www.portaliraq.com/shownews.php?id=603target=_blank], "the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is constructing 72 kilometers [45 miles] of new track and facilities between the Port of Umm Qasr and Shuaiba Junction, located west of Basrah. The construction is approximately 70 percent complete, and is on schedule for completion by the end of November."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Reconstruction. The BBC profiles several unsung reconstruction success stories[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3947343.stmtarget=_blank] in Iraq:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An off-the-shelf power station has arrived in Baghdad, its massive components on flat-bed trucks which drove slowly along the desert highway from Jordan. . . . The new plant will augment, and perhaps completely replace, a battered old Baghdad power station which hardly ever runs at more than 40% capacity. . . . And most Baghdadis will be very happy about it. In time for the high demand next summer for electricity to power ceiling fans and air-conditioners, this plant should be generating constant power 24 hours a day--for a quarter of a million homes. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Baghdad suburb of Zafaraniya, engineers with the US First Cavalry division have managed and financed a fundamental project. A network of new sewage pipes is nearly complete--mains drainage for the first time for around twenty thousand people who previously had only septic tanks. Many can't afford to have the septic tanks emptied regularly, so they fill and overflow into the street. This project is very popular, and it provides jobs for dozens of young men who were previously unemployed. Local people told me that support for the Moqtada Sadr militia dropped off when these jobs became available. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Jumhuriya, a very poor district of the southern city Basra, there are pools of sewage lying in the street around the stalls of the main local market. The flies are so bad it's hard to open your mouth to speak. But there's hope here too. The G5 military/civil liaison section of the British army has selected contractors to install pumps to take the foul water away. G5 have also provided new enclosures for market stalls away from the filthy street, and they're helping build a new covered fish market. And in Basra--unlike Baghdad--the military do announce their successes, the army publishes a free weekly newspaper called "The Minaret," which details progress with projects like the sewage clearance in Jumhuriya. The paper also explains why it all takes so long--and they believe this helps defuse the impatient anger that fuels some of the resistance to the occupation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the latest official report concludes that the pace of reconstruction[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/11/01/MNGKR9JRH01.DTLtarget=_blank] if finally picking up, although problems remain:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the $24.1 billion that Congress has allocated for Iraq's reconstruction over the past two years, $13.4 billion has now been obligated to rebuilding contracts, the report said. Three months ago, 30.6 percent of the reconstruction funds had been earmarked for specific projects. Now, that has risen to 40.7 percent, the report said. But only about $5.2 billion has been spent. In the quarterly report released three months ago, about $3 billion had been spent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is how the Iraqi authorities have apportioned $360 million[http://www.iraqdirectory.com/files/articles/article228.htmtarget=_blank] provided by the International Monetary Fund:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These projects are included in 3 domains, first stage of building abilities program costing $3.6 million, projects of supplying school books costing $40 million in addition to 7 projects costing $317 million represented by project of developing structures of rural areas and $20 million to rehabilitate schools buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second stage of building abilities program, $7 million to rehabilitate sewerage and water nets in Baghdad city, $60 million for a project of sewerage nets in Al-Sader city, a project of developing sewerage and waters nets in governorates costing $90 million and another project includes rehabilitation of medical sector with $25 million and 5 projects for developing private sector costing $55 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And among the constant reminders of the slow pace, fraud and embezzlement, it is nice to once in a while read a story like this[http://www.usmc.mil/marinelink/mcn2000.nsf/ad983156332a819185256cb600677af3/8ffe890149cf558585256f15004b9526?OpenDocumenttarget=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Marines opened [the meeting] with a "Thank You" to the local contractor who recently saved the U.S. close to $10,000. This amount sounds like pennies when put next to the billions allocated to the rebuilding effort of Iraq, but during a time of strife in many parts of the country, this small gesture is a significant step forward for both Iraqis and Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contractor saved the U.S. money by redesigning a water pump system that will bring clean water to an Iraqi village near Camp Taqaddum, a Marine base close to Fallujah and Ramadi. The new system will operate from a cheaper generator of lesser power output than what the contractor initially determined, said Maj. Luke W. Kratky, the information officer for 3/24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The initial cost of the project was $39,000, however, refinements saved money that can now be used for other projects, explained Kratky, a Bridgeton, Mo native. The contractor could have pocketed the money and never mentioned it, said Chief Warrant Officer 3 Dwight Torres, information officer for 2nd Battalion, 10th Marine Regiment, who headed the meeting. It shows that he is willing to help, and that the Marines can trust him to do good things while they are here, said the 35-year-old Santa Isabel, Puerto Rico, native.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">October has been a good month[http://www.portaliraq.com/shownews.php?id=599target=_blank] for electricity production in Iraq. Two new generators outside Baghdad have added another 192 megawatts to the national grid, eight new mobile power stations at Bayji were turned over to the authorities, and an upgrade of conductors on a 25-mile transmission line between the Dibis and Old Kirkuk substations has again connected the Kurdish region and the rest of Iraq. The report concludes: "October's production in the country has regularly exceeded 5,000 megawatts, compared to the pre-war level of 4,400. Since arriving last year, the [U.S. Army] Corps [of Engineers] has strung 8,600 kilometers [5,300 miles] of transmission line, built over 1,200 towers and added over 1,800 megawatts to the grid."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of such efforts there will be a more reliable electricity supply[http://www.1id.army.mil/1ID/News/October/Article_73/Article_73.htmtarget=_blank] in the Al Sulaymaniyah region:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a region set apart from the rest of Iraq, even the electricity grid is separate. The region is dependent on hydroelectric power, which means when the rivers start to run lower electricity production is reduced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because critical services like the hospital and the water treatment plants require constant electricity, it is the individual homes that are hurt the worse by the shortages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A solution proposed by the engineers was the installation of 15 generators capable of supplementing the current power sources. The public works team then was then able to facilitate the 1st Infantry Division funding for the purchase of the generators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a new project in At Tamim Governorate is nearing completion; the new power station[http://www.portaliraq.com/shownews.php?id=589target=_blank] will add 325 megawatts to Iraq's national grid by the end of March 2005. It has so far generated 1,200 new jobs. "The first of two combustion gas turbines has already arrived on site and its installation is about 87 percent complete. . . . By the end of 2005, USAID expects to add more than 1700 MW to the grid overall."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To further supplement Iraq's growing electricity needs, Iraqi and Iranian power grids will soon become connected[http://www.iranmania.com/News/ArticleView/Default.asp?NewsCode=26586&amp;NewsKind=Business%20%26%20Economytarget=_blank] through West Azerbaijan Power Distribution Co., which already exports electricity to Turkey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ministry of Electricity has recently allocated 100 million dinars (nearly $70,000) to rebuild two training centers[http://www.iraqdirectory.com/files/articles/article205.htmtarget=_blank] for its personnel, at Baghdad and Nineveh. "The Ministry plans to train and prepare staffs of engineering, technical, management, languages, science, and computers. . . .

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ministry of Municipality and General Works, meanwhile, is implementing a program called For Cleaner and Shinier Iraq[http://www.iraqdirectory.com/files/articles/article209.htmtarget=_blank], committing 178.5 billion Iraqi dinars ($122 million) to put more than 40,000 unemployed men to work in various reconstruction and beautification projects.

Not only are these workers cleaning up the streets, but also they are making the streets safer for coalition forces and innocent Iraqis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the program started, Adopt-A-Highway workers have identified and reported a total of 47 improvised explosive devices to the Iraqi police. These workers are identifying potential roadside bombs and taking them off the street, preventing the needless loss of lives of innocent Iraqis.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were even more backpacks[http://www.kwtx.com/home/headlines/1153246.htmltarget=_blank] here: "Members of the 13th Corps Support Command staff, Special Troops Battalion, Corps Distribution Command, 84th Engineer Battalion and 81st Brigade Combat Team distributed nearly 1,000 loaded backpacks to schoolchildren in Bakr Village, Iraq." Meanwhile, Operation Crayon[http://www.1id.army.mil/1ID/News/November/Article_06/Article_06.htmtarget=_blank] continued at Halima Al-Sadeea Elementary School in Kirkuk. And the soldiers of the First Infantry Division's 121st Signal Battalion have recently built an auditorium for an all-girls primary school[http://www.1id.army.mil/1ID/News/October/Article_84/Article_84.htmtarget=_blank] in Al Dawr, also distributing school supplies, toys and clothes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This Marine, meanwhile, is helping to bring some cheer to Iraqi orphans[http://www.presstelegram.com/Stories/0,1413,204%7E21474%7E2489822,00.htmltarget=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The children who wandered the streets and slept in the orphanages in Diwanijah, Iraq, had been stripped of everything: their homes, their parents, their belongings and their toys. The least that Lt. Christopher Smith could do, he thought, was find them some toys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smith, a Cerritos [Calif.] resident and Marine infantry platoon commander, has committed himself to bringing smiles to the faces of the children in Diwanijah, a central Iraqi city south of Baghdad, which he is responsible for patrolling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a routine patrol, he came upon run-down day-care centers and impoverished children, some homeless, some living in orphanages. Struck by the living conditions, he spearheaded "Operation Orphan" last month to bring simple toys and games to children in Iraq.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the help of his city manager back home, Smith's action quickly gathered numerous contributions: "21 boxes of deflated sports balls, jacks, jump-ropes, markers and other toys and games were packed up and ready for delivery. . . . The project has since grown to a nationwide campaign. As much as $12,000 worth of toys are streaming in from all over California, as well as Texas, New Jersey, Washington, and Florida." See the story for details, if you would like to help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ryan Schorer[http://www.floridatoday.com/!NEWSROOM/localstoryN1102HUMANITARIAN.htmtarget=_blank], an Army reservist from Florida, is similarly organizing family, friends and volunteers from his area to send backpacks and supplies to children in Iraq. "When he left Iraq, more than 1,000 book bags had been collected and shipped and were ready to be delivered to elementary students."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The troops are also engaging in goodwill gestures[http://www.1id.army.mil/1ID/News/October/Article_89/Article_89.htmtarget=_blank] such as this:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mayor of Balad Ruz, Mohammed Maroof Hussein, and representatives from the Multinational Forces from eastern Diyala province, gave out 1000 prayer rugs to 21 Imams from mosques around the Balad Ruz district. . . . The gift of the rugs came on the second year the mayor and multinational forces wanted to help the local people of Balad Ruz celebrate the holy month of Ramadan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since last March, the multinational forces have spent nearly $300,000 to repair and build new mosques for both the Shia and Sunni communities in the towns of Balad Ruz and Qazania, in addition to over $800,000 spent on other civil projects throughout the district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there are plenty of consequences of fighting[http://www.centcom.mil/CENTCOMNews/News_Release.asp?NewsRelease=20041068.txttarget=_blank] to deal with:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Oct. 25, Marines from the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit distributed more than $570,000 in condolence and collateral damage repair payments to demonstrate goodwill to Iraqis caught in the crossfire during fighting in Najaf August 2003. Payments began on Sept. 30 and have resulted in a total of $1.9 million paid to more than 2,660 Najafis since then. Payments will continue as long as needed to meet each valid case. Condolence payments, known as solatia, are being paid to express sympathy to those injured or who lost a family member during the fighting. Collateral damage repair payments are intended for Iraqis who experienced damage to their home, business or other property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can also read about how Dutch troops[http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/10/24/news/dutch.htmltarget=_blank] do it in Samawa:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a neighborhood without lights, its pockmarked dirt streets and open sewers faintly visible under the full moon, the Dutch soldiers began a foot patrol on a recent evening. After getting out of their soft-top vehicles, the soldiers entered a street, wearing no helmets and pointing their guns down, chatting with Iraqis clustered in front of their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Hello, Mister!" some boys cried out, and they followed the soldiers to the bend in the road. Driving through the town later, the Dutch called out "salaam aleikum" to pedestrians. Many Iraqis, adults and children, waved at them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part neighborhood police officers, part social workers, the soldiers managed to practice in Iraq what the Netherlands has come to call the Dutch approach to patrolling. Scarred by national shame over the Dutch peacekeepers who proved powerless to stop Bosnian Serbs from rolling into the UN enclave of Srebrenica in 1995 and killing thousands of Muslims, the Dutch have nonetheless managed to keep a soft touch, honed in Afghanistan and now on display in this small town on the Euphrates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Diplomacy and security. There are growing indications that the coalition and the Iraqi forces are winning the psychological war against the insurgents. This, in turn, translates into victories on the ground, as this story about Fallujah[http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1025/p01s03-woiq.htmltarget=_blank] and the rest of the Sunni Triangle indicates:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">US forces said the arrested Zarqawi aide was a "relatively minor member" of the network who "had moved up to take a critical position as a Zarqawi senior leader" because of the attrition of other militants in the airstrikes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is the first time there is evidence that intelligence gathering [in Fallujah] is really improving," says Mustafa Alani, a security and terrorism expert at the Gulf Research Center in Dubai. "The reason is that human intelligence is much improved. There is some cooperation, so Iraqis are now part of the process." . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The major difference is [insurgents] are not enjoying the same support and sympathy as in April," says Mr. Alani. "There is a major shift in people's perception after they see Samarra stable. People are sick and tired [of fighting]."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There seems to be a general softening of attitudes across the Middle East[http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1102/p01s02-woiq.htmltarget=_blank]--sort of:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The US remains the principal "bad guy," but the realities of an ugly war are leading to a more ambivalent attitudes towards the insurgency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Lebanon's Hizbullah, a Shiite Islamist group that Washington says is a terrorist organization, has criticized the extremists. Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, Hizbullah's secretary-general, said recently: "Indiscriminate and arbitrary acts are not resistance. The true resistance should protect its people and not kill them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In general the Arab people are with the Iraqi resistance," says Ahmed Sheikh, editor in chief of Al Jazeera, the Arab satellite channel that has often been criticized by US officials. "But the feedback we get is that people are very opposed to attacks like the killings of the 49 Iraqis. People know they're trying to feed their families and say it's haram [forbidden]. Attacks on US forces, though, are seen differently."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, there is still a long way to go. But maybe this has something to do with the changing attitudes[http://www.centcom.mil/CENTCOMNews/News_Release.asp?NewsRelease=20041108.txttarget=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Quds, Al-Arabiya, Middle East Broadcasting Company, Lebanese Broadcasting Company and Al-Iraqiyah television were forced from Fallujah by [the insurgents] because they were accused of providing biased coverage to Coalition forces by refusing to air insurgent stock footage of alleged civilian casualties. In discussions with Coalition officials, reporters from both Al Arabiya and MBC acknowledged threats to correspondents and indicated that some correspondents had withdrawn from Fallujah for their own safety and were reporting via phone from outside the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Najaf[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002057264_najaf08.htmltarget=_blank], too, the atmosphere seems to be improving:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than a month after a U.S.-led offensive against the militia of Shiite Muslim cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, the historic core of this holy city remains a sealed-off zone of devastation and rubble. Yet many residents accept the damage as the price of restoring stability. "We all live with hardships, but the people of Najaf are pleased with the tranquility and stability they are enjoying now," said Sayed Baqir Qubbanchi, a high-ranking cleric here. "This is much better than the time of war." . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite misgivings about the devastation, there is much relief in this war-weary town that the young men in black with Kalashnikovs and grenade launchers appear to be gone--at least for now. The Shiite guerrillas were unpopular with large segments of Najaf's generally conservative, business-oriented populace, which relies on a religious tourist trade that evaporated with the fighting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large-scale U.S. reconstruction projects were launched immediately after combat ended in the city of 500,000 about 100 miles south of Baghdad. Throughout Najaf, schools, clinics and other facilities are being refurbished as part of the U.S.-funded rehabilitation plan, which includes extensive repairs to roads, sewers and water infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coalition forces are capitalizing on the more favorable strategic environment, often experimenting with tactics like this unorthodox military commander[http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=191574target=_blank] does:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Col. Dana J.H.] Pittard, commander of an American infantry brigade in the once insurgency-rife province of Diyala, is outspoken and his tactics don't always follow the textbook. But he believes they have produced a "recipe for success" at Baghdad's vital northern gateway. It includes everything from driving wedges between rebel factions to forbidding his troops to be rude to Arabs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Harvard-educated military aide to former President Clinton, the colonel from El Paso, Texas, also believes that contrary to what some military analysts think, a conventional U.S. Army unit with the right training, tactics and mind-set can defeat the rebellion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Pittard and others acknowledge the insurgency remains active and could again worsen, he points to evidence of a sharp decrease in attacks in the largely agricultural region of some 1.7 million people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roadside and car bombings, while still a serious threat to his 6,000 soldiers, fell 60 percent from their June peak while direct attacks plummeted by 85 percent, according to the military. As mortar and rocket strikes on Camp Warhorse, headquarters of Pittard's 3rd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, have subsided, body armor no longer has to be worn at all times and outdoor volleyball and basketball courts have come into use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change in tactics[http://www.federalnewsradio.com/index.php?nid=78&amp;sid=146215target=_blank] also translates into changes to training of the Iraqi security forces:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pentagon is making a key change in its approach to providing trainers for the fledgling Iraqi army in hopes of getting Iraqis to take control of their nation's security sooner. For the first time since the U.S. military began training Iraqi security forces more than a year ago, the Pentagon is giving a lead role to an Army Reserve unit that specializes in soldier schooling, but has never performed that mission abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Up to now, the Iraqi army has been trained by a hodgepodge of U.S. infantry and other units. The Army says the decision to send the 98th Division--one of seven units in the Army Reserve that specialize in training other soldiers--will stabilize the effort. The 98th will have a 12-month tour. The division is sending about 700 of its 3,600 part-time soldiers to provide a mixture of training, including basic combat skills and the development of a noncommissioned officer corps, its commander, Maj. Gen. Bruce Robinson, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Iraqi national guard continues to be armed and equipped[http://www.centcom.mil/CENTCOMNews/News_Release.asp?NewsRelease=20041066.txttarget=_blank] by the American troops: "Multi-National Forces donated about $500,000 worth of equipment to Iraqi National Guard soldiers. . . . Soldiers from the 104th, 105th and 108 ING Battalions received 2,100 body armor vests with plates." Overall, the October assistance[http://www.centcom.mil/CENTCOMNews/News_Release.asp?NewsRelease=20041101.txttarget=_blank] included "more than 12,000 AK-47s, nearly 12,000 sets of body armor, 265 vehicles including heavy trucks, 41,000 pairs of desert boots, more than 4 million 9mm pistol rounds, 25 Walther 9mm pistols, approximately 4,500 various-make 9mm pistols, 60 PKM machine guns, 5,248 grenades--including 4,000 smoke grenades, 110 aircrew life vests, 22,637 9mm Glock pistols, 594 RPK machineguns, almost 3,000 handheld radios, more than 6,350 Kevlar helmets, 2001 Berretta 9mm pistols, 18 ambulances, 21,000 sets of desert uniforms, 17,000 pairs of running shoes, 460 sleeping bags, four pallets of medical equipment, 322,000 shotgun shells, and roughly 12 million AK-47 rounds."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraqi national guard medics[http://www.1id.army.mil/1ID/News/October/Article_61/Article_61.htmtarget=_blank] are also receiving training from their American counterparts. Medical training[http://www.noticias.info/Asp/aspComunicados.asp?nid=38132&amp;src=0target=_blank] for high-casualty emergencies is also being provided:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The training consisted of Soldiers' reaction to an improvised explosive device on a military convoy, evacuating casualties, medical evaluation and treatment, and air medical evacuation procedures. The medical teams were combined between the ING medics and the Multi-National Forces-Iraq medics to simulate how a real emergency might take place in a joint operation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Army is also training female Iraqi national guard members[http://www.1id.army.mil/1ID/News/October/Article_49/Article_49.htmtarget=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soldiers from New York National Guard's Alpha Company, 2nd Battalion, 108th Infantry Regiment have already trained five females who have taken the initiative to join the ranks of Iraqi National Guard soldiers. "It's important for me to do this because it is the first time for freedom for the women in Iraq," said Intisar Abbod, a 24-year-old female ING soldier. "So I can feel that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Training and other assistance is being provided not just by the American forces. "Ukraine[http://www.azzaman.com/english/index.asp?fname=news%5C2004-10-24%5C10130.htmtarget=_blank] has agreed to train members of the country's new army and repair and modernize its weapons. . . . Ukraine has 1,500 army personnel in Iraq as part of the US-led multinational forces. Under the deal, Ukraine will provide military training for Iraqi troops and overhaul the country's heavy weaponry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, Poland[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2004-10/28/content_2147674.htmtarget=_blank] has signed a military cooperation agreement with Iraq, under which Poland will train Iraqi army and supply equipment. And the first batch of 20 Iraqi security personnel started to receive training at the Joint Warfare Center of NATO[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2004-11/02/content_2166542.htmtarget=_blank] in Stavanger, Norway:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The eight-day course, which is the first training conducted outside of Iraq, has been tailored to meet the needs of mid- to high-ranking Iraqi security personnel. . . . The course focuses on the function of an operational-level headquarters and includes instruction on crisis management, command and control of forces, the operational planning process, and integration of all aspects of civil-military cooperation, including liaison with the UN and other international organizations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Iraqi police force, too, continues to be on the receiving end of foreign assistance. A report from Samarra[http://www.1id.army.mil/1ID/News/October/Article_50/Article_50.htmtarget=_blank]:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Police here are much safer now, following the construction of six new fortified police stations. Engineers assigned and attached to the 1st Infantry Division built one station a day for six days beginning Oct. 11, and spread them evenly throughout the city. The stations cost about $100,000 apiece, according to Sgt. 1st Class Armondo Cadena, a combat engineer and platoon sergeant with C Company, 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment. Much of that money went to ensuring security. "They will withstand rocket-propelled grenades, car bombs, and mortars," Cadena said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other assistance, multinational forces recently installed 17 mobile vehicle radios[http://www.noticias.info/Asp/aspComunicados.asp?nid=37681&amp;src=0target=_blank] in Iraqi police vehicles in the northern city of Bayji.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also practical training. Soldiers from the First Infantry Division, "with assistance of U.S. Civilian Vanguard International Police Advisors, are training Iraqi National Police on Basic Rifle Marksmanship[http://www.1id.army.mil/1ID/News/October/Article_82/Article_82.htmtarget=_blank] (BRM) skills in Tikrit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increased presence and professionalism of the Iraqi security forces are bringing results on the battlefield with insurgents. Around 160 non-Iraqi fighters[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,11177565^1702,00.htmltarget=_blank] have recently appeared in Iraqi courts on terrorism charges. The Egyptian, Iranian, Jordanian, Lebanese, Syrian, Yemeni and Moroccan nationals face the death penalty if convicted under the Iraqi law. "The Arabs have been referred to Iraqi courts and the verdicts against these foreigners are due to be pronounced soon for acts of terror they carried out in Iraq," said Iraqi Justice Minister Malik Dohan al-Hassan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 160 are a part of a larger group of some 3,000 suspected insurgents[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/10/31/uirq.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2004/10/31/ixportaltop.htmltarget=_blank] arrested in recent security operations across Iraq, according to the Prime Minister Allawi. Among those arrested are said to be one of Izzat al-Duri's deputies and his assistant. (Al-Duri, a vice president in the former regime, is the suspected leader of Baathist insurgents.)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James S. Robbins[http://www.nationalreview.com/robbins/robbins200411010826.asptarget=_blank] writes about the dearth of good-news reporting from Iraq:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can glean scores of interesting stories from the web if you search enough, from service-member blogs, public-affairs websites, and some local papers, especially in military towns. Most of the reporting comes from the units in the field, the people close to the scene who live it daily and know the facts. Nevertheless, it seems as though you cannot give away a good news story about our military in Iraq. The mainstream press is not interested. However, I am betting that most Americans are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judging by the response to this now almost regular column, they certainly are. I would venture a guess that part of the explanation why the American involvement in Iraq continues to enjoy a majority popular support is that a significant number of people throughout the country have stopped relying on the mainstream media for all the news from Iraq. To paraphrase the Spanish journalist, people are no longer satisfied just with "blood, blood, blood" from their newspapers and TV channels. Increasingly, they are looking for "context" and "politics" too, and finding them elsewhere.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael Schroeder  </div><div>451 words</div><div>1 November 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. economy's slower-than-expected growth in the third quarter suggests that the moderate pace is likely to continue the rest of the year, while overall inflation remains firmly under control.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S.'s gross domestic product -- the total value of goods and services produced, adjusted for inflation -- increased at an annual rate of 3.7%, up from 3.3% in the second quarter, the U.S. Commerce Department reported Friday. Economists generally had expected a rate of 4.3%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending, which has been the driving force behind economic growth, advanced a strong 4.6% in the three months ended Sept. 30, up from a 1.6% gain in the previous period. Purchases of durable goods, such as automobiles, rose 16.8%, compared with a 0.3% contraction in the second quarter. Spending on nondurable goods rose 3.9%, up from 0.1% in the prior quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some economists predict that the pace of consumer spending will slow. David Rosenberg, chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., believes that consumers, who had a scant savings rate of 0.4% in the third quarter, are running down their savings at a time when their debt levels are rising and high energy prices are taking a bigger bite from pocketbooks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosenberg said he is "very concerned about the growth outlook" and expects economic expansion "will slow significantly, starting as soon as the fourth quarter." Economists say that growth of 3.5% would hold unemployment steady but that growth of 4% or more is needed to bring the jobless rate down substantially.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More robust growth that usually accompanies an economic recovery is being restrained by a number of factors. "The overvalued dollar and trade deficit, rising oil imports and prices, and rapidly escalating health-care costs are taxing jobs creation and investment," said Peter Morici, a business professor at the University of Maryland.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The closely watched price index for personal consumption rose at a 1.1% rate during the third quarter after a worrisome 3.1% increase during the second quarter. The personal-consumption index excluding food and energy, a number closely watched by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, rose just 0.7%, the lowest increase in 42 years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on the inflation front, a separate report from the U.S. Labor Department showed that the Employment Cost Index rose a smaller-than-expected 0.9% in the third quarter, the same rate as in the second quarter.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael Schroeder and Elizabeth Price </div><div>512 words</div><div>28 October 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. factory orders for big-ticket durable goods rose modestly last month, boosted by increased demand for machinery and computers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for durable goods -- items expected to last three or more years -- increased 0.2% to $195.7 billion in September, following a revised decline of 0.6% in August, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the department reported that new-home sales rose 3.5% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.21 million units, the third-highest level on record. Total U.S. construction activity for 2004 is poised to register its largest gain since the late 1990s, according to a report by McGraw-Hill Construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to this growth picture, the Federal Reserve said business spending appeared to pick up in most regions of the country, with modest gains in capital spending and hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy continued to steam ahead in September and early October, but several districts reported slower growth amid rising energy costs, according to a survey of regional economic activity -- the so-called beige book -- prepared for use at the central bank's next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on Nov. 10.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 12 Fed districts, four reported slower growth, five cited continued economic expansion, two reported faster growth and one said activity was mixed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists viewed the durable-goods data as a positive sign for continued economic growth. "Machinery orders were up 19% this year versus one year ago and demonstrate that business is confident enough about the outlook to replace and expand their productive capacity," said Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist for Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, an Arlington, Va., association of manufacturers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The September report showed rising demand for machinery, up 2.9%, and for computers and electronics, up 9.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low mortgage rates have continued to support the housing sector. September new-home sales were up in all U.S. regions except the West, where sales fell 0.8%. Sales were up 6% in the Northeast, 12.3% in the Midwest and 2.7% in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of construction activity is expected to rise 9% this year to $576.7 billion, according to McGraw-Hill Construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year's activity has been stronger than expected as mortgage rates have stayed low.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. economy continued to steam ahead in September and early October, but several districts reported slower growth amid rising energy costs, the Federal Reserve said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- September sales of existing homes rose 3.1% from August, the National Association of Realtors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales grew to a 6.75 million annual rate in September, up from August's upwardly revised 6.55 million annual pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The good news is that interest rates have been fairly stable over the last month . . . and that is increasing the purchasing power of buyers trying to get into the housing market," said the association's chief economist, David Lereah.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has remained strong this year, despite earlier expectations that sales would cool off.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. rose in September to the third-highest level on record as low mortgage rates beckoned buyers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said that after two months of declines, sales rose 3.1% in September from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.75 million units.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low mortgage rates have bolstered housing activity, which has been a bright spot for the American economy. The average fixed rate for a 30-year mortgage in September was 5.75%, down from 5.87% in August and 6.15% a year earlier.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By Greg Ip </div><div>598 words</div><div>20 October 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan again played down worries of a bubble in the housing market, and argued that speculative buying -- while rising by some measures -- remains low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greenspan, in a speech to a banking group here, also said U.S. households shouldn't have any trouble handling record debt levels, though he acknowledged that worries over such debt "cannot be readily dismissed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses aren't as prone to bubbles as stocks because high transaction costs and a seller's need of shelter are "significant impediments to speculative trading," the Fed chief said. While some buyers have bid through offering prices, they have "contributed only modestly to overall house price speculation," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speculators are most likely to be investors in second homes and rental properties, Mr. Greenspan told the group America's Community Bankers, but those categories accounted for less than 11% of the value of single-family home mortgage originations last year. Still, Fed estimates show that's up substantially from less than 6% in 1998.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the housing market took off a few years ago following the Fed's deep interest-rate cuts, concerns that the housing market is a bubble have mounted. Fed officials have usually dismissed such worries, but as housing-price appreciation accelerated this year, some began to fret.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices were up 9.4% in the second quarter from a year earlier, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight has reported, the fastest in 25 years. In an August letter to Congress, Mr. Greenspan acknowledged the possibility that "real-estate prices, at least in some markets, could be out of alignment with the fundamentals."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, economists at Goldman Sachs said houses are almost 10% overvalued, there are "signs of excess supply" in housing and "home buyers seem to have developed a speculative mindset."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said housing starts fell 6% last month from the previous one, to a still-healthy 1.898 million annual rate. Single-family starts fell 8.2%. Economists had expected a drop because of hurricanes, but the South, which felt the brunt of the storms, actually experienced the smallest drop of the four regions surveyed, suggesting a weak underlying trend. But permits for new units rose 1.8% to an annual rate of two million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his speech yesterday, Mr. Greenspan reiterated his longstanding view that while "local economies may experience significant speculative price imbalances, a national severe price distortion seems most unlikely in the United States, given its size and diversity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Were prices to decline, he said they wouldn't likely fall enough to endanger households' finances. The down payment equals or exceeds 20% in about three-quarters of outstanding first mortgages, he said, though some people borrow for their down payment as well. And in aggregate, mortgage debt equals about 45% of home values. "Many of those who purchased their residences more than a year ago have equity buffers in their homes adequate to withstand any price decline other than a very deep one."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ratio of household debt to income has risen in recent years, to a record. But Mr. Greenspan noted that ratio has risen steadily for at least half a century, reflecting rising homeownership and financial innovation that has allowed more consumers to use credit, and for more purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To be sure, some households are stretched to their limits," he said. "But the vast majority appear able to calibrate their borrowing and spending to minimize financial difficulties." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE Chairman Alan Greenspan said Friday that the rise in the value of imported oil so far this year equaled about 0.75% of gross domestic product. Page-one articles Monday and yesterday incorrectly said Mr. Greenspan said higher oil prices had reduced growth by three-quarters of a percentage point.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(AWSJ Oct. 21, 2004)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan played down fears that the rapid growth of U.S. household debt could trigger a crash in housing prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. consumer prices rose a modest 0.2% in September, while housing starts dropped 6% to a seasonally adjusted 1.9 million annual rate last month, according to separate government reports.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In remarks prepared for a speech to bankers, Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that "some households are stretched to their limits," but he said that most are in "reasonably good shape" and can absorb gradual increases in interest rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most Americans who bought houses more than a year ago have enough equity to "withstand any price decline other than a very deep one," Mr. Greenspan said. In addition, he noted that the ratio of household net worth to income has risen recently.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. household debt has climbed rapidly during the past five years, raising debt to a record 1.2 times disposable income. That trend worries some economists who say households will find it increasingly hard to service their debt as the Fed raises interest rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. central bank has raised its federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, by three-quarters percentage point to 1.75% since June and is expected to make another quarter-point increase next month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Greenspan said the debt-to-income ratio paints an unduly gloomy picture of the state of household finances. A more appropriate measure, he said, is the ratio of household net worth to income. Net worth is now five times household income, he said, up from 4.5 for most of the past 60 years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some of the rise in the ratios of household debt to income may not be evidence of stress," Mr. Greenspan said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, a sharp jump in lodging costs helped push up U.S. core inflation, which doesn't include the volatile food and energy sectors -- by 0.3%, the fastest pace in five months, the U.S. Labor Department said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The department said a 2.9% jump in the cost of lodging -- such as hotels and college housing -- accounted for about three-quarters of the September acceleration in the core consumer-price index, which had risen only 0.1% in each of the prior three months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 0.4% drop in energy prices in September, the third straight monthly decline, helped temper the rise in the consumer-price index, the most widely used gauge of U.S. inflation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, gasoline prices rose a mild 0.1%, the report said. Fuel-oil costs shot up 2.1%, but natural-gas prices slid 3.1% and electricity costs held steady.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This confirms inflation remains steadfastly under control despite rising oil prices," said Peter Morici, a business professor at the University of Maryland.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But experts said the energy figures for last month don't reflect the recent sharp rise in oil prices, which have pushed the price of a barrel of crude to well above $50. Each $1 increase in the price of crude oil translates into 2 1/2 cents per gallon of gasoline. Crude-oil prices were at about their August levels in late September and have been rising since.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Going forward, we can expect gasoline and home heating-oil prices to consistently follow crude-oil prices up," Mr. Morici said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Social Security Administration reported that Americans receiving Social Security benefits will get a 2.7% increase -- an extra $25, on average -- in their monthly checks starting in January.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in housing starts may not be sign of a weakening market. Building permits, an indicator of future building activity, increased by 1.8% last month to a two million annual rate from August's rate of 1.97 million, the government said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The healthy housing market has benefited from relatively low mortgage rates. Last month, the average rate on 30-year loans held below 6% after drifting lower in midsummer, according to mortgage financer Freddie Mac.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family housing starts took a dive, falling by 8.2% in September.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Greg Ip and Neil King Jr. in Washington and Lee Hawkins Jr. in Detroit </div><div>1097 words</div><div>4 October 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy appears to have put its summer soft spot behind it, but the threat of another soft spot looms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rebound in construction and auto sales and continued robust manufacturing activity suggest economic growth bounced back to an annual rate of 4% to 5% in the just-ended third quarter after slipping in the second quarter to a 3.3% rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It does look as if the soft patch is over, but there are certainly risks, particularly with oil closing over $50," said Nancy Lazar, economist at ISI Group, a New York economic-research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, although car manufacturers Friday reported a 5.5% boost in September sales from August, it was driven by steep discounting. Some manufacturers predicted sales would slip in the current quarter, and made no significant changes to already-trimmed fourth-quarter production schedules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending slowed sharply in May and June when oil topped $40 a barrel. Then, as gasoline prices dropped and a decline in long-term interest rates reignited home sales, the consumer revived from an early-summer slump that contributed to employers' reluctance to hire. Now with crude oil prices above $50 a barrel, that rebound is threatened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meeting Friday in Washington, finance ministers and central bankers from the world's seven major industrial economies said that "economic growth is strong and the outlook for 2005 remains favorable," but "this is not the time for complacency. . . . Oil prices remain high and are a risk." U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow said the cost of oil has "created some headwinds for the economies of the world." Costlier oil can hurt the economy by acting as a "tax" on consumers, who must shell out more for products such as gasoline and heating oil, and by denting the profit margins of companies that consume fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude oil for near-term delivery rose 48 cents to $50.12 a barrel Friday on the New York Mercantile Exchange on concerns about production losses in the Gulf of Mexico due to Hurricane Ivan. Adjusted for inflation, though, oil is cheaper than in 1981. Some economists said retail-gasoline prices, which have fallen from May's highs, could rise again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We could be cycling into another soft patch," warned Morgan Stanley economist Ted Wieseman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The presidential campaign is shifting back to the economy, the theme of much of the Democrats' new ad blitz and of next week's third presidential debate. President Bush emphasizes the improvements in the economy; Sen. John Kerry the anxiety about jobs, health care and oil prices. The University of Michigan said its index of consumer sentiment eased slightly in September to 94.2 from 95.9 in August because of worries about energy prices and jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warnings about the remainder of the year came as economists raised estimates of growth for the just-ended third quarter. Ms. Lazar lifted hers to 4% from 3.5%; Mr. Wieseman raised his to 4.5% from 4.3%. Economists generally agree that it takes growth of at least 4% to create enough jobs to keep up with population growth and put some unemployed back to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new estimates were driven primarily by signs of strong consumer and construction spending in early summer. The Commerce Department said Friday that construction spending rose 0.8% in August from July, unadjusted for price changes, to a record annual rate of $1.015 trillion, after July's upwardly revised increase of 1.1%. Still, much of the third quarter's strength was concentrated in July. Growth was spottier in August. Only a smattering of data on September is available, so it isn't clear how much momentum the economy has now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers, however, remain upbeat. The Institute for Supply Management's index of manufacturing activity, based on a survey of purchasing managers, eased slightly to 58.5 in September from 59 in August. A reading above 50 means the manufacturing sector is expanding. The survey's jobs measure jumped to 58.1 from 55.7.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy appears to have put its summer soft spot behind it, but the threat of another slump looms.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rebound in construction and auto sales and continued robust manufacturing activity suggest economic growth rebounded to an annual rate of 4% to 5% in the just-ended third quarter after slipping in the second quarter to a 3.3% rate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It does look as if the soft patch is over, but there are certainly risks, particularly with oil closing over $50 (about 40 euros)," said Nancy Lazar, economist at ISI Group, a New York economic-research firm. Indeed, although car manufacturers Friday reported a 5.5% boost in September sales from August, that was driven by steep discounting. Some manufacturers predicted sales would slip in the current quarter, and made no significant changes to already-trimmed fourth-quarter production schedules.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending slowed sharply in May and June when oil topped $40 a barrel. Then, as gasoline prices dropped and a decline in long-term interest rates reignited home sales, the consumer bounced back from an early summer slump that contributed to employers' reluctance to hire. Now with crude oil prices above $50 a barrel, that rebound is threatened.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meeting Friday in Washington, finance ministers and central bankers from the world's seven major industrial economies said "economic growth is strong and the outlook for 2005 remains favorable," but "this is not the time for complacency. . . . Oil prices remain high and are a risk." U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow said the cost of oil has "created some headwinds for the economies of the world." Costlier oil can hurt the economy by acting as a "tax" on consumers, who must shell out more for products such as gasoline and heating oil, and by denting the profit margins of companies which consume fuel.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude oil for near-term delivery rose 48 cents to $50.12 a barrel Friday on the New York Mercantile Exchange on concerns about production losses in the Gulf of Mexico due to Hurricane Ivan. Adjusted for inflation, though, oil is cheaper than in 1981. Some economists said retail-gasoline prices, which have fallen from May's highs, could rise again. "We could be cycling into another soft patch," warned Morgan Stanley economist Ted Wieseman.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The presidential campaign is shifting back to the economy, the theme of much of the Democrats' new ad blitz and of next week's third presidential debate. President Bush emphasizes the improvements in the economy; Sen. John Kerry the anxiety about jobs, health care and oil prices. The University of Michigan said its index of consumer sentiment eased slightly in September to 94.2 from 95.9 in August because of worries about energy prices and jobs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warnings about the remainder of the year came as economists raised estimates of growth for the just-ended third quarter. Ms. Lazar lifted hers to 4% from 3.5%; Mr. Wieseman raised his to 4.5% from 4.3%. Economists generally agree that it takes growth of at least 4% to create enough jobs to keep up with population growth and put some unemployed back to work.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new estimates were driven primarily by signs of strong spending by consumers and on construction in early summer. The Commerce Department said Friday that construction spending rose 0.8% in August from July, unadjusted for price changes, to a record annual rate of $1.015 trillion, after July's upwardly revised increase of 1.1%. Still, much of the third quarter's strength was concentrated in July. Growth was spottier in August. Only a smattering of data on September is available, so it isn't clear how much momentum the economy has now.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers, however, remain upbeat. The Institute for Supply Management's index of manufacturing activity, based on a survey of purchasing managers, eased slightly to 58.5 in September from 59 in August. A reading above 50 means the manufacturing sector is expanding. Its jobs measure jumped to 58.1 from 55.7. "Manufacturers are willing to hire as long as manufacturing production continues to grow," said Norbert Ore, who oversees the survey. One troubling sign was a continuing drop in the index of export orders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Light-vehicle sales rose to an estimated annual selling rate of 17.5 million from 16.6 million in August, auto makers said Friday. Driven by heavily promoted rebates and six-year, zero-percent loan offers from General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., sales were 10% higher than in August 2003, paced by a 25% gain at GM. Ford's sales rose 3%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GM and Ford, which trimmed fourth-quarter production plans in the face of bulging inventories last month, made no significant changes to those plans. Auto makers and dealers have mixed views of the economy, largely depending on whether they have hot new models. Toyota Motor Corp. saw September U.S. sales rise 10.3% to a new record from the previous year.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central bankers see little risk that higher oil prices will fuel continuing inflation. "Inflation and inflation expectations remain low in our economies," G-7 officials said in a statement. The G-7 includes U.S., Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said Friday in Washington that he is "confident" prices are stable in the euro zone, though he warned of the upside risks to inflation posed by continued high oil prices.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy appears to have put its summer soft spot behind it, but the threat of another looms.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rebound in construction and auto sales and continued robust manufacturing activity suggest that U.S. economic growth, which slipped in the second quarter, rose to a robust 4% to 5%, at an annual rate, in the third quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It does look as if the soft patch is over, but there are certainly risks, particularly with oil closing over $50," said Nancy Lazar, economist at ISI Group, an economic-research firm in New York. Indeed, though U.S. car manufacturers reported a 5.5% boost in September sales from August, that was driven by steep discounting. Some manufacturers predicted sales would slip again in the current quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumer spending slowed sharply in May and June, as oil topped $40 a barrel and the stimulus faded from last year's U.S. tax cuts and from the mortgage-refinancing boom. That, in turn, prompted firms to cut back hiring. Then U.S. gasoline prices dropped, and with that as well as a decline in long-term interest rates which reignited home sales, the consumer bounced back. But with crude oil closing above $50 a barrel for the first time Friday, that rebound is threatened.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the threat is global. Meeting in Washington Friday, finance ministers and central bankers from the world's seven major industrial economies said "economic growth is strong and the outlook for 2005 remains favorable," but "this is not the time for complacency. . . . Oil prices remain high and are a risk."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude oil for near-term delivery rose 48 cents to $50.12 a barrel Friday on the New York Mercantile Exchange on concerns about production losses in the Gulf of Mexico due to Hurricane Ivan. Adjusted for inflation, crude is still cheaper than in 1981.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists said U.S. retail gasoline prices, which rose to a nationwide average of $2.06 a gallon in May and then fell to $1.85 in mid-September, could top those previous peaks. Gasoline averaged $1.92 last week, according to the U.S. Energy Department. "We could be cycling into another soft patch," warned Morgan Stanley economist Ted Wieseman.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the University of Michigan said its index of U.S. consumer sentiment eased slightly in September to 94.2 from 95.9 level in August because of higher energy prices and job worries.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These warnings came even as economists boosted estimates of how fast the U.S. economy grew in the July-to-September quarter. Ms. Lazar has boosted her estimate of third-quarter growth to 4% from 3.5%, and Mr. Wieseman raised his to 4.5% from 4.3%. Economists generally agree that growth of 4% or more creates enough jobs both to keep up with population growth and to put some of the unemployed back to work. Growth slowed to 3.3% in the second quarter from 4.5% in the first.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest upward revisions were driven primarily by data showing strong consumer and construction spending in July. The U.S. Commerce Department said Friday that construction spending rose 0.8% in August from July, unadjusted for price changes, to a record annual rate of $1.015 trillion, after July's upwardly revised increase of 1.1%. The recent growth was centered in housing and commercial construction, reflecting continued low mortgage rates and a fading drag from still-high office vacancy rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, much of the third quarter's strength was concentrated in July, and growth was spottier in August. Only a smattering of U.S. data on September is available, so it's not clear how much momentum the economy has now. Ms. Lazar said her firm's weekly surveys of business contacts found a recent deterioration in business conditions, led by retailers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers, however, remain upbeat. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing activity, based on a survey of U.S. purchasing managers at several hundred major industrial firms, eased only slightly to 58.5 from 59 in August. A reading above 50 means the manufacturing sector is expanding. Its subindex of employment jumped to 58.1 from 55.7. "Manufacturers are willing to hire as long as manufacturing production continues to grow," said Norbert Ore, who heads the survey for the institute. One troubling sign, however, was a continuing drop in the index of export orders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. sales of light vehicles rose to an estimated annual selling rate of 17.5 million from 16.6 million in August, according to reports from manufacturers. Driven by heavily promoted rebates and six-year, zero percent loan offers from General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., sales were up 10% from the same month a year earlier, paced by a 25% gain at GM. Ford's sales rose 3%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, GM and Ford, which trimmed fourth-quarter production plans in the face of bulging inventories last month, made no significant changes to those plans. U.S. auto makers and dealers have mixed views of the economy, largely depending on whether they have hot new models. Toyota Motor Corp. saw September U.S. sales rise 10.3% to a new record from the previous year. In a statement, Jim Press, executive vice president of Toyota's U.S. sales arm, said that "despite continuing fluctuations in oil prices and destructive weather in the Southeast, the industry held tight."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ford economist Jarlath Costello said there is a chance that the U.S. economy could be weaker in the fourth quarter if consumers remain concerned about softness in the labor market and high oil prices. GM's executive director for market and industry analysis, Paul Ballew, said that following the strong September showing, he expects GM to "see some payback" -- meaning a decline in sales -- in October and November. He said GM will have to continue to offer aggressive deals to hold inventories in line. GM dealers are carrying inventories of 1.1 million unsold vehicles, down 30,000 from August, but up about 50,000 from this time last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GM's U.S. dealers share the manufacturer's uncertainty. Many said the zero-interest promotion kept traffic bustling, but stopped short of characterizing the improved results as a broader indicator of an improved economy and consumer confidence.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Shellworth, owner and president of Shellworth Chevrolet, a dealership in Vacaville, California, said sales are typically robust at his dealership during September and October, as consumers rush in to score deals on leftover 2004 models.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The big question is whether what's happening now is a sign of things to come," Mr. Shellworth said. "And my answer is, `I don't know.' When I'm all out of what I'm selling from 2004, I'm going to have to sell 2005 models. Are the buyers going to be as eager to buy the 2005s? We'll have to wait and see."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher oil prices are likely to worry U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who first referred to June's weakness as a "soft patch" driven by energy costs. While the Fed looks likely to raise its short-term lending rate another notch at its November meeting, from 1.75% to 2%, any sign that growth is being hurt by the elevated oil prices will raise the odds it pauses in its rate increases shortly thereafter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At present, world central bankers see little risk higher oil prices will fuel continuing inflation. "Inflation and inflation expectations remain low in our economies," G-7 officials said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales in the U.S. bounced back in August after declining in three of the previous four months, the Commerce Department said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behind the monthly volatility, sales show little sign of accelerating. But falling long-term interest rates are helping to stabilize the sector at a relatively brisk sales pace.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new-single-family homes rose 9.4% in August from the month before to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.184 million, the U.S. agency said Monday. The increase was the largest since sales shot up 11.7% in December 2000, but it came after large declines in the previous months. July home sales fell 7.3% to a rate of 1.082 million units and June sales were revised down to 1.167 million. The government's estimate of May sales was also lowered.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The picture is still of a robust new-home-sales sector, only not nearly as hot as previously thought," economists at Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc., a Wall Street research firm, said in a note to clients after the report.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A mixed housing picture shows up in other indicators. While new-home demand rose amid dropping mortgages rates, sales of existing homes declined last month. The National Association of Realtors Friday reported resales slipped 2.7% to a 6.54 million annual rate from July's 6.72 million. New-home-sales data are reported at contract signings and tend to show a more immediate response to interest-rate movements than existing-home-resale data.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Jon E. Hilsenrath </div><div>480 words</div><div>27 September 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for long-lasting manufactured goods and sales of existing homes declined in August after posting large increases in earlier months, evidence that the economic recovery remained on track last month, but that the pace of activity wasn't especially vigorous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Durable-goods orders for products such as cars, computers and aircraft fell 0.5% in August to a seasonally adjusted level of $195.4 billion after jumping by 1.8% in July and 1.3% in June, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key to the August decline was a drop in aircraft orders, which tend to move in large blocks from month to month. In July, Boeing Co.'s orders for commercial aircraft surged to 75 from 14 the month before, because of a large order for 7E7 aircraft from All Nippon Airways. But in August, Boeing's orders retreated to 20. Excluding the volatile transportation sector, new orders nationwide rose 2.3% in August from July, though this measure of industrial activity was below levels reached in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists keep close track of durable-goods orders because they are considered a leading indicator of economic activity. When a manufacturer receives a new order, it generally leads to additional production and employment can increase. Orders have rebounded sharply since early 2003 after tumbling during the economic downturn. But there are other signs that the pace of ordering activity has slowed in the past few months. Orders for capital equipment excluding defense products and aircraft, which are considered to be a good indicator of business-investment activity, fell 0.5% in August and were below levels reached in March after the decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The economy is good but not great," said Michael Moran, an economist with Daiwa Securities America Inc. "It is not strong enough to put a meaningful dent in unemployment. It is not strong enough to lead to vigorous demand for labor and vigorous growth of new jobs. But at the same time, we're not deteriorating."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes declined 2.7% in August from the month before to an annual selling rate of 6.54 million units. This represented a cooling after the pace of home resales surged by more than 15% during the first half. With the August decline, the inventory of homes on the market amounted to about 4.6 months in August, compared with a backlog of 4.4 months in July and 4.2 months in June, the association said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're at a more sustainable level now, but long term there should be some additional easing toward the end of the year," said David Lereah, the association's chief economist.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jon E. Hilsenrath </div><div>560 words</div><div>22 September 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A21</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of U.S. home construction advanced slightly in August, despite hurricanes in the South and signs that home sales slowed in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported that the pace of new projects launched by home builders advanced 0.6% in August from July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of two million units, after rising 9.4% in July to 1.988 million units. Activity was stronger than economists had expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have worried that the housing market could falter as the Federal Reserve raises short-term interest rates and consumers react to ever-rising home prices. Yesterday the Fed raised the target for its key short-term rate, the federal-funds rate -- charged on overnight loans between banks -- a quarter of a percentage point to 1.75%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday's Commerce Department report suggested that construction has instead leveled off at a relatively high pace. Construction has been helped in part by low long-term interest rates, which have declined in recent months even as the Fed has pushed short-term rates higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We continue to see a healthy home-building market, particularly in our land-constrained markets, even though some of these markets are experiencing slightly slower sales as they absorb recent significant price appreciation," said Stuart Miller, chief executive of Lennar Corp., a Miami-based builder, in a profit announcement Monday. The company said the impact of hurricanes in Florida in August was small and it revised its profit guidance upward for 2004 and 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts in the South rose by 1%, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 907,000 units. The pace of activity also rose in the Northeast and Midwest, but declined in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were some signs of a slowdown in the Commerce Department report. It showed that the pace of approvals for new-building activity slowed in August. Permits issued for new building declined by 5.5% to a 1.952-million-unit pace after jumping in July. Such permit activity is considered a leading indicator of future construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, Financial Executives International, an association of corporate finance officers, said a September survey of 221 of its members showed executives plan to use high levels of cash to pay down debt and invest in new projects in the months ahead. Rising profits have left many companies flush with historically high levels of cash and other liquid assets. But many executives have been reluctant to put that cash to work aggressively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association said 40% of those surveyed from Sept. 8 to Sept. 13 said cash levels were above average and 19% described cash as below average. When asked what they planned to do with excess cash, 46% said they planned to invest in new equipment or expansion, 42% planned to pay down debt, and 20% had no immediate plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a third of respondents were from public companies. Among public companies, 57% planned to invest or expand, 34% planned to pay down debt, 24% planned to buy back stock, 16% planned to start or increase dividends, and 17% had no immediate plans. More than one answer was allowed for the question.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>2189 words</div><div>22 September 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jo Anne Zliczewski cried when her husband proposed uprooting their family from Pompton Plains, N.J., about 30 miles from New York City. But she had to agree that the numbers looked good: By selling their suburban ranch house for a profit of nearly $300,000, they could buy a much larger home in Pennsylvania and live mortgage-free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So began a debate that is rumbling across many kitchen tables on the East and West Coasts: Is it time to take profits on the real-estate boom? The huge rise in prices in thriving cities on or near the coasts has created an arbitrage opportunity for people who have the flexibility to move: Sell Manhattan, buy Montana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past five years, raging real-estate markets in some coastal areas have more than doubled housing prices, while farther inland prices have risen more moderately. That has stretched the price gap between the middle of the country and the coasts far beyond the norm. The typical home price for the 10 American metropolitan areas with the highest housing prices has jumped to 230% of the national median from 155% five years ago, according to an analysis by Economy.com for The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans have been arguing for years about whether the surge in home prices on the coasts represents a bubble -- like Internet mania or the 1980s real-estate boom -- or merely an adjustment dictated by supply and demand. But anxiety over the question has been rising lately amid signs that some markets are finally cooling off. Inventories of unsold houses have begun growing in many parts of the nation, including Orange County, Calif., where the median home price has surged to $655,000, up 84% since 2001. Some owners are rushing to sell before it's too late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diane Saatchi, a regional vice president for the New York-based Corcoran Group, is advising customers to take their time looking. With war in Iraq, the economy looking wobbly and interest rates expected to rise, "who knows what could happen between now and November?" she says. For those inclined to sell, Ms. Saatchi says, now "seems like a great time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason for caution about the market's long-term prospects: It's getting hard for ordinary people to afford housing near the coasts. The median house price in San Diego has climbed to 4.7 times average annual household income in that city from 2.8 times a decade ago, according to Economy.com. On a national basis, the ratio has risen only modestly, to two times income from 1.8.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those approaching retirement, the price gap can be too tempting to resist. Jeanne Rowe, 67 years old, had expected to work for several more years as a technical writer for a mortgage company before selling her home in Costa Mesa, Calif., and retiring elsewhere with her husband, Fred, a former manager at a coffee-roasting company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mrs. Rowe says her four decades of working in the mortgage business taught her that there is a cycle in housing: After seven to 10 boom years, she says, "the bottom can drop out." As for the latest boom, she figures, "there has to be an end because people can't afford to buy houses anymore."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Mrs. Rowe accelerated her retirement plan. In March, the Rowes put a "for sale" sign in front of the four-bedroom house they bought in 1974 for $39,900. On the opening day of the sale, the first couple who viewed the home made an offer, matching the asking price: $672,000. The Rowes accepted rather than waiting for higher bids. "We didn't want to be greedy," Mrs. Rowe says. The profits will help fund their retirement in Tullahoma, Tenn., where they recently paid cash for a $145,000 home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They timed it perfectly," says Valerie Torelli, the real-estate broker who handled the Rowes' sale. About a dozen of her clients have made similar moves to cash out and move to cheaper areas inland, she says: "It changes their life. They never have to work again. Isn't that cool?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gap between the most expensive housing regions and the rest of the country has widened partly because there is a shortage of land available for home building in the high-cost areas. Those areas already are crowded, and local officials often block residential developments that would add to burdens on roads and schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when the lowest mortgage interest rates in more than four decades spurred demand for housing, builders in many coastal areas couldn't quickly find space to put up more houses. Watching prices shoot up, buyers panicked. In the suburbs of Washington, many dispensed with the usual precaution of making their bids contingent on a professional inspection of the home's soundness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, builders can respond much more quickly to increased demand in freely sprawling cities like Atlanta or Dallas, where land is plentiful. Median home prices have risen just 27% in Atlanta and 19% in Dallas over the past five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists hotly debate whether the housing boom is leading to another bust. "The boom continues," declares David Lereah, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors. While Mr. Lereah forecasts a slowing of price increases, he argues that strong demand from immigrants and the children of baby boomers will keep the market firm over the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Robert J. Shiller, an economist at Yale University whose book "Irrational Exuberance" correctly predicted the bursting of the stock-market bubble in 2000, now is increasingly bearish on houses. Noting that prices in Los Angeles fell nearly 30% in the early 1990s, Prof. Shiller says such local or regional busts could happen again in the coastal areas where prices have risen most spectacularly. "These markets are riskier than people realize," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After they had their first child last year, Diana and Bob Pailthorpe knew they would eventually outgrow their 1,250-square-foot home in San Jose, Calif., purchased in 2000 for $415,000. They started to look around in their area. "We realized we'd have to spend at least $800,000 to get a house that was even livable," Ms. Pailthorpe says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the high costs, they wanted to remain in California a few more years because they both had good jobs at technology companies. But they fretted: What if they bought an expensive new house in San Jose just before prices dipped? They could easily suffer a big loss when it came time to sell in a few years, especially after subtracting 5% or 6% in real-estate commissions. In the end, they unloaded their San Jose house for $593,000 in May and bought a new one, nearly three times as large, for $425,000 in Bozeman, Mont.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pailthorpe found a job as a marketing manager for RightNow Technologies Inc., a software supplier based in Bozeman. His wife has found public-relations work there. Their household income has dropped by about a third, and Ms. Pailthorpe has been surprised to find that some things, such as medical and auto insurance, cost more in Montana than they did in California. Even so, the real-estate savings trumped all other financial considerations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ben T. Smith IV, chief executive of Spoke Software Inc., Palo Alto, Calif., says he has lost some promising young employees who decided to move to areas with lower housing costs. "When you begin to see young kids -- ones who are the future of the business -- opt out, that definitely has an effect on how you develop the business," Mr. Smith says. He has moved some work to India and allowed one of his software engineers to work from home in Vermont, visiting California just once a month. "For both sides, the economics worked out better," Mr. Smith says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan, Michael Quinn and his partner, John Soroka, decided to cash out on their two-bedroom condo in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, agreeing to sell it for around $625,000 in mid-September. The proceeds will be enough to let them buy two homes -- one in Bronxville, a 30-minute commute from the gift and clothing shops they own in Manhattan, and another in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. The real-estate windfall makes it possible "to have two places and not be financially strapped," Mr. Quinn says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karen Davidson, a 50-year-old graphic designer, recently sold her loft in Manhattan's trendy Tribeca district for more than $1.5 million and bought a cabin and barn on nine acres in Lake Placid, N.Y., for $65,000. She found that she could do her freelance work there as easily as she could back in Manhattan. One of her main motivations was that she didn't want her life savings to be wrapped up in Manhattan real estate. By moving, she has been able to create a retirement fund for the first time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some owners of vacation homes also are deciding this is a good time to cash out. The inventory of unsold homes in Great Barrington, Mass., a popular spot for vacation homes in the Berkshires, is up about 40% from a year earlier. Richard Jackson, a real-estate agent at Wheeler &amp;Taylor Realty in Great Barrington, says a local home-listings publication "is getting to be more and more like a telephone book." Dick Krzynowek, president of Isgood Realty in Great Barrington, says many sellers are seeking fancy prices for their homes but some buyers are "digging in their heels."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Zliczewskis (pronounced zluh-CHEF-skis) of Pompton Plains, N.J., real-estate profits were a lifeline. John Zliczewski, 51, who holds a bachelor's degree in business administration, last year was laid off from his job as a manager for a software company in New Jersey. It was his third layoff in four years. "Three strikes and you're out," he told his wife.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jo Anne Zliczewski, 45, a mother of four children age 7 to 13, went to work folding clothes at a discount store so the family would still have medical insurance, but their financial situation looked shaky. Their four-bedroom house, purchased a decade earlier for $175,000, was their major asset. After his layoffs, Mr. Zliczewski wanted to ensure his family would have food and shelter no matter how he fared in the job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friends suggested they consider Pennsylvania, where the typical house price is about half the New Jersey level. Mrs. Zliczewski hated the idea of moving away from family in New York City and doubted the schools there would be as good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(MORE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Mrs. Zliczewski began looking at Pennsylvania home prices on the Internet. "I was amazed at the size of house you could get for the price you'd pay for the handyman's special in a flood zone in New Jersey," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, the Zliczewskis sold their house in New Jersey for $459,000. They used the proceeds to pay $309,000 in cash for a much bigger home overlooking a corn field on the fringes of Lancaster, Pa. Mrs. Zliczewski found the local schools better than she originally expected. Her husband got a job selling trailers for temporary office space. Though his new job pays only about two-thirds of what he made in New Jersey, the family no longer has a mortgage payment and can live comfortably. The neighbors include a doctor and a bank president. "We're like the Beverly Hillbillies here," Mr. Zliczewski says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At their new church in Lancaster, the Zliczewskis met Jeff Geoghan, who recently moved with his wife and two children to Lancaster from Orange, Calif. The Geoghans sold a 1,200-square-foot bungalow in Orange for $400,000 and bought an 1,800-square-foot home in Lancaster for $175,000. Mr. Geoghan had to give up his job as an Internet sales manager in California, but he quickly found work in Lancaster as a real-estate agent. He expects to help people from the coasts find homes in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of U.S. home construction advanced slightly in August, despite hurricanes in the southeast and signs that new-home sales slowed in recent months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Commerce Department reported yesterday that the pace of new projects launched by home builders advanced 0.6% in August from the month before to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of two million units, after rising 9.4% in July to 1.988 million units.

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Simon </div><div>1786 words</div><div>8 September 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE RED-HOT housing market is showing its first signs of cooling, and the balance of power between buyers and sellers has begun to shift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes fell 2.9% in July from June's record pace, according to the National Association of Realtors, and brokers in many areas report that the number of houses on the market is beginning to rise. The result: Buyers are regaining some of their negotiating power and sellers are being forced to lower their sights after years of hefty price increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, home sales traditionally slow during the summer months as families turn their attention to vacations and the coming school year. But the heated spring selling season may have set the stage for a fall slowdown. "There's some indication we're in a transition period . . . from a seller's market to a buyer's market," says Tom Kunz, president of Century 21 Real Estate Corp., a unit of Cendant Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And some real estate experts say the recent rise in inventories goes beyond the normal summer slowdown, with more sellers trying to cash out with big gains and more buyers nervous about overpaying at a market peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apparent shift in the market's tenor follows a frenzied spring, when anxious buyers -- fearing they would get priced out by rising interest rates -- jumped into the market. The average price of a single-family home rose nearly 9.4% for the 12 months ended June 30, the largest 12-month increase since 1979, according to statistics released last week by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. Now buyers are getting pickier, though many sellers still expect prices to keep rising at this spring's rapid clip, real-estate agents say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In suburban Boston, inventories of high-end homes have risen roughly 15% during recent months, and many properties are selling for 15% to 20% below their listing price, says Alan Rice, a senior vice president with Carlson GMAC Real Estate. Buyers are increasingly asking sellers to include furniture or other personal property in the deal, says Mr. Rice, or to provide an allowance for new carpeting or a fresh coat of paint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the country, in Orange County, Calif., which has been one of the nation's hottest markets, the change is even more dramatic: The supply of homes on the market rose to 7.5 months in July, based on the current rate of sales, up from 0.6 month in March, according to the California Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, home sales are expected to reach record levels in 2004 for the fourth consecutive year. And with mortgage rates again hovering just below 6%, according to HSH Associates, purchases could spurt again this fall. Indeed, some markets haven't yet seen a shift. While July was slow, "August has been a whirlwind," says Jane Powers, a broker with Ewing &amp;Clark Inc. in Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Chicago, where the market never quite reached fever pitch, is continuing to see steady price gains, says Stephen Baird, president of Baird &amp;Warner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But elsewhere, there are signs the market is changing. One Orange County broker recently offered "a bonus of $2,500, champagne, roses, chocolates, mini vacation" plus the chance to win $10,000 to the agent who sells a penthouse condo in San Clemente priced at $1,225,000. The property has been listed for more than 60 days. "When something is on the market that long, you just take action to try and get it sold," says Marilyn Taylor, a broker-associate with Century 21 O.M.A., which is handling the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Linda Schermerhorn listed her two-bedroom townhouse in Irvine, Calif., in early June for $439,000, only to discover within days that two dozen similar properties appeared on the market. After consulting with her broker, Ms. Schermerhorn dropped her price to $419,000 -- slightly below recent comparable sales -- and spruced the home up with new curtains and towels. Within a week, she had two full-priced offers on the townhouse, which she had purchased as an investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Las Vegas, where prices increased by more than 52% over the past 12 months, is showing signs of cooling. The supply of homes on the market climbed to roughly four months in August, based on the current rate of sales, from a slim 1.7 months in January, says Lee Barrett, president of the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors. One reason for the increase in properties on the market: Owners who bought properties as an investment last year are cashing in. "Buyers now have an opportunity to look at a product without it selling in hours, and make an intelligent purchase," says Mr. Barrett.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent rise in inventories in some of the hottest markets could be a taste of things to come. Mortgage rates are likely to reach 6.25% by year end, says David Lereah, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors. He expects home sales to fall about 5% next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in inventory is good news for home buyers, who face less competition for choice properties. "You still hear of multiple offers, but they are the exception rather than the rule," says Michael Turk, managing broker at Weichert Realtors in Alexandria, Va., where one house attracted a stunning 42 offers in May. Another sign of how things are changing: More buyers are opting for a home inspection. In the spring, many passed up an inspection because it could have reduced the chance of getting their offer accepted, Mr. Turk says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in markets where bidding wars persist, the odds are improving for buyers. In June, the average buyer in Newport News, Va., had to bid on three or four properties before getting an offer accepted, says Liz Moore, president of Liz Moore &amp;Associates. Now, the typical buyer has to make just two offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other areas, inventories have risen to the point where buyers can drive harder bargains. In Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., many buyers are offering 4% to 7% below the asking price, says Charles Gifford, an associate broker with Coldwell Banker. Others are bidding 10% less on high-end homes "just to see what the seller's position is," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russ and Terry Gieselman listed their four-bedroom, two-bath waterfront home in Massapequa, N.Y., for $785,000 in June. Just eight people showed up for the open house, including two neighbors, says their agent Gail Blumenstein, a broker-associate with Re/Max Shores in Massapequa. After several price reductions, the house now lists for $729,900. But so far there haven't been any offers. "I'm thinking . . . it has to do with the interest rate on mortgages," says Mr. Gieselman. "They've gone up a little and that's turned people off."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shifting climate is a plus for buyers on a budget. When Lynn and Bob Merring bid $800,000 for a four-bedroom, three-bath home in Costa Mesa, Calif., priced at $849,000 in May, the seller offered to lower the price by $10,000. A few weeks later, the seller's agent suggested that the couple re-extend the offer, which was ultimately accepted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Properties are also staying on the market longer. In Colorado Springs, Colo., listing times have climbed to 90 to 120 days "for the first time in a long time," says B.J. Burns, broker-owner of B.J. Burns Re/Max Real Estate Group there. Normally, she says, most properties sell within 60 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judy Blea listed her three-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath home in Colorado Springs with Ms. Burns this spring, with an asking price of $179,000. With no sign of an offer, Ms. Blea debated about cutting the price, then pulled the house off the market last month. "There's a lot of houses for sale here," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new dynamic is also leading brokers and mortgage companies to alter their strategies. When homes were flying off the market, many sellers and listing agents balked at paying fees to brokers representing home buyers, says Maxine Golden of Re/Max Real Estate Services in Newport Beach, Calif. Now, they are offering higher commissions and even cash bonuses, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders, meanwhile, are offering cheaper financing and training their staffs on how to best deal with pickier buyers. "We have to change from managing high demand to educating customers more," says Bill Probert, an executive vice president with builder John Laing Homes. "Buyers have more questions. They are more demanding. Every week it seems like there's more inventory."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of houses on the market is finally rising in some parts of the U.S. where shortages have led to soaring prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new supply should help soften price increases, and some economists say it may eventually bring prices down in some places where they have risen at double-digit rates during the past few years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's going to be a day of reckoning," said Edward E. Leamer, an economist at the University of California, Los Angeles. "The question is how that reckoning is going to occur."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any reckoning probably will be gradual. Unlike stocks, the general level of home prices couldn't tumble 20% or 30% in a few days. Many homeowners would refuse to sell if they couldn't get something near their target price, so it could take years for the market to adjust to a new supply-demand reality. Because local conditions vary, prices may continue to rise in some cities while falling in others.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising supplies are particularly notable in California, where the median home price has shot up 21% during the past year to $463,540 (384,740 euros). The California Association of Realtors says the inventory of previously occupied single-family homes in Orange County in July was enough to last 7.5 months at the current sales rate, up from 1.4 months in April. For the whole state, the supply stood at 3.3 months in July -- the first time since February 2003 that the inventory has exceeded three months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories also have risen in some other parts of the country. A survey by Jeffrey G. Otteau, who runs an appraisal firm in East Brunswick, New Jersey, showed that the inventory of homes in the 18 New Jersey counties he covers was up 14% in July from a year earlier. Inventories are up about 10% from a year earlier in Boston but have fallen more than 50% in the New York City borough of Manhattan. In Las Vegas, where the median home price has soared about 50% during the past year, developers are responding with more plans for high-rise housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S. as a whole, the inventory of newly built homes in July jumped 14% from a year earlier. The National Association of Realtors says the national supply of resale homes remains tight at 4.3 months, down from 4.7 months a year earlier. But Realtors report fewer bidding wars and more overpriced houses that linger for months rather than selling in days. Ben Coleman, owner of Century 21 Hartford Properties in San Francisco, said the market is still strong but no longer "on fire."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Realtors and housing-industry executives insist the boom will continue. David Lereah, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, is so confident, he is finishing a book titled, "Are You Missing the Real Estate Boom?" due for publication early next year. Because interest rates are low, he said, many people can afford "exorbitant" prices. Mortgage payments account for about 18% of U.S. home buyers' income, down from more than 30% in the early 1980s when rates were high.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But economists expect interest rates to rise, and some worry home prices have raced too far ahead of income. Median U.S. home prices rose 33% in the four years ended June 30, while per-capita personal income climbed just 10.4%. "You are pricing a lot of people out of the market," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo &amp; Co.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another danger signal is that home prices have risen far faster than rents, UCLA's Mr. Leamer said. In the long term, the price of a home shouldn't be too far out of line with the rent it could fetch, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors note that there hasn't been an annual decline in U.S. median home prices in the past five decades. That is true on a national basis, but prices have fallen brutally in some places, such as Los Angeles, where they sank nearly 30% in the early 1990s. On an inflation-adjusted basis, the national median home price has declined in eight of the past 33 years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Borges LLosa, a real-estate agent who works in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., said he warns his clients they can't bank on continued price gains. "Do I think it is a bubble? I don't know," he said, "but I'm sick of agents pretending like it is an impossibility." He is giving his customers T-shirts that read, "I bought a house during the '04 bubble and all I got was this lousy T-shirt!"  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karl Case and Robert Shiller may make homeowners anxious with their jeremiad on home prices ("Mi Casa Es Su Housing Bubble," editorial page, Aug. 24), but they are very unlikely to accurately predict the future price of housing in America. Basic economics tells us that price movement in free markets is a function of demand and supply. Consequently, for housing prices to drop significantly, there must be either a substantial increase in supply or a decrease in demand. The extensive analysis of homebuilding conducted by Prof. August Saibeni of Sacramento shows clearly that neither is on the horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for housing is determined by a combination of interest rate movements and the number of people turning 30 in a given year. Demand for housing almost doubled between the middle 1960s and the mid 1970s as the baby boomers began to turn 30. Demand then dropped off in the mid 1990s as the last of the baby boomers turned 30 and the baby bust generation started their families. In 1972-73, the nation averaged almost 6,000 housing starts per million people, whereas in 2000-2001, that number had dropped below 4,500 housing starts per million people. In 2003, the number of housing starts was 9% fewer than in 1977 and 22% fewer than in 1972. The number of Americans turning 30 each year is now beginning to climb again. Consequently, demand for housing is likely to grow relatively significantly over the next 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homebuilding industry is not raising more capital to increase supply. In fact, since the end of 1998, there has been one homebuilder IPO, raising a mere $6 million; just enough to build 40 median-priced houses. California is now building about half as many houses as were built in the early 1980s despite the fact that the population has grown by almost 10 million people. Over the past decade, there have been only two years when the national supply of new houses matched or exceeded demand. In the coming years, not only will the demand for housing begin to pick up again, but the country has residual demand left over from the underbuilding that occurred in the 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for housing is a function of demographics and cannot be captured via surveys of homeowners. When people turn 30 they tend to get married, have children, and then need a place to live. If a sufficient number of new houses and apartments are not being built to accommodate this demand, prices will go up. Rather than worry about falling prices for housing, public policy makers in the future are more likely to be concerned about how to encourage an increase in supply so housing prices don't continue to dramatically outpace inflation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A sharp drop in new-home sales in July coupled with a modest gain in orders for durable goods suggest the U.S. economy remains stuck in a soft patch but isn't stalled.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the two economic reports appeared mixed, analysts agreed that they pointed to slightly slower growth as the housing market continues to lose steam and the outlook for business investment remains uncertain. The U.S. Commerce Department reported that new-home sales fell 6.4% last month, and in a separate report said orders for durable goods rose 1.7% as orders for civilian aircraft doubled.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher mortgage rates, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent moves to raise interest rates, appear to be cooling the housing market. Sales of new single-family homes tumbled to 1,134,000 units last month from a downwardly revised 1,211,000 units in June. The average new-house price in the U.S. rose slightly in July to $274,200 (227,092 euros) from $262,500.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. pointed out that the July sales were nearly 15% below the initial June estimate of 1,326,000 units sold. "That's a very large drop and probably too large just to be noise in the data, even though the data are very noisy," said Andrew Tilton, an economist with Goldman Sachs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Moran, chief economist with Daiwa Securities America Inc., said that while the "new figures show a softer picture than previously believed," home sales remain strong by historical standards.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in orders for durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, followed a 1.1% increase in June. Nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- widely viewed as a bellwether of business equipment investment -- rose 0.6% in July.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders for civilian aircraft and parts doubled to more than $12 billion in July, while demand for defense aircraft dropped by 38.4%. But without the volatile transportation sector, which had the largest increase of $3.1 billion, or 5.6%, new orders rose only 0.1%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Lack of momentum for nontransportation orders suggests that the soft patch for growth may be continuing," said Stephen Gallagher, chief U.S. economist for Societe Generale SA.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. factories posted the biggest gain in four months in July orders for costly manufactured goods. Sales of new homes, meanwhile, declined, offering a mixed picture of economic activity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Commerce Department said Wednesday that orders for durable goods -- big-ticket items expected to last at least three years -- rose by 1.7% in July from the previous month. Orders were lifted by stronger demand for aircraft, machinery and communications equipment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase -- the largest since March -- followed a revised 1.1% advance in June. The showing in July also was stronger than the 1% rise some economists were forecasting.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data is good news for the U.S. manufacturing sector, which has regained steam in recent months after being hit hard by the 2001 recession. From January 2001 through July, about 2.7 million U.S. factory jobs have been lost.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, however, the job picture has stabilized and output, driven by a boom in worker productivity, has increased. The U.S. Federal Reserve said factories ran at their fastest operating rate -- 76.3% of full capacity -- in more than three years in July.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve, wanting to keep inflation under control, moved to boost interest rates on Aug. 10 by one-quarter percentage point to 1.5%. The Fed took the action even though Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan had acknowledged weeks before the Fed meeting that the economy had hit a "soft patch" in June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the manufacturing report Wednesday, orders for all transportation equipment rose by 5.6% in July, the biggest gain since February, mostly reflecting stronger demand for airplanes. In June, transportation orders rose by 4.7%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding orders for transportation equipment, bookings for all other goods nudged up by 0.1% in July, an improvement from the 0.3% decline in June. Orders for machinery in July increased by 2.1%, up from a 1.1% rise the month before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For communications equipment, orders rose by 5.1% in July, compared with a 4.4% drop in June. Orders for electrical equipment and household appliances increased by 5% in July, a turnaround from the 5.5% decline recorded for June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department also reported Wednesday that U.S. new-home sales fell more than expected in July to the their lowest pace since December, as higher mortgage rates cooled the housing market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes tumbled 6.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.134 million units last month from a downwardly revised 1.211 million in June, the Commerce Department said. Inventories of homes available for sale at the current sales pace ballooned to a 4.2 months' supply, the highest level since February 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates, which hovered slightly above record-low levels in early 2004, began to creep upward in early summer on expectations of a strengthening U.S. economy and rising short term-interest rates. While mortgage rates drifted lower from summer highs, they edged up last week and new applications for home loans fell, a mortgage-banking trade group reported early Wednesday.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A sharp drop in new-home sales in July coupled with a modest gain in orders for durable goods suggest the U.S. economy remains stuck in a soft patch but isn't stalled.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said existing-home sales rose in all 50 states in the second quarter, although overall existing-home sales fell in July. Lawrence Yun, a senior economist at the NAR, said it is rare for most segments of the U.S. housing market to move in one direction all at once. Such broad moves are generally driven by changes in interest rates, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR's data confirm previous reports showing that robust demand for housing in the spring was driven by the entry into the market of "fence sitters" who had been waiting for mortgage rates to trough. In May and June, as the likelihood that the Fed would begin tightening interest rates increased, many of these buyers piled into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The July rise in orders for durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, followed a 1.1% increase in June. Nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- widely viewed as a bellwether of business equipment investment -- rose 0.6% in July.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing homes in the U.S. fell a larger-than-expected 2.9% in July, according to a survey by the National Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales dropped to a 6.72 million annual rate last month from June's revised 6.92 million annual pace. June resales previously were reported at a 6.95 million annual rate, a 2.1% rise from May's record level.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors group now expects U.S. sales to top 6.4 million in 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are those that talk about price bubbles and I continue to tell you there are no price bubbles," said the group's chief economist, David Lereah. "Prices are surging, particularly in the West, where they rose 17%," he said. "We have a supply problem."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, where the boom has been particularly strong, the median price of a single-family detached home in July was $463,540 (381,630 euros). That was down 1.1% from June, but up 21% from July 2003. The inventory of unsold homes was 3.3 months, up from two months a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales declined in all regions except the South, where they rose 0.4%. Home resales fell 1.4% in the Northeast, 4.8% in the Midwest and 6.6% in the West.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The July report failed to meet Wall Street expectations, but Mr. Lereah said the numbers were the third-best annualized rate of home resales to date and the first drop since January, reflecting rising interest rates. Analysts expected existing-home sales to decline 2.2% to a 6.8 million rate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home mortgage rates settled below 6% in recent weeks to an average of 5.81% last week, according to a survey compiled by Freddie Mac, a government-chartered mortgage buyer. The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hovered around 6% for most of July, compared with an average of 6.29% in June and 6.27% in May.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, the inventory of existing homes on the market remained stable at 4.3 months, up slightly from a revised 4.2 months in June, the National Association of Realtors said. The median home price rose to $191,300 in July, compared with a revised $191,000 in June. The average home price edged down to $244,700 in July from a revised $245,500 in June.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing homes in the U.S. softened during July, dropping by a larger-than-expected 2.9%, according to a survey by the National Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales fell to a 6.72 million annual rate last month, down from June's revised 6.92 million annual pace. June resales had previously been reported at a 6.95 million annual rate, a 2.1% rise from May's record level.  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Hot Housing Market Simmers Down --- Existing-Home Sales Fell In July, Prices Were Stable; California's Supply Swelled</span>
</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty and Dawn Kopecki </div><div>700 words</div><div>25 August 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is showing signs of cooling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of previously occupied homes sold in July declined 2.9% from June's record pace, and the median price of those homes was essentially unchanged, the National Association of Realtors reported. In California, the median price of homes slipped 1.1% from a month earlier, as agents found themselves with an increasing number of houses on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors insist the boom that has enriched American homeowners during the past five years isn't over. "There are those who talk about price bubbles, and I continue to tell you there are no price bubbles," said David Lereah, chief economist for the association. He said the supply of new homes remains tight by historical standards in much of the country. Meanwhile, mortgage interest rates have fallen in the past few weeks, making house payments more affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, some home shoppers are becoming less aggressive in their bids amid fears that a slowing domestic economy and an eventual rise in interest rates could end, or at least interrupt, the boom. At the same time, the huge increase in home values in the past few years has emboldened some sellers to put unrealistic prices on their homes. A widening gap between bids and offering prices in some areas has slowed sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, in a letter to the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee released yesterday,seemed to suggest he shares some of these concerns. Responding to questions about the U.S. housing market and other issues posed by Sen. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.) following Mr. Greenspan's appearance before the panel last month, the Fed chairman said he agreed with the assessment of Fed Governor Donald Kohn, who in a speech this year said "the odds have risen" that house prices in some parts of the country could be too high for current market conditions. He added that the Fed is monitoring real-estate prices closely in developing its economic projections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market "is not quite as wacky as it was, but it's still strong," said Pamela Liebman, chief executive of the Corcoran Group, a large real-estate brokerage firm in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a national basis, home resales slipped to an annual rate of 6.72 million units last month from June's revised 6.92 million annual pace. Despite the fall, July was the third-highest monthly level on record, Mr. Lereah said. Sales were down in all regions except the South, where sales rose 0.4%. Home resales fell 1.4% in the Northeast, 4.8% in the Midwest and 6.6% in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of resale homes on the market was equivalent to a 4.3-month supply, slightly up from a revised 4.2 months in June, the association said. The median home price was $191,300, up 8.7% from a year earlier but barely changed from a revised $191,000 in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, where the boom has been particularly strong, the median price of a single-family detached home in July was $463,540. That was down 1.1% from June but up 21% from July 2003. The inventory of unsold homes was 3.3 months, up from two months a year earlier. It was the first time since February 2003 that the inventory has exceeded three months, according to the California branch of the Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interest charged on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased in May and June but has fallen in recent weeks, hitting an average of 5.81% last week, according to a survey compiled by Freddie Mac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department is due to report July sales of newly constructed homes today. Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires and CNBC expect a decline of 2.3% to an annual rate of about 1.3 million.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Greg Ip  </div><div>721 words</div><div>18 August 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. consumers got some relief on the rising cost of living in July as a drop in gasoline prices brought the inflation rate down for the first time since February. Although crude-oil prices have risen further in August, some analysts think gasoline prices may have peaked.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, in two reports suggesting the economy regained its footing in July, industrial production rose 0.4% after falling 0.5% in June, and housing starts jumped 8.3% to an annual rate of 1.978 million. The evidence on the vigor of economic growth right now remains mixed, however.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consumer price index fell 0.1% in July from June, the Labor Department said, mostly due to a drop in gasoline prices. As a result, the year-over-year increase in consumer prices fell to 3% in July from 3.3% in June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a related report, the Labor Department said that the drop in consumer prices helped inflation-adjusted weekly earnings jump 0.7% in July from June. But this recovered just half the 1.5% loss of purchasing power of the prior five months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding food and energy, "core" consumer prices rose just 0.1% in July from June, the second such tame monthly reading, as education, medical and housing inflation all moderated and car prices declined due to sales incentives. That pulled the year-over-year core inflation rate down to 1.8% from 1.9% in June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That should comfort the Federal Reserve, which is counting on inflation remaining low so it may continue raising interest rates from ultralow levels at a slow, measured pace.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buttressing the view that inflation is moderating, a survey by the National Federation of Independent Business found price increases at small firms have slowed. A net 20% of member firms raised prices in July, down from 29% in June. The net figure is the percentage raising prices minus the percentage cutting prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts are divided on the course for gasoline prices. They were driven higher in the spring and early summer by higher crude costs and constrained refinery capacity, said Larry Goldstein, president of Petroleum Industry Research Associates, a New York energy-consulting firm. That drove refiners' profit margins sharply higher. They have since fallen back to normal levels.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, despite crude oil hitting new highs, gasoline prices have dropped, according to the U.S. Energy Department. Mr. Goldstein said with summer demand ebbing and refineries soon switching to more easily produced winter grades, the peak in gasoline prices may have passed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, a research firm in Valhalla, New York, said a recent increase in wholesale gasoline prices suggests that retail costs could be headed back up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Fed said industrial production rose 0.4% last month. A decline in utilities output was offset by a 0.6% advance in manufacturing output.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A couple of reports painted a slightly brighter picture of the U.S. economy, but neither suggested that it is roaring back.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production rose 0.4% last month after falling 0.5% in June, and total housing starts jumped 8.3% to an annual rate of 1.978 million. In addition, a drop in gasoline prices brought the U.S. inflation rate down for the first time since February.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the upbeat July reports, they don't show the American economy rebounding to its strong winter pace, and the continued upward march in crude-oil prices and recent disappointing reports from major technology companies also are a cloud over the near-term business outlook.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve said industrial production rose 0.4% last month. A decline in utilities output was offset by a 0.6% advance in manufacturing output. Industry operated at 77.1% of capacity, up from June's revised level of 76.9%. Excluding mining and utility plants, manufacturers operated at 76.3% of capacity, up from June's revised level of 75.9%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High tech led the production increase. Semiconductor production rose 2.7% in July, computers and office-equipment production rose 1.9%, and production of communications equipment rose 2.8%. Motor vehicles and parts production fell 0.7% in July after a 2.1% decline in both June and May. Production of consumer automotive products edged down 0.1% last month after a 2.3% drop in June and a 2% fall in May.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department said single-family housing starts rose 8.5% in July from June, while multifamily starts, or starts on apartment buildings, dropped 6.5%. Starts rose in all regions of the U.S. amid favorable weather conditions. Building permits, an indicator of future building activity, rose 5.7% to a 2.055 million annual rate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates have dropped in recent months as weaker economic reports have prompted markets to assume a slower increase in interest rates by the Fed. That has helped extend the housing boom, against expectations that it would be easing by now.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consumer-price index fell 0.1% in July from June, the Labor Department said, mostly because of a drop in the price of gasoline. As a result, the year-over-year change in consumer prices fell to 3% in July from 3.3% in June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a related report, the Labor Department said the drop in consumer prices, combined with advances in hours and hourly earnings in July, meant inflation-adjusted weekly earnings jumped 0.7% in July from June. But this recovered just half of the 1.5% loss of purchasing power of the previous five months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding food and energy, "core" consumer prices rose just 0.1% in July from June, the second such tame monthly reading as education, medical and housing inflation moderated and car prices declined thanks to fresh sales incentives. That pulled the year-over-year core inflation rate down to 1.8% from 1.9% in June. The report could provide comfort to the Fed, which had predicated its plan to raise interest rates only gradually from ultralow levels on inflation remaining low.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts said gasoline prices may have peaked. They were driven higher in the spring and early summer not just by higher crude costs but by constrained refinery capacity, said Larry Goldstein, president of Petroleum Industry Research Associates, a New York energy-consulting firm. As a result, refiners' profit margins soared to $8 in May from $4 a barrel at Gulf Coast refineries in the third week of March.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, margins have come back down to about $3.30, Mr. Goldstein said, which is in the normal range. That is why gasoline prices have edged down to $1.84 a gallon nationwide this week from a peak of $2.03 in late May, according to the Energy Department, even as crude prices hit highs.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Greg Ip </div><div>761 words</div><div>18 August 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. consumers got some relief on the rising cost of living in July as a decline in gasoline prices brought the inflation rate down for the first time since February. Although crude-oil prices have risen further in August, analysts are divided on whether gasoline prices are headed much higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, in two reports suggesting that the economy regained its footing in July, industrial production rose 0.4% after falling 0.5% in June, and housing starts jumped 8.3% to an annual rate of 1,978,000. The evidence on the vigor of economic growth right now remains mixed, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consumer-price index fell 0.1% in July from June, the Labor Department said, mostly because of a decline in gasoline prices. As a result, the year-over-year increase in consumer prices fell to 3% in July from 3.3% in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a related report, the Labor Department said the decline in consumer prices helped inflation-adjusted weekly earnings jump 0.7% in July from June. Still, this recovered just half the 1.5% loss of purchasing power of the prior five months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding food and energy, so-called core consumer prices rose just 0.1% in July from June, the second such tame monthly reading in a row, as education, medical and housing inflation all moderated and car prices declined as a result of sales incentives. That pulled the year-over-year core inflation rate down to 1.8% from 1.9% in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That should comfort the Federal Reserve, which is counting on inflation remaining low so it may continue raising interest rates from ultralow levels at a slow, measured pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buttressing the view that inflation is moderating, a survey by the National Federation of Independent Business found price increases at small firms have slowed. A net 20% of member firms raised prices in July, down from 29% in June. The net figure is the percentage raising prices minus the percentage cutting prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts are divided on the course for gasoline prices. Prices were driven higher in the spring and early summer by higher crude-oil costs and constrained refinery capacity, said Larry Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a New York energy-research group. That drove refiners' profit margins sharply higher, though margins have since fallen back to more-normal levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, despite crude oil hitting new highs, gasoline prices have fallen, according to the U.S. Energy Department. Mr. Goldstein said with summer demand ebbing and refineries soon switching to more easily produced winter grades, barring significant increases in crude, the peak in gasoline prices may have passed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, a research firm in Valhalla, N.Y., said a recent increase in wholesale gasoline prices suggests that retail costs could be headed back up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Fed said industrial production rose 0.4% last month. A decline in utilities output was offset by a 0.6% advance in manufacturing output. Excluding mining and utility plants, manufacturers operated at 76.3% of capacity, up from June's revised 75.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High technology led the production increase. Semiconductor production rose 2.7% in July, computers and office equipment rose 1.9% and production of communications equipment rose 2.8%. Motor vehicles and parts production fell 0.7% in July after 2.1% declines in both June and May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report, the Commerce Department said single-family home starts rose 8.5% in July from June, while multifamily-home starts -- apartment buildings -- fell 6.5%. Starts rose in all regions of the country amid favorable weather conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, an indicator of future building activity, rose 5.7% to a 2,055,000 annual rate. The housing sector has remained stronger for longer than expected in part because mortgage rates have declined in the wake of recent weaker economic reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shepherdson said reports for July so far are "quite encouraging," but surveys that hint at a decline in business confidence "would suggest the corporate sector is beginning to wobble a bit in the face of a continuing slowdown in consumption."

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anka's High Note</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SINGER AND SONGWRITER Paul Anka recently paid $1 million for a condo at the Park Towers condominium in Las Vegas, public records show. The contemporary of Elvis Presley and composer of "Put Your Head on My Shoulder" and the theme from "The Tonight Show" in its Johnny Carson days bought a two-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath, 2,100-square-foot apartment in the 17-story luxury building. Earlier this summer, Mr. Anka and his ex-wife, Anne, sold their home in a gated community near Beverly Hills for $5.9 million. Mr. Anka declined to comment. Park Towers, located at Howard Hughes Center and started in the late 1990s, was one of the first two luxury residential high-rise condominiums to go up in Vegas (the other, also a late '90s development, is Turnberry Place). Casino mogul Steve Wynn and real-estate developer Irving Molasky developed Park Towers, a two-tower building with concierge service and its own spa. Other residents of Park Towers include Tim Poster, the Internet mogul turned Golden Nugget casino owner, and the co-owner of the Golden Nugget, Tom Breitling (the two star in Fox's new reality show "The Casino"). Lately Las Vegas has seen a boom in high-rise construction. Eleven new condos are preselling units, says agent Cindy DellaValle of Vertical Properties Group and, based on her own estimates, she expects new projects to nearly double in the next two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whoopi in Vermont</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ACTRESS Whoopi Goldberg paid $950,000 for a 745-acre retreat near Brattleboro, Vt., a few months ago, public records show. The property, which had been listed at $985,000, includes a Colonial-style clapboard house. The sellers were Jennifer Ramstetter, a college biology professor, and her husband, Brian McNeice, a farmer. The partially fenced land comes with a barn, pond, stream, river, a shed, mountain views and wooded trails. Berkley &amp;Veller Greenwood Country Realtors listed and sold the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Palm Beach's Hot Summer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THIS IS SUPPOSED to be the slow season for Palm Beach real estate, but the home of Lawrence Ladove -- former president of LaDove, a Miami Lakes, Fla., personal-care products company now run by his daughter, Sheree -- was listed at $15 million in mid-July, and went into contract a week later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home View / Refinancing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE UPTICK IN interest rates, as many predicted, has drastically slowed consumer interest in refinancing. In its latest long-range forecast, the Mortgage Bankers Association predicts that refinancings will drop 54%, to $191 billion, in the third quarter of 2004 from the second quarter. The trade association also expects that refinancings will only reach $127 billion in the fourth quarter of this year, a 34% decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a recent survey of 881 respondents around the country by Domania.com, found that while nearly 30% have refinanced multiple times since they've been homeowners, only 13% say they're still planning on refinancing. </p>

</div><div class="author">A Wall Street Journal News Roundup </div><div>476 words</div><div>3 August 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factory activity in the U.S. increased in July amid a jump in new orders and production, a private survey found. Inflation pressures moderated though remained high, while hiring slowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management's July manufacturing index rose to 62 points from 61.1 in June. Economists had expected a reading of 61.6, according to a survey by and CNBC. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. Of 20 industries surveyed, 18 reported growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The manufacturing sector continues to grow at a rapid rate," said Norbert J. Ore, chairman of the institute's survey committee. "The growth of new orders and production accelerated during the month, adding strength to the index."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute noted that with July's report, overall readings in the survey have been above 60 for nine months, the longest stretch since the period between July 1972 and June 1973. If the July reading of 62 were to be maintained for an extended period, it would be consistent with a 7% annualized increase in the U.S.'s gross domestic product, or the total value of goods and services produced there, the institute said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the survey, the new-orders index rose to 64.7 from 60 in June, while the production index climbed to 66.1 from 63.2. Meanwhile, the employment reading fell to 57.3 from 59.7. Inventories contracted to 49.9 from 51.1, and order backlogs fell to 58 from 58.5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley, wrote to clients that the downturn in the employment index "was not nearly large enough" to alter forecasts for Friday's report on July nonfarm payrolls. On average, economists predict the U.S. economy added 215,000 new jobs in July, according to Dow Jones Newswires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the 29th consecutive month, manufacturers faced higher prices, though price growth was slower in July. The institute noted that "energy prices remain a major concern for purchasers, as prices are at or near record highs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude-oil futures have marched higher in recent days -- ending up two cents at $43.82 cents a barrel in New York trading -- amid supply jitters and new terrorism warnings in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department said total construction spending in June fell 0.3%, the first decline since January, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $985.16 billion. That followed a revised 0.1% gain in construction spending in May, which had been estimated as a 0.3% rise. On an annual basis, total construction spending was 8.6% higher.</p>
