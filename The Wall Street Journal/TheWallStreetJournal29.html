<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Grubb &amp; Ellis Co</span>., one of the oldest commercial-real-estate brokerages in the U.S., was facing a bleak future in 1996 when Detroit real-estate investor C. Michael Kojaian rode to the rescue, helping to recapitalize it by buying a 5% stake. The company is on "a solid foundation," he said at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now it is Mr. Kojaian, the firm's chairman and largest shareholder, who is looking for help. After sustaining a $78.4 million loss in 2010 and straining under its debt, Grubb said last month that it has hired JMP Securities to help it explore "strategic options," including a sale or merger. Mr. Kojaian owns 32.8% of Grubb's common stock if he converts all of his preferred shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One possible buyer is private-equity investor <span class="companylink">Colony Capital LLC</span>. Grubb disclosed last week that Colony provided it an $18 million short-term loan at an 11% interest rate. In addition, Colony received a 60-day exclusive period to evaluate a potential larger investment with Grubb. If such a deal is struck, Grubb has 25 days to find a better offer. Colony declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moves come at a time when Grubb, of Santa Ana, Calif., has fallen behind its competitors. While the stocks of firms like <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Inc</span>. are trading near 52-week highs, Grubb's shares have been struggling below $2 for much of the past year and below $1 for the past two weeks. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading Tuesday, Grubb's shares rose 1.4%, to 72 cents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grubb has struggled partly because its peers are larger and more profitable than it is. In comparison to Grubb's 2010 net loss of $78.4 million, CBRE posted $201.3 million of net income last year and Jones Lang posted $154 million. Brandon Dobell, an analyst who tracks brokerages for <span class="companylink">William Blair &amp; Co</span>., summed up Grubb's struggles as "a convergence of ill-timed decisions, a very difficult commercial real-estate environment and the challenges of competing with some very large and specialized players."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A chief concern is Grubb's debt, which totals $30 million of convertible bonds, $16 million in corporate debt, a $10 million mortgage and $90 million of preferred stock. The brokerage's effort to get holders of the convertible bonds to agree to changes in default guidelines has met resistance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For his part, Mr. Kojaian remains bullish about Grubb. He declined to comment on whether he might again recapitalize the company or take it private. "We feel the company is very well-positioned," he said in an interview Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry analysts and executives tie Grubb's problems partly to the commercial-real-estate market, which during the downturn has seen a drop in leasing and sales activity. While volume has picked up in the past six months, it still is far from where it was during the boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Grubb has suffered by not being as successful as its competitors as rolling out new services. Both <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> and CBRE expanded into selling services to corporations eager to outsource real-estate operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than expanding into this area, Grubb opted to branch into managing real-estate investments. It did so by merging in 2007 with closely held NNN Realty Advisors. NNN, formerly called Triple Net Properties, specialized in forming and managing real-estate investment trusts and managing tenant-in-common, or TIC, deals in which small investors collectively invest in commercial properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the merger, the TIC business has weighed on Grubb's financial results. The number of TIC deals, as well as fees resulting from them, plummeted in the recession because many small investors soured on such deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Grubb's TIC division generated a $6 million loss in operating income, according to research by JMP Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked who spearheaded Grubb's merger with NNN, Mr. Kojaian said the entire board made the decision. "I look through the windshield, not the rearview mirror," he said. "We made a good decision at the time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grubb's latest travails cap 30 years of upheaval for the firm. Founded as a residential brokerage in 1958, Grubb went on an acquisition spree in the 1980s, buying brokerages in major markets to expand nationally. However, the company failed to meld those operations with its own, couldn't retain some brokers and buckled under debt from the purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 1992, Grubb, facing financial ruin, restructured debt from its acquisition by selling a 40% stake to Warburg, Pincus Investors LP and converting debt held by <span class="companylink">Prudential Insurance Co. of America</span> to a 27% equity stake. In 1996, Mr. Kojaian joined as an investor, receiving stock in exchange for providing $10 million that Grubb used to pay down its debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The private real-estate empire owned by Mr. Kojaian, 49 years old, has ranged over the years from eight million square feet to 20 million, mostly in office and industrial properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics of Grubb said the firm suffered from lack of direction before and after Mr. Kojaian got involved. In the past 10 years, the brokerage has changed CEOs six times. Current CEO Thomas D'Arcy joined in 2009. <span class="companylink">Grubb &amp; Ellis</span> declined to comment about its CEO turnover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, in a bid to boost its brokerage business, Grubb has increased the "split," the percentage of commissions that brokers get to keep. The firm hoped to attract better brokers by offering them roughly 65%, compared with the 50% to 55% being offered by other firms. But the move cut into the firm's profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kojaian remains optimistic. "We're positioned to be one of the beneficiaries of the improvement in the marketplace," he said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The extended family is making a comeback -- and presenting new financial opportunities and challenges for those willing to share living arrangements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, a record 49 million Americans, or 16.1% of the population, lived in households with at least two adult generations or a grandparent plus one other generation, according to the nonprofit Pew Research Center in Washington. That is up 17% from 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend is being driven in part by the economic downturn and the aging of the population. "With pensions failing and retirees experiencing shortfalls in savings, it's going to become even more popular," says John L. Graham, professor emeritus at the University of California, Irvine's Paul Merage School of Business and co-author of "Together Again: A Creative Guide to Successful Multigenerational Living."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cases, generations are squeezing under one roof, sometimes by building extensions. With a growing number of communities modifying zoning laws to permit second units, more people are adding separate guest cottages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By living together, families say they are better able to meet one another's needs for child and elder care. Moreover, money saved on rent can help finance a graduate degree, a job search or a down payment on a house, or offset the costs of long-term care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, such arrangements also pose challenges. Families say it is important to gauge compatibility carefully and set ground rules to ensure privacy and fairness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We call before we come over," says Marti Monroe, 69 years old. In 2005, Ms. Monroe and her husband, Dane Steck, 64, financed the construction of a one-bedroom home on the seven-acre property her son and daughter-in-law, Mike and Jody Malterre, own in Eagle, Idaho. The Malterres and their two daughters live in an adjacent 4,200-square-foot home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With full-time jobs, the Malterres "don't have a lot of time," says Ms. Monroe, a part-time educator. So she and her husband pitch in by ferrying their grandchildren to activities and tending to the property's vegetable garden and fruit trees, among other things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before setting up an extended household, advisers say a family should devise a financial plan that works for all parties. Often, a simple written agreement is enough, says Peter Canniff, a Nashua, N.H., financial planner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who prefer a temporary arrangement should "work out an exit strategy" -- for example, by estimating how long it will take a person experiencing financial problems to regain his or her footing, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cases, Mr. Canniff adds, it is a good idea to charge rent. "When kids end up back at home, it can hold back the parents' ability to save for their own retirement," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some "landlords" simply aim to cover the extra expenses they incur. In that case, they owe no taxes on the payments they receive, says Jeffrey Bloom, an elder-law attorney in Boston. Some even return the rent as a gift when a relative moves out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When generations join forces to purchase or modify a property, each should retain an adviser to review the tax and estate-planning consequences and protect their investment in the event the union dissolves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most obvious solution -- joint ownership -- can cause estate-planning headaches, says financial planner Paul Royal. In 2005, Mr. Royal, 48, and his wife Bonnie, 39, purchased an Exeter, N.H., home with a basement apartment for his parents. (Mr. Royal's father has since died.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the home was a stretch for the younger Royals, they decided against joint ownership, as the elder Royals' estate plan calls for their assets to be distributed equally among their three children. "We'd have a limited amount of time to sell the house and put the assets into the estate so they could be divided up," Mr. Royal says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joint ownership also can pose problems for those who may need to rely on Medicaid to cover future nursing-home costs, says Mr. Canniff. Applicants must show that they have limited assets, and gifts to family members can delay eligibility for benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, the Royals financed their home with a mortgage and a second loan from Mr. Royal's parents. As a lender, Lois Royal, 82, holds a lien on the property. Mr. Royal says he is able to cover his monthly interest-only payment on the family loan with the rent he charges his mother.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To generate cash to cover the principal -- which will come due on his mother's death -- Mr. Royal refinanced his mortgage. Under the terms of the family loan, he adds, his mother has the right to forgive all or a portion of the obligation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some families structure loans from elders so the remaining debt is canceled upon a parent's death, says Mr. Bloom. Yet another alternative: a so-called life estate. Under such an arrangement, a parent exchanges a lump sum for the right to live in a home until death, when the parent's interest in the property evaporates. But if the home is sold while the parent is still alive, the life estate provides some protection in the form of a share of the home's proceeds.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estate located five minutes from the Las Vegas strip has seen its price cut by a third.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most recently listed for $37.5 million, the estate was reportedly built for Prince Jefri Bolkiah of Brunei. It includes a main house with multiple master suites, a sushi bar and a discotheque.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property has more than 73,000 square feet of living space spread across eight buildings. The grounds include an equestrian center, polo track and an 11-car garage with a chauffeur's apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home is owned by Eric Petersen, a real estate investor who was president of Consumer Credit Services, Inc., a company that ceased operations and filed for bankruptcy protection last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Peterson paid $14 million for the property in 2004 and says he spent roughly $20 million completing construction but has never lived in the home. He said he no longer likes Las Vegas and plans to move to Beverly Hills, where he currently lives part time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zar Zanganeh of Luxe Estates Collection has the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Henri Wedell, a private investor, has put his 70,000-acre ranch in Argentina's Patagonia region on the market for $16.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wedell bought the property 12 years ago when searching for an adventurous vacation spot. It's bordered by miles of trout-fishing rivers and offers horseback riding opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estancia Los Remolinos is made up of a main, 58,000-acre lot that has the ranch headquarters, and a 12,000-acre lot that's located about 10 air miles northwest. Structures include a two-bedroom owner's house and staff quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wedell, who recently purchased a property in Colorado, says he and his wife, Marsha, are selling because the ranch is a better fit for younger owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ranch is being offered turnkey and comes with horses and 2,000 Hereford cows. Trent Jones of Hall &amp; Hall has the listing.</p>

</div><div class="author">By S. Mitra Kalita   </div><div>718 words</div><div>30 March 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices across the U.S. continued falling in January, raising fears of a double dip in the home-buying market and a longer slog toward recovery than once expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average sale prices of single-family homes in 20 major metropolitan areas fell 3.1% from a year ago, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price index released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"January brings us weakening home prices with no real hope in sight for the near future," said David M. Blitzer, chairman of the Index Committee at rating firm <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>. "The housing-market recession is not yet over, and none of the statistics are indicating any form of sustained recovery.…At worst, the feared double-dip recession may be materializing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only two cities—San Diego and Washington—recorded price increases year over year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The declines in the price index, which only gauges homes that have been sold before and excludes new construction, set a tone for a spring market with buyers firmly in control. The silver lining, economists said, is that affordability and low rates might spur more activity this spring than last year, which relied on a federal tax credit to stimulate demand. The average rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage inched up last week to 4.81%; a year ago, it was 4.99%, according to mortgage firm <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales—those with purchase contracts signed—increased 2.1% last month, with some regions showing more strength than others, the National Association of Realtors reported this week. Mortgage applications also have been on the rise for much of March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After more than 30 years of renting, Karen and Bernie Donovan have saved $16,500 and hope to buy a home in Florida soon. Because her husband's employment as an iron worker is erratic—he is currently looking for work—and she works part time at a T-shirt company and is trying to start a popcorn business, Mrs. Donovan doubts they would qualify for a conventional loan, despite the down payment they can make. They plan to cash out of some investments to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's our time now," Ms. Donovan said. "We want to find the deal of a lifetime."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers, meanwhile, are finding they must lower prices to meet buyers' expectations and compete with distressed sales, which represent more than a third of all transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For nearly a year, Jessica Strabley of Atlanta has been trying to sell her two-bedroom condominium. Only two prospective buyers have toured the unit, which she bought in August 2008 for $179,000. Last month, she cut the price for a fourth time to $175,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it's a great time to buy if you're in the position to buy," said Ms. Strabley, 31 years old, who works in telecommunications. "If you're trying to sell, it's not a good position to be in. Everyone that I know has pretty much either decided not to sell because they can't take the loss or they've ended up taking a loss."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the index, Atlanta-area prices fell 7% in January compared with last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, regulators proposed new mortgage-lending rules on Tuesday that could raise borrowing costs or limit access to loans for home buyers who can't qualify for a loan or insurance from government-backed firms and federal agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, those government entities are boosting fees that they charge borrowers to protect against the risk of future defaults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're really nailing consumers with higher fees," said Anthony Sanders, a real-estate finance professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. "From a fiscal-soundness perspective, that makes sense, but it's not another good piece of news for trying to revive the housing market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such pressures—and a still-shaky labor market—affect buyers' psychology and confidence in real estate and the overall economy, Mr. Sanders said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices are low, rates have been low. We have set up what in normal times would be a housing boom," he said. "Well, we already went through the boom."</p>

</div><div class="author">By William Boston   </div><div>786 words</div><div>30 March 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>22</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Frankfurt office-building values are still 20% below 2007 peak levels and vacancy rates continue to exceed 15%. But you would never know that from the amount of investment and development activity beginning to take place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany's financial capital has seen two major deals in the past four months, with <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>.'s J.P. Morgan Asset Management buying the OpernTurm tower and <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span> announcing plans to sell its Frankfurt headquarters to DWS Investments, an arm of the bank's asset-management division.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, three major properties are on the block, including Silberturm, the former headquarters of <span class="companylink">Dresdner Bank</span>, which has been put up for sale by <span class="companylink">Commerzbank AG</span>. And a venture of developer Tishman Speyer and Commerz Real AG is moving ahead with plans for a 40-story office tower, one of the few speculative projects in Europe at a time of economic upheaval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is some risk," says Michael Spies, head of European business for Tishman Speyer, which also was the seller of the OpernTurm building. "But if you are too confident, then you are probably too late."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The activity is a sign that the office market is firming despite uncertainty about the Middle East and the Continent's sovereign-debt crisis, although conditions remain far from the heady days of the early 1990s, when Frankfurt was known as "Mainhatten."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Commerzbank</span> originally planned to unload Silberturm, which means Silver Tower, in the wake of its acquisition of <span class="companylink">Dresdner Bank</span> in 2009. It put the sale on hold as global markets froze during the financial crisis, but now experts say the tower could fetch about 400 million euros ($564 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Tishman Speyer's development plans reflect the belief by some that, despite the high vacancy rate overall, demand will be strong for high-quality space. "There is a high proportion of vacancy in Frankfurt, but there are also a lot of old buildings," Mr. Spies points out. "The market is looking for very good buildings with very good space."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market is still a long way from the golden age of Frankfurt office properties at the end of the 1990s, when a new corporate skyline was emerging and the city on the banks of the river Main won the name "Mainhatten."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend was enhanced by the growth of Deutsche Borse, which became a global leader in derivatives trading, and the location of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt with the creation of the euro. At the peak of demand, top office rents hit more than 50 euros per square meter, compared with about 36 euros now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Frankfurt's office market never fully recovered from the global economic downturn after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. From the peak in 2001, Frankfurt prime office values fell 43% until bottoming out in mid 2005, according to an index prepared by <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. Frankfurt prime office values rose again from that trough, but even at the top of the last property boom, Frankfurt office valuations were still 21% below 2001 levels. At the beginning of this year, they were 37% below the 2001 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given these cross currents, real-estate professionals are watching the three pending sales for signs of whether values are rising again. They say the sale of <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>'s headquarters -- for a price of roughly 600 million euros, or about $846 million -- is difficult to analyze because the deal wasn't done at arm's length.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Commerzbank</span> is trying to decide whether to follow <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>'s lead and sell Silberturm to one of its own funds or to put it up for sale in the open market, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another possible deal, an investment fund operated by <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> is marketing the Trianon tower in Frankfurt's banking district. As it liquidates its P2 Value fund, a German open-ended property fund that ran into liquidity troubles two years ago, Morgan Stanley Real Estate GmbH has put all of the fund's assets up for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley Real Estate</span> didn't return calls seeking comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another office building that is on the market is the Westend Gate building, which houses the Marriott Hotel near the Frankfurt trade-fair grounds. The building is owned by the <span class="companylink">Aberdeen Asset Management</span>'s Degi Europa open-ended property fund. According to the fund's 2010 annual report, the value of the 47-story building was 193.8 million euros at the end of 2010, down from 242.9 million euros at its previous valuation.</p>

</div><div class="author">By S. Mitra Kalita </div><div>712 words</div><div>30 March 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices across the U.S. continued falling in January, raising fears of a double dip in the home-buying market and a longer slog toward recovery than once expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average sale prices of single-family homes in 20 major metropolitan areas fell 3.1% from a year ago, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price index released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"January brings us weakening home prices with no real hope in sight for the near future," said David M. Blitzer, chairman of the Index Committee at rating firm <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>. "The housing-market recession is not yet over, and none of the statistics are indicating any form of sustained recovery. . . . At worst, the feared double-dip recession may be materializing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only two cities -- San Diego and Washington -- recorded price increases year over year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drops in the price index, which only gauges homes that have been sold before and excludes new construction, set a tone for a spring market with buyers firmly in control. The silver lining, economists said, is that affordability and low rates might spur more activity this spring than last year, which relied on a federal tax credit to stimulate demand. The average rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage inched up last week to 4.81%; a year ago, it was 4.99%, according to mortgage firm <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales -- those with purchase contracts signed -- increased 2.1% last month, with some regions showing more strength than others, the National Association of Realtors reported this week. Mortgage applications also have been on the rise for much of March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After more than 30 years of renting, Karen and Bernie Donovan have saved $16,500 and hope to buy a home in Florida soon. Because her husband's employment as an iron worker is erratic -- he is currently looking for work -- and she works part time at a T-shirt company and is trying to start a popcorn business, Mrs. Donovan doubts they would qualify for a conventional loan, despite the down payment they can make. They plan to cash out of some investments to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's our time now," Ms. Donovan said. "We want to find the deal of a lifetime."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers, meanwhile, are finding they must lower prices to meet buyers' expectations and compete with distressed sales, which represent more than a third of all transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For nearly a year, Jessica Strabley of Atlanta has been trying to sell her two-bedroom condominium. Only two prospective buyers have toured the unit, which she bought in August 2008 for $179,000. Last month, she cut the price for a fourth time to $175,000. "I think it's a great time to buy if you're in the position to buy," said Ms. Strabley, 31 years old, who works in telecommunications. "If you're trying to sell, it's not a good position to be in. Everyone that I know has pretty much either decided not to sell because they can't take the loss or they've ended up taking a loss."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, regulators proposed new mortgage-lending rules on Tuesday that could raise borrowing costs or limit access to loans for home buyers who can't qualify for a loan or insurance from government-backed firms and federal agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, those government entities are boosting fees that they charge borrowers to protect against the risk of future defaults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're really nailing consumers with higher fees," said Anthony Sanders, a real-estate finance professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. "From a fiscal-soundness perspective, that makes sense, but it's not another good piece of news for trying to revive the housing market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such pressures -- and a still-shaky labor market -- affect buyers' psychology and confidence in real estate and the overall economy, Mr. Sanders said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices are low, rates have been low. We have set up what in normal times would be a housing boom," he said. "Well, we already went through the boom."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. swung to a surprise fiscal first-quarter profit as the company benefited from earnings at its Rialto Capital business and a legal settlement, but declines continued at its home-building business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has continued to weaken since the expiration of a federal tax credit for home buyers last year, hurt by a sluggish economy, high unemployment and tight lending standards. New-homes sales declined to near a 50-year low during February while sales of previously owned homes also slumped. Also Tuesday, the closely watched S&amp;P Case-Shiller indexes showed declining prices in January as the market slips closer to a double-dip decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Lennar has helped itself by looking outside of home building. Its Rialto Capital business, which invests in distressed real estate, has helped drive the Miami-based company's improved results in recent quarters. In February of 2010, Lennar said it partnered with the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. to purchase two loan portfolios with an unpaid balance topping $3 billion, providing a fresh income source through loan workouts. In the latest period,Rialto swung to the black and generated $11 million of operating earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While it is unclear whether the spring selling season will gain momentum or continue its sluggish recovery, we are confident that our company is well positioned for a profitable year in 2011," Chief Executive Stuart Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the quarter ended Feb. 28, Lennar reported a profit of $27.4 million, or 14 cents a share, from a prior-year loss of $6.5 million, or four cents a share. The latest period included a net $30 million in other income, primarily from a legal settlement. The prior year included an $11.6 million tax benefit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue decreased 2.9% to $558 million. Revenue from homes sales fell 11% as average sale prices and deliveries declined 7% and 4%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters forecast a loss of five cents on revenue of $508 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross margin on home sales rose to 20% from 19.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders fell 12% to 2,267 homes. The company's backlog, an indication of future business, also fell 12%. The cancellation rate was up at 17% from 13%. Incentives as a percentage of home sales eased to 12.1% from 12.5%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumer spending rose 0.7% in February, the largest increase since October and the eighth straight month of gains, easing some worries about the economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After adjusting for inflation -- factoring out such things as the jump in gas prices -- consumption rose 0.3%, the Commerce Department said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumers could have endured these higher [gasoline] prices by cutting back on discretionary purchases, but they did not," said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pickup in spending came as personal income rose by 0.3% last month, though higher prices sapped the gains. The saving rate, meanwhile, slid to 5.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress and the Obama administration in December agreed to extend income-tax cuts for Americans, and tax relief has fattened paychecks, providing consumers a cushion against rising gasoline prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite rising commodity prices, inflation at the consumer level is tame. A gauge closely watched by the Federal Reserve rose last month but only slightly, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The core price index for personal-consumption expenditures, which excludes food and energy prices because of their volatility, increased 0.9% on a year-over-year basis, after climbing 0.8% in January. The overall index rose 1.6% from a year earlier largely due to gasoline prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the National Association of Realtors on Monday said its index for pending sales of existing homes increased 2.1% to 90.8 in February from January. Sales were down 8.2% from their level in February 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade group's index tracks agreements to purchase previously owned homes. A sale is considered pending when the contract has been signed but the transaction hasn't closed. Pending sales typically close within one or two months of signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is trying to recover from its collapse after a long climb. Home sales soared during the boom, lifting prices, but began sliding in 2006, leading to the bursting of the bubble. Demand has been weak since.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recreational-vehicle maker <span class="companylink">Winnebago Industries Inc</span>. blamed gasoline prices as it watched sales fall in its second quarter.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite rising commodity prices, inflation at the consumer level is tame.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's property threat</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's property sector is a larger but less worrisome animal than its U.S. cousin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, investment in residential real estate accounted directly for 12% of China's gross domestic product, up from 10% in 2009 and a record. Throw in demand for construction material, and real estate's contribution is even larger. By contrast, the peak of spending on U.S. residential investment in 2005 was equal to just 6% of GDP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A larger role for real estate in the Chinese economy means the consequences of a bust should be more serious than in the U.S. And recent years offer a worrying precedent. A crackdown on speculation saw growth in real-estate investment fall from 31% a year at the end of 2007 to 3% at the beginning of 2009. The hit to construction spending, as much as the fall in exports, crunched China's GDP growth to 6.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first sight, history appears ready to repeat itself as prices run up sharply. The official house-price data tend to underestimate changes. But data from Soufun Holdings, which runs China's leading property website, show prices in cities like Beijing and Shanghai rising considerably faster than disposable incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, breakneck construction in 2009 and 2010 has created an overhang of supply -- including the ghost blocks of high-end residential apartments bought for speculative purposes that loom large in the bears' arguments. The government continues to clamp down on speculators. That double whammy will at some point bring the price surge to an end and take the wind out of real-estate developers' sails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when private investment fell away in 2008, there was nothing to take its place. This time around, the government plans a huge investment in affordable housing. The thin margins available in affordable construction are cold comfort for listed developers, but plans to build 10 million new budget residences in 2011 should to an extent cushion China's economy from a sharp slowdown in private-sector construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., housing is still weighed down by overbuilding in certain hot spots. In China, urbanization and rising wages mean construction is better underpinned by demand. Houses are generally paid for with cash, not credit. In the U.S., mortgage debt reached 103% of GDP in 2007. In China, long-term loans to households, a proxy for mortgage borrowing, are 16% of GDP. Even throwing in loans to real-estate developers and a share of loans to local government investment vehicles -- some of which are invested in property -- takes the total only to 50%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A slowdown in prices, if not a decline in some cities, is a distinct possibility. That will hurt developers. A correction will cause the banks pain and hit consumer spending. But it shouldn't signal economic disaster as it did in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Tom Orlik</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Catastrophe bonds</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">still have nine lives</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betting against Mother Nature is a risky business -- just ask catastrophe-bond investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cat bonds take losses in the event of severe natural disasters. Bonds valued at $1.7 billion could face losses following Japan's earthquake, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> estimates. But while that may make investors less willing to take on risk and boost yields in the short term, recent disasters may boost the $13 billion market in the long term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cat bonds were first issued in the mid 1990s as a capital-markets-based alternative to reinsurance. The bonds offer generous yields of 8.5% -- in line with high-yield corporate bonds -- to compensate for the risk that a big event wipes out the investment entirely. In fact, only a handful of cat bonds have taken catastrophe-linked losses to date, and losses linked to Japan are likely to be a small percentage of the $1.7 billion at risk, people familiar with the market believe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the market has been slow to develop. Reinsurance is typically cheaper and less capital-intensive than sponsoring a bond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, demand is forecast to rise. Global insured losses are increasing fast. Greater urbanization is concentrating natural-disaster risk, while rising insurance penetration in earthquake and typhoon zones brings new risk. Following recent disasters, Japanese, Chilean, and Australian insurers are likely to seek more catastrophe coverage. Mexico's government became the first to issue cat bonds in 2006; other countries could follow suit. Cat bonds could make up 4% to 5% of the total catastrophe-insurance market by 2015, from 1% at present, according to <span class="companylink">Munich Re</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">True, growth could be held back in the near term if investors start demanding higher returns, making cat bonds less attractive for issuers. But demand for cat bonds currently outstrips supply, bankers note. Investors -- predominantly specialist hedge funds but increasingly including traditional asset managers -- value them for their uncorrelated returns: Losses in financial markets don't spark seismic activity. The bulk of cat-bond issuance is linked to U.S. hurricane and earthquake risk at present, but greater coverage of Asian or Latin American risk should provide further diversification benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent disasters could yet see cat bonds land on their feet.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decline of BlackBerry</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">continues in slow motion</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should be evident by now that a corporate tragedy is under way at Research In Motion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manner in which the firm has now squandered the early technological lead and brand recognition it had inBlackBerry mobile-email devices is astonishing. Take its PlayBook tablet, unveiled six months ago but only going on sale next month, weeks after the second version of Apple's iPad hit store shelves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite being behind Apple, the first version of the PlayBook won't have cellular capability. Users will be able to use WiFi for Web access. But even then, users will need to connect the Playbook to their BlackBerry to read email delivered from BlackBerry servers. RIM is planning to add cell capabilityin future versions, which also couldcause some potential buyers to wait.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet this is the device that RIM co-CEO Jim Balsilliesays "may well be the most significant development for RIM" since the first BlackBerry was launched in 1999. Tellingly, Mr. Balsillie had started to say it "will be the most significant development" but corrected himself, perhaps realizing the hole he was digging himself into.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RIM doesn'tseem toexpect ablowout launch. Itprojects May quarter revenue to grow 24% to 33%, based on expectations of early PlayBook sales anda 21% to 29% increase in BlackBerry shipments. That guidance also reflects a change in the mix of handsets toward lower-priced devices like the Curve 8520. Worryingly, RIM made a similar statement a year ago about the 8520, nowa nearly two-year-old pre-3G device.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the company should be called Research In Slow Motion.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just when developer Steven Roth thought he had cleared his biggest hurdle for a planned new skyscraper on Central Park's southern edge, here comes Gary Barnett.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than five years, Mr. Roth's <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span> has been trying to clear out the renters in its 20-story apartment building at 220 Central Park South. The goal was to knock down the building and erect a soaring luxury condo tower with sweeping views of the park in its place. Vornado agreed in December to spend $40 million paying off the remaining apartment tenants, who are now moving out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Vornado has a final and unlikely holdout: Mr. Barnett, the rival developer and president of Extell Development Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years ago, Mr. Barnett bought the lease to the parking garage in the white-brick apartment building, according to people familiar with the situation. Mr. Barnett has thus far rebuffed the attempts of Mr. Roth to purchase the lease, the people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While talks continue between the parties, Extell's continued hold on that underground garage's lease would block, or greatly complicate, Vornado's attempts to demolish the 1950s building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barnett's strategy remains unclear. But holdouts often succeed in extracting big payments from developers eager to break ground. Mr. Barnett also owns an adjacent property and has expressed a desire to develop in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have the greatest respect for Vornado and its team of executives," Mr. Barnett said Sunday in a statement. "We hope to resolve any issues concerning these buildings in a mutually satisfactory manner."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Battles between developers and holdouts are common in the bare-knuckled culture of New York real estate, often tying projects up for years. The Durst family, for instance, waited more than three decades to buy out the last property owners for a site on 42nd Street and Sixth Avenue and develop the <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rarely, however, do the fights involve high-profile developers at opposite sides of the table. Vornado is one of the city's largest office landlords, built up over the past 30 years by Mr. Roth, a hard-charging negotiator. Mr. Barnett, a former diamond trader, is among the city's most active developers and is currently building a 75-story high-end hotel and apartment tower across from Carnegie Hall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vornado, along with development partner Clarett Group, bought the 124-unit building at 220 Central Park for $131 million in 2005. The developers planned a 41-story condo tower to rise in its place. Central Park is prime real estate, and new apartment buildings aren't built there very often. Vornado's latest quarterly regulatory filing put the development's cost at between $400 million and $425 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon after Vornado bought it, the project ran into resistance from rent-regulated tenants in the building. They sued in 2007, arguing that Vornado hadn't followed the law for removing them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The legal challenge dragged on until December 2010, when the remaining tenants settled. Vornado spread $40 million to buy out renters of 26 units, according to property records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barnett remains. His lease lasts about six more years, people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barnett's ownership of a neighboring lot on 58th Street could factor into negotiations. He has filed plans with the Department of Buildings for a permit to construct an 18-story apartment building there. That lot is sandwiched by another property owned by Vornado and Clarett, a small building at 229 West 58th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Barnett doesn't budge, Vornado might be able to still erect its building over the existing garage. But it would be much more expensive, if even possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This isn't the first time Mr. Barnett has butted heads with a heavyweight in New York City real estate. A decade ago, he unsuccessfully sued to block construction of the New York Times tower on 41st Street after the state tried to seize land owned by Mr. Barnett for the Forest City Ratner project. And in 2005, he made an unexpected bid to the M.T.A. in an attempt to offer an alternative to another Forest City project, the Atlantic Yards basketball arena and housing development in Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also isn't the first time the Columbus Circle neighborhood has seen a clash of the real estate titans. Last year, Stephen Ross, chairman of the Related Companies, made an unsuccessful hostile bid to foreclose on and demolish 1775 Broadway, a building a block away owned by large landlord Joseph Moinian.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's property sector is a larger but less worrisome animal than its U.S. cousin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, investment in residential real estate accounted directly for 12% of China's gross domestic product, up from 10% in 2009 and a record. Throw in demand for construction material, and real estate's contribution is even larger. By contrast, the peak of spending on U.S. residential investment in 2005 was equal to just 6% of GDP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A larger role for real estate in the Chinese economy means the consequences of a bust should be more serious than in the U.S. And recent years offer a worrying precedent. A crackdown on speculation saw growth in real-estate investment fall from 31% a year at the end of 2007 to 3% at the beginning of 2009. The hit to construction spending, as much as the fall in exports, crunched China's GDP growth to a decade low of 6.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first sight, history appears ready to repeat itself as prices run up sharply. The official house-price data tend to underestimate changes. But data from Soufun Holdings, which runs China's leading property website, show average prices in first-tier cities like Beijing and Shanghai rising considerably faster than disposable incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, breakneck construction in 2009 and 2010 has created an overhang of supply -- including the ghost blocks of high-end residential apartments bought for speculative purposes that loom large in the bears' arguments. The government continues to clamp down on speculators. That double whammy will at some point bring the price surge to an end and take the wind out of real-estate developers' sails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when private investment fell away in 2008, there was nothing to take its place. This time round, the government plans a huge investment in affordable housing. The thin margins available in affordable construction are cold comfort for listed developers, but plans to build 10 million new budget residences in 2011 should to an extent cushion China's economy from a sharp slowdown in private-sector construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., post-crash housing is still weighed down by overbuilding in certain hot spots. In China, urbanization and rising wages mean most construction is better underpinned by demand. And houses are generally paid for with cash, not credit. In the U.S., mortgage debt reached 103% of GDP in 2007. In China, long-term loans to households, a proxy for mortgage borrowing, is 16% of GDP. Even throwing in loans to real-estate developers and a share of loans to local government investment vehicles -- some of which are invested in property -- takes the total only to 50%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A slowdown in prices, if not an outright decline in some cities, is a distinct possibility. That will hurt private developers. A sharp enough correction will cause the banks pain and hit consumer confidence and spending. But it shouldn't signal economic disaster as it did in the U.S.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal income, hit hard by the recent recession, rebounded across the U.S. last year, but only 10 states saw individuals' earnings surpass their prerecession peaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data released Wednesday by the Commerce Department showed the uneven nature of the recovery. Incomes in Nevada, set back by the housing downturn and unemployment, gained just 0.3% in 2010 from a year earlier, while nearby New Mexico showed the strongest performance, with a 4.2% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal income in New York state picked up 4.1%, driven in part by a rebound in the financial-services sector. Regions benefiting from high commodity prices, such as Texas and Oklahoma, also were among the strongest gainers last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Texas and the states in the central part of the country that did not have the big housing boom and bust have been stronger through the recession," said James Diffley, an economist at IHS Global Insight. Meanwhile, states such as Arizona and Florida "are still very much in the depths of the problem caused by real estate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most industries showed earnings growth, only professional services -- among industries that declined in the recession -- recovered fully last year, with earnings hitting a level 0.2% above their prerecession peak.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell sharply in February, setting the stage for steep discounting in the spring market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors reported Monday that existing home sales dropped 9.6%, and the median price, $156,100, was the lowest since February 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The silver lining, say economists, is that bargain prices, coupled with low interest rates, might finally spur some buyers off the fence as the real-estate industry prepares for its busiest season. Even without the $8,000 federal tax credit that stoked sales last spring, industry watchers predict a larger number of transactions this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The job market is getting better and that will make people feel more confident about their income-earning prospects," said David Berson of the <span class="companylink">PMI Group</span>. "You need that confidence to buy a house. Household formations are also very important. ... Kids may have moved back in with their parents, or two people may have moved in together, because of job concerns. Now they can move into their own place."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Monday's data painted a picture of pain and price declines that have spared no region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market is still clearly years away from staging any meaningful recovery," Toronto-based Capital Economics wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">February sales data due Wednesday are expected to show that the market for new homes is just as lackluster as that for existing dwellings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some builders of new homes are increasing discounts on residences and boosting commissions to brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They don't do that if things are going well," said Alex Barron, a home-builder analyst with the Housing Research Center, an independent sell-side research firm. "The level of desperation in the builders is just going to increase substantially in the next two months, which is the heart of the spring selling season."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, February's weakness could have been driven by bad weather, deals canceled over lowball appraisals and a higher number of distress sales, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third of transactions were all-cash sales, and investors accounted for 19% of February sales activity, down from 23% in January. Low prices in many markets also reflect a new reality as sellers finally give in and reduce the asking prices on their homes in hopes of a fast deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"After three years of the housing downturn, people are becoming much more realistic in terms of valuing their homes," said Lawrence Yun, the National Association of Realtors' chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Atlanta's upscale Buckhead neighborhood, Natasha Swann put her family's five-bedroom colonial on the market about six weeks ago. The $1.6 million asking price won't recoup the roughly $200,000 that Ms. Swann spent on renovations such as finishing the basement and adding a bedroom. Still, the 41-year-old mother of three is eager to sell because she is building a bigger house nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After six showings, she is optimistic the home is priced competitively. "We had to be kind of aggressive" about making the price attractive, she says. "We don't know where the market's going, and I'm not going to wait a long time in an uncertain market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the number of distressed sales will continue to rise, and put pressure on prices. But mortgage rates, which were trending upward during the fall and winter months, have been falling in recent weeks amid global turmoil over the crises in Japan. Rates for 30-year loans were well below 5% last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Few think mortgage rates are going lower," said <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi. "It's more likely they will be 6% than 4% next spring. This lights a fire under buyers."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Tatyana Shumsky   </div><div>456 words</div><div>21 March 2011</div><div>14:34</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK—Comex copper futures finished lower on weaker-than-expected U.S. existing-home sales and softer refined copper imports to China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thinly traded March delivery contract settled down 1.3%, or 5.4 cents, at $4.2755 per pound on the Comex division of the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>. The most actively traded contact, for May delivery, was down 1.2%, or 5.3 cents, at $4.2860 per pound .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">February U.S. existing home sales fell 9.6% to 4.88 million, while prices sank to the lowest level in nearly nine years. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires forecast home sales to fall 3.9% to 5.15 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Protracted weakness in existing home sales has created a glut in real-estate inventories, which tends to delay new construction. Residential construction is a major end-user of copper for electrical wiring and plumbing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Copper prices began moving lower ahead of the data as some traders moved to cash in recent gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some people are just taking money off the table," said Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist with <span class="companylink">Lind-Waldock</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak imports of refined copper to China also pressured prices Monday. The world's top consumer of the metal imported 28% less refined copper in February compared to the same time last year, the General Administration of Customs said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"China has been very vocal about slowing down their economy, our economy is still anemic and the demand outlook is still pretty weak," said Larry Young, president of Covenant Trading LLC. "Most traders are expecting the market to come down to $4.10 because most people still have a negative bias on copper."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Copper traders are also watching the wider geopolitical picture, with attention focusing on allied air strikes launched in Libya over the weekend. The United Nations Security Council on Thursday authorized the use of "all necessary means" to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya and protect civilians from Col. Moammar Gadhafi's forces. The Middle East country has been grappling with civil unrest for almost two months as anti-government protests unraveled into armed conflict with pro-Gadhafi security forces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Copper prices had come under pressure as the conflict disrupted Libya's oil exports, driving oil prices higher and slowing economic growth. Crude oil was recently up 1.2% at $103.06 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Japan continues to grapple with an unstable nuclear facility. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex was damaged by the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami earlier this month. Since then authorities have been fighting to gain control of the facility, with limited progress.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Angus Loten   </div><div>1153 words</div><div>21 March 2011</div><div>10:32</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years after retiring as a PETCO executive, Stephen Gartner sat on the stoop of his new home in Tennessee, bored with the prospect of yet another round of golf. He decided he needed a second career -- and a haircut. Surely a trim was the easier proposition, but where? Gartner hadn't seen a Great Clips outlet – his salon of choice during his corporate days in Chicago – within a hundred miles of their new home. He had never considered running a franchise before, let alone a hair salon, but felt he had stumbled onto something and decided to look into it. What he found was a second life as a franchisee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From hair salons to real estate firms, fast food chains and interior decorators, franchisors are reporting a surge in the percentage of older owners in recent years – at Great Clips alone, the number of owners over 50 increased by more than 15% last year. Today's 50-plus Americans are wealthier, healthier and more active than ever before, experts say. They also have better credit and are more qualified to run a business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a number of reasons to choose any particular franchise, including the opportunity to turn a lifelong interest like wine into a Vino 100 operation, for example. Not the case with Gartner, who looked first at the bottom line. "This was a business with record quarter-after-quarter growth, even during a recession," Gartner says about Great Clips, a Minneapolis-based chain with over 2,400 outlets across the U.S. and Canada. Despite the recession, the company recorded more than a dozen consecutive quarters of customer growth, prompting Franchise Times magazine to rank it among the nation's top 100 business franchises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each salon costs between $100,000 and $200,000 to launch, depending on location, including everything from franchise fees, real estate and marketing costs to bulk shipments of shampoo and conditioner. As such, Great Clips requires potential franchisees to have at least $50,000 in liquid funds available and a personal net worth of $300,000 or more, says Rob Goggins, vice president of franchise development at Great Clips.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, franchises are not risk-free. While they have a better success rate than startups, up to 20% if franchises struggle to stay afloat, according to SCORE, a national small-business coaching network. That risk is even greater for older franchisees, says SCORE district director William Morland: "If you buy a franchise at age 25 and it doesn't work, you can go get a job and save up some more money to try again. The reality is another job, or the time to save more money, is probably not available to an older person," Morland says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On top of a hefty investment in a location, owners usually pay an upfront fee as high as 25% to the franchisor. They're also charged ongoing royalties, typically from 5% to 9% of sales. Even if business is slow, the franchisor's corporate playbook sets the rules for branding and product lines, leaving new owners little room to maneuver. And for all their business-in-a-box appeal, franchises, like all businesses, require a big time commitment: 14-hour days are common, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gartner was used to long hours. Decades of overseeing distribution, warehousing and global supply chains for large corporations gave Gartner the analytical skills to tackle the finances, operations and real estate side of the business. "The salon business is very cash-oriented. You don't have a lot of receivables, so it's not that tough to manage," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, Gartner opened a $500,000 line of credit with a local bank – far more than they needed he says, but providing a nice cash cushion. In March, the couple paid $145,000 to launch their first salon, in the Shoppers at West Market mall in Johnson City, plus a one-time franchise location fee of $20,000. Because Great Clips was unknown in the area, they spent most of the upfront investment on advertising and marketing. "We came into a market that was unfamiliar with the brand. We had to get it out there," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, managing a team of hairdressers and stylists turned out to be not so different from dealing with forklift operators, truck drivers and other warehouse personnel: "One is lifting boxes and the other's doing hair. But my job is all about how to motivate people to work well on an hourly basis, and that's very similar," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second salon followed in October 2010, and Gartner says he's currently working on opening a third. "We're really in the process of growing now," he says. "We're having fun. I can tell you our dinner conversations are very different than what they used to be."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gartner is also happier on the golf course these days – when he has time to play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gartner's Lessons Learned</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be open to opportunities. Gartner never would have predicted a career in logistics would have made him a good fit for Great Clips. But with a little bit of research, he realized the two weren't so different. "Make sure what you're looking at is right for you and you know what you're getting into," he says. Gartner researched the hair products and services industry with the same eye to detail he used in monitoring the comings and goings of millions of pet food and accessories packages at PETCO.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Understand your capital. There's a big difference between working within the budget of a large corporate subdivision and making sure you have cash to make payroll. "You want to be sure you have enough to break-even first and then to finance your projected growth," says Bill Morland, a SCORE district director based in Orange County, Calif. Morland says the most important document for any new business is a cash flow statement, which should be checked weekly. "You can be making a profit, but if you're not managing your cash you can 'succeed' yourself out of business," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You don't have to start from scratch. Buying a franchise gave Gartner a head start, with an already-developed concept and brand. Great Clips also offers several days of online and face-to-face training in salon management training, says Goggins. That said, bringing a franchise into a new market is more like launching a startup, he adds. "The advantage is you've got the pick of the market in terms of real estate and an untapped base, but you're also working from the ground up."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously occupied homes in the U.S. sank by 9.6% in February and prices fell to the lowest level in nearly nine years, indications that the market remains depressed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales decreased from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.88 million, the lowest level since November, the National Association of Realtors said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results were worse than forecast. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected home sales to decline by 3.9% to an annual rate of 5.15 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results called into question whether the U.S. housing market is recovering or falling further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have an uneven, choppy recovery," said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. "Hopefully it is a recovery that is taking place."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the rest of the U.S. economy has been gathering steam, the housing market's troubles are persisting. Last year was the worst year for sales of previously occupied homes since 1997, with about 4.9 million homes sold, according to the Realtors group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price for an existing home fell to $156,100, the lowest level since April 2002. That's down 5.2% from the year-ago median price of $164,600 and down from the median of $157,900 in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of previously owned homes listed for sale rose 3.5% at the end of February to 3.49 million available for sale. That represented a 8.6-month supply at the current sales pace, compared with a revised 7.5-month supply in January. Inventories are likely to rise in the coming months as more homeowners list their homes during the spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those homeowners are competing with a large inventory of foreclosures and other distressed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed properties including foreclosures and short sales -- ones in which the lender agrees to sell a property for less than the total mortgage amount -- accounted for about 39% of sales in February, the highest level in nearly two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 3.6 million homes are likely to be lost to a foreclosure or distressed sale by 2013, on top of 6.7 million since 2006, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. That large "shadow inventory" of unlisted bank-owned homes and potential foreclosures mean that inventories are likely to remain high and prices could take even longer to stabilize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Partly as a result, home prices fell to new lows in 11 major U.S. cities in December, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case Shiller home price index released last month. That index, a widely tracked measurement of home prices, has declined for five consecutive months, almost erasing gains since the recession ended in June 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors group also said Monday that January's sales rate was revised upward to 5.40 million from an initial estimate of 5.36 million. Compared with the same month a year ago, home resales were down 2.8% in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors report said home sales fell last month compared with a month earlier in all four regions. Sales fell 12.2% in the Midwest and 10.2% in the South. Sales fell 8.0% in the West and 7.2% Northeast. With demand weak, builders have kept construction low. Home construction in the U.S. took the steepest monthly plunge in nearly 27 years in February and new building permits set a record low, the Commerce Department said last week.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a move to lower their tax bills and boost their bottom lines, many of Westchester County's largest commercial-property owners are challenging municipalities' property assessments. That's creating an additional strain on financially strapped towns and villages in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A battle erupted last month in the town of Rye when the Doral Arrowwood Hotel and Conference Center in Rye Brook, N.Y., challenged four years of the town's assessments on its 114-acre property. If the hotel wins its appeal, the school district, the village of Rye Brook and the town could be forced to reimburse millions of dollars to the hotel. Doral has been hit with nearly $11 million in property taxes over the past four years, including about $2.7 million last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hotel's case is one of about 250 assessment appeals—the process is known as tax certiorari—the town of Rye says it has seen this year, and one of thousands across Westchester County. Municipalities say the distressed economy and real estate market has led to a sharp increase in appeals this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What corporations are doing to our local communities and schools is absolutely heinous and outrageous," says Rye Town Supervisor Joe Carvin, who is also a hedge-fund manager with <span class="companylink">Altima Partners</span> in New York City. "Commercial property owners are gaming the system."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property owners in Westchester say they are merely trying to pay their fair share in taxes, but not more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every taxpayer has the right to a fair and equitable assessment and that is all we are seeking," says Doral's lawyer David Wilkes, who specializes in tax certiorari cases. "Over the last couple of years the net income of these types of facilities has been declining quite a bit, and the market for this property has dipped in a significant way."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast to national office vacancies, which began to flatten in the latter half of 2010, the vacancy rate in Westchester's main commercial corridors, have continued to rise to nearly 20%, says Victor Calanog, director of research at real estate data firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A bigger share of distress from the last recession was shouldered by suburban markets relative to central business districts—Westchester typifies this overall trend," Mr. Calanog says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, large office parks have lined Westchester's Interstate 278 as large corporations such as <span class="companylink">MasterCard</span> and <span class="companylink">International Business Machines</span> relocated their employees from New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, as companies downsize and more employees eschew the suburbs in favor of living in New York City, many of these single-tenant office parks are emptying out. The financial crisis has hastened the trend, as companies like <span class="companylink">Bank of New York</span> and Citibank closed some of their Westchester locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The inventory is aging, and big corporations are downsizing," says William Cuddy, executive vice president at real-estate firm <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> and a resident of White Plains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While reassessing property values may mean savings for hard-hit businesses, the claims hit strained school districts and towns, which rely on commercial property taxes for a big chunk of their revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 2009 and 2010, the town of Harrison lost $5 million in assessed property values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's chipping at our tax base and the total value of Harrison, 30% of which is made up through commercial property," says Mark Heinbockel, Harrison's town assessor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, Rye's town assessor says the value of its assessed property went down about 9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assessed by the town at about $100 million, the Doral Arrowwood says its property is worth significantly less than that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a legal mechanism to assure the hotel doesn't leave any money on the table, the hotel claimed its property is worth 10% of the town's assessed value, according to Mr. Wilkes, Doral's lawyer. The town says it is forced to deny the hotel's "outrageous claim" and will head to court in June. It plans to hire an outside appraiser for between $30,000 and $50,000 to assess the hotel's value.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all real estate is in the dumps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing data due this week aren't likely to be encouraging. Figures Monday are expected to show sales of existing homes fell nearly 4% in February from January. On Tuesday, the government's index of home prices is forecast to register its seventh drop in eight months. And on Wednesday, economists anticipate new home sales in February will post a monthly increase of about 2% monthly increase, which will do little to dent January's nearly 13% decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Partly because of this, the rental market is heating up. Average U.S. apartment vacancy rates dropped to 6.6% last year from 8%, according to property-research firm Reis, while rents rose 2.3%. This has developers salivating over the potential for a multiyear rental boom. After all, the glut of foreclosed, single-family homes so far isn't proving much competition. Occupied apartments rose by about 58,000 in the fourth quarter, the biggest increase for that period in 10 years, according to Reis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is "very good to be in the apartment business today," David Neithercut, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span>, the biggest public U.S. real-estate investment trust, remarked at a recent conference. Population growth, a gradual firming of the labor market and a drop in the U.S. homeownership rate to 65% from its near-70% peak could generate about 4.5 million new renter households over the next five years, according to Greenstreet Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That level of demand "will far outstrip supply" through 2015, Greenstreet reckons, given the relatively low level of multifamily homebuilding in recent years. No wonder developers are itching to get in on the action. A multifamily production index from the National Association of Home Builders to track developer sentiment jumped to 40.8 in the fourth quarter, its highest reading since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not all wine and roses, though. Because real-estate construction is a relatively small part of the U.S. economy now and the single-family market remains depressed, the rental boom isn't likely to boost overall economic growth. And increased rental activity may increase inflation. Shelter accounts for nearly a third of the consumer-price index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The even bigger risk would be if the collapse of the single-family housing bubble led to the creation of one in rental properties.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Facing pressure from Democrats, Gov. Andrew Cuomo sought Thursday to connect an extension of the state's rent rules with the budget due at the end of the month, as well as a property tax cap favored by Senate Republicans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think they are relevant," he told reporters. "My preference would be to see them done in the budget."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democratic legislators earlier sent a letter urging Mr. Cuomo to include the extension in the budget, as they view expanding regulations for tenants as one of the few issues where they could gain ground in a year that many other priorities face the budget ax. They have also pushed for an extension of an income tax on high-earners, a concept the governor and Senate Republicans have resisted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rent laws sunset in June. The remarks were a rare broach of the topic by Mr. Cuomo, formerly the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He has not articulated specifics views on the issue other than to voice favor for extending the laws in some form.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In past years, their expiration has ignited battles in the Legislature, and Senate Republicans tried to eliminate the rules altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, discussion has been more sedate and has centered around an extension. The real estate industry and Senate Republicans, to which the industry is a major donor, have pushed for limited changes to the existing laws. The Real Estate Board of New York, which has been helping to fund advertisements backing the governor, is also pushing for an extension of a tax credit for developers and for legislation that addresses some recent court rulings that hurt landlords.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They need to be addressed and resolved," the board's president, Steven Spinola.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, real estate executives have been in discussions with Assembly Democrats on the issue, multiple people involved with talks said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central to the debate are rent stabilization rules, which limit rent increases on about 1 million apartments citywide. Under current law, landlords can deregulate vacant apartments when the rent hits $2,000 a month. Rent regulation advocates have pushed to abolish that provision and leave apartments regulated regardless of their rent, while the real estate industry would prefer to leave it at the current level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assemblyman Vito Lopez, chairman of the chamber's housing committee, said he thinks a deal could be reached, possibly this month, although the various camps are still far apart.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. wholesale prices soared in February due to a jump in food and energy costs as higher global commodity prices head toward consumers. Meanwhile, the home-building sector saw more turmoil as housing starts tumbled last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The producer price index rose a seasonally adjusted 1.6% in February from a month earlier, the Labor Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wholesale food prices alone surged 3.9%—the biggest upward spike since 1974—as harsh weather hit agricultural commodities and compounded existing supply problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About two-thirds of the jump in food prices came from fresh vegetables, a move that analysts attributed largely to poor harvests around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wholesale energy prices gained 3.3% during the month, due to higher crude-oil prices partly driven by turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While energy prices remain below summer 2008 levels, they are expected to continue increasing in coming months as supply problems make their way to consumers from producers. Consumer prices for food and energy are also expected to show sharp increases when the government releases the data Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But price increases remained minimal across other products. The "core" producer price index—which excludes food and energy—rose just 0.2% in February from a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With an unemployment rate that's still near 9%, there isn't going to be much domestically created inflationary pressure," said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. Despite price increases in a few areas, such as transportation, "core inflation is going to stay fairly muted."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High unemployment and relatively weak demand are also keeping key sectors such as housing depressed. Housing starts in February tumbled 22.5%—the sharpest decline in 27 years—to an annual pace of 479,000, the lowest since April 2009, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts for single-family homes fell nearly 12% while multifamily starts plunged 46%, reversing part of a sharp January gain in the traditionally volatile multifamily sector. Building permits, which indicate future construction, fell 8% during the month to an annual rate of 517,000, their lowest level since the data series began more than four decades ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest weakness suggests housing is unlikely to contribute much toward economic growth this year despite low interest rates and more affordable home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A high inventory of existing homes for sale, along with a wave of foreclosures hitting the market, are putting downward pressure on prices, leading some potential buyers to stay on the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The glut of supply means demand for new-home construction is likely to remain low for years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. wholesale prices surged last month on the back of higher energy and food prices, but underlying producer prices rose only moderately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, home construction in the U.S. took the steepest monthly plunge in nearly 27 years in February and new building permits set a record low, an indication that the battered sector is a key source of weakness for the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index of producer prices, which measures how much manufacturers and wholesalers pay for goods and materials, rose a seasonally adjusted 1.6% in February, the Labor Department said Wednesday. That's the biggest increase since June 2009. A 3.3% rise in energy prices and a 3.9% jump in food prices drove the greater-than-expected increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Core prices, which strip out volatile food and energy components and are considered a more reliable indicator of inflation, increased 0.2% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires were expecting a 0.6% increase in overall producer prices and a 0.2% increase in the core index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lower core level indicates that inflation pressures remain low. Year over year, the core index was up 1.8%, in line with the U.S. Federal Reserve's mandate of price stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After its policy-setting meeting Tuesday, the Fed said it would closely monitor inflation as it upgraded its assessment of the U.S. economy's recovery. Fed officials underlined that higher global oil prices are putting upward pressure on U.S. inflation, though they expect the impact to be temporary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S retailers and manufacturers have been reporting rising costs but have struggled to pass those on to consumers amid high unemployment, flat wages and cautious consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's data showed that energy prices rose for the fifth month in a row, driven largely by a 3.7% increase in gasoline prices. Food prices rose the most since November 1974.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect a report out Thursday to show consumer prices rose a monthly 0.5% in February, but underlying inflation likely rose 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of homes and apartments last month fell 22.5% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 479,000 from an upwardly revised 618,000 in January, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. It was the lowest level for housing starts since April 2009 and the largest monthly decline since March 1984.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, a gauge of future construction, fell 8.2% from a month earlier to an annual rate of 517,000. That was the lowest level in more than 40 years of record-keeping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The month's results were driven by a 46.1% decline in construction of multifamily homes with at least two units. Single-family homes, which made up about 78% of all starts, also fell, sinking by 11.8% from a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with the same month a year earlier, overall new-home construction was down 20.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are remaining idle due to weak demand from buyers, some of whom have become nervous amid reports showing U.S. home prices have turned downward once again. Many buyers are choosing foreclosures and other previously owned homes rather than new ones, which tend to be more expensive.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When City Place went on the block early last year in Fort Worth, the mixed-use complex looked like a tough sell, with all its retail space and one of its two office towers vacant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that was then, and this is now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While all that space remains empty today, a big change in the financing environment, particularly the rebirth of the commercial-mortgage-backed-securities market, has helped make a sale possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dallas developer Spire Realty Group has agreed to pay $74 million for the complex, which includes about 215,000 square feet of retail space and roughly 813,000 square feet of office space. The deal is the latest sign the resurgence in values that was first seen in top cities like New York City and Washington has begun to seep into secondary markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spire acquired the property for about $30 million in cash and financed the rest with a $44 million mortgage from <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> plans to repackage the loan in a larger pool of CMBS that will be sold to investors in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CMBS market, which fueled commercial real estate during the boom years, is rebounding after a near-death experience in the early years of the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. banks are expected to sell roughly $45 billion in loans as CMBS this year, up from $11 billion last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The opening up of the CMBS market is making deals like City Place possible. But at the same time, some analysts have raised concerns underwriting standards are beginning to loosen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's opportunistic capital for challenging deals now," said Wally Reid, senior managing director for Holliday Fenoglio Fowler, a real-estate-advisory firm that represented Spire in the financing negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"CMBS groups are fighting for deals," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spire, which signed a contract to acquire the property last summer, compared different CMBS financing options from <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span> and <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span>. Even a life-insurance company, in a sector that had sidestepped deals that carry complexity or risk for investors, was among the interested lenders, said Mr. Reid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Formerly the headquarters of <span class="companylink">RadioShack Corp</span>., City Place is near Fort Worth's popular Sundance Square area, which is packed with restaurants and shops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite its high vacancy, lenders were able to get comfortable with the City Place property because it also has a solid cash flow from its leased space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PNL Cos., the Dallas developer selling the property, redeveloped one of the towers and leased about 83% of the office space in the complex. Most of the office tenants are on long-term leases that don't expire before 2017, ensuring a steady annual net operating income of about $5.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a little more than twice the annual debt service of about $2.7 million on the CMBS. Partly because of this, <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> didn't view the five-year loan at a 5.75% interest rate as a departure from the conservative underwriting terms it has pursued in recent years, people familiar with the deal say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price Spire is paying is about $6 million more than the property would have gotten early last year, according to John Alvarado, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, who negotiated the sale for PNL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back then, a buyer would have gotten an initial 8.6% return, compared with the 7.9% yield Spire is getting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, prices have increased even more in top-tier cities, where yields in many deals have fallen below 6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there are still many limitations on lenders' largess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spire is gearing up to put about $17 million more of its own money to fund the construction of a parking garage and street-level retail on the site of the former mall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market's ever-changing, but it would be very difficult today to get a construction loan," said Jon Ruff, senior vice president at Spire. "We're prepared to take that hit."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plenty of people like the idea of owning a second home in Europe for regular, cultured vacations. Many stop fantasizing once they realize they'll also have a second mortgage on their hands. But what if that second property could make them money?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canny investors can put a second property to work on several conditions: They're willing to rent it out to short-term tenants for the times they aren't there, they can afford property in the $1 to $2 million range (€730,000 to €1.5 million) and, crucially, if they buy in the right locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime real estate broker Debbie Dove says there are two European hotspots offering short-term rental yields upwards of 5%: London and Cannes. Each city requires a different approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short-Term View</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">London is a transient rental market, with thousands of people passing through every year on business trips that can last for months on end. It's these folks, the ones who'd rather avoid the sky-high rates offered by London's hotels, who make good potential renters throughout the year. There's no peak season for short-term letting in London, so a buyer has the flexibility to decide when they want to stay for their own vacation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dove, who has built up an £80 million fortune and a property empire that includes the former homes of Robert Louis Stevenson and Charles Dickens, says the idea of short-term buy-to-let in what real estate agents call "prime London" is already popular with Middle Eastern property buyers, partly because the dinar has been strong against the pound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These buyers tend to stay in London during the summer and in the winter months of December and January. Much of the rest of the year - the autumn months of ramadam and then from January to June - they rent out the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It covers all their costs and they get a great profit," says Ms. Dove, adding that she has seen houses bought for £500,000 achieve £1,000 a week rent on short-let. A £2 million house in Knightsbridge could likewise achieve at least £4,000 a week on short-let, she says. "There's a very good demand of three to six months," she adds. "You can juggle owner occupancy around that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another scenario: You buy a one- or two-bedroom, small apartment in luxurious Belgravia. If you let it for two years without a break, the rent would average out at about £1,200 a week. But a three-month rental could achieve £2,000 a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If anything, London prime real estate offers investors the strong prospect of capital growth, meaning they could still achieve a yield of around 2%-3% from renting it over a long period of time. Jonathan Hewlett, a director at property broker Savills, has done just that. A couple of years ago he bought a studio flat in Central London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There will be capital growth and I think it's a safe place to put my money," he says, adding that capital growth prospects are similar to Manhattan, New York. That said: "London attracts a bigger global field of players so our market is going to be that much stronger."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are caveats to London. Stamp duty on British real estate is set to rise this April to 5% from 4%. Also, to capture juicy yields from short-term buy-to-let, buyers must fork out for the most top-notch property in some of the city's most exclusive areas. Ms. Dove typically brokers houses in Mayfair, Hampstead and Knightsbridge, which play host to some of the most expensive properties in Europe, much less the world. "There's no demand in London for anything that's not top notch," she says. "Everyone is looking for quality."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime locations are good, particularly properties that are attractive to look at, close to <span class="companylink">London Underground</span> stations and shops and not surrounded by too much noise. Avoid buildings that have high service charges, though.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One such example is the Lancasters, a prestigious, unfinished development of high-end apartments on Bayswater Road where prices range from £3.5 million to £8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimates from several estate agents are that the properties there could offer short-term rental yields of a relatively modest 3% because of high service costs--not attractive for someone who wants a stronger return on their investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yields? Cannes Can</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dove's second recommended hotspot is Cannes in Southern France. The area is a little more complicated for letting, but it offers sunny local weather for regular vacations while a stream of glittery events through the year make for a transient market that's perfect for short-term letting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Properties in and around Cannes can fetch eye-wateringly high rental income during the annual Cannes Film Festival, the Monaco Grand Prix and during the regular conferences like property trade fair MIPIM or MIDEM, the world's largest music industry trade fair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A three-bedroom apartment on the highly desirable Boulevard Croixette will set you back an initial £1.5 million, but bring in £7,000 a week in rent during the three weeks of the Cannes Film Festival, says Ms. Dove. The same goes for the Monaco Grand Prix, which takes place in Monaco but sees many of its participants stay in Cannes. The trick to achieving rental yields of 5% in Cannes is timing the letting of a property around the many events that take place nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prime period is the summer months of May, June, July and August, meaning you could leave the property vacant for your own holiday there in September, and rent it out again for the remaining months of the year at a lower rate. Winter months will achieve 50% of the very high rental rates of the summer. But even a year that's spotty with high yields is better than letting on a 12-month contract, says Ms. Dove.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property investors will find it almost impossible to find similarly-high yields from other parts of France where buyers might be tempted by the prospect of a cozy chateau or picturesque vineyard. The market for short-term letting of these properties is almost non-existent. "People take root in these properties," Ms. Dove explains. "It's a totally different market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there's the market for ski properties, including chalets and ski apartments in places like Switzerland. The problem here is that achieving any sort of decent yield requires properties with purchase prices in the €20 million range, well beyond the budgets of most property investors.

</div><div class="author">By Dawn Wotapka  </div><div>516 words</div><div>7 March 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A20</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment giant UDR Inc. is entering the Manhattan rental market with the $260.8 million purchase of a 23-story converted Financial District building that once housed <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UDR's purchase of 10 Hanover Square, expected to close within 60 days, comes as Manhattan rents are rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Manhattan's rents softened following the financial crisis, the market is improving as renters feel confident enough to sign leases. In many cases, concessions -- the freebies landlords throw in to attract tenants -- have disappeared. Year-over-year comparisons show prices up 8.01% on average, according to the Real Estate Group NY's February report. The average rent for a one-bedroom unit with a doorman was $3,560 in February, a gain of more than 10% from a year earlier. Two-bedroom units saw an 8.4% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denver-based UDR has been reshaping its portfolio with a focus on harder-to-enter markets with higher rents. By buying its first Manhattan property, the real-estate investment trust is entering one of the nation's strongest markets, where consumers typically rent well into their 30s. In the fourth quarter, New York's vacancy rate was 3.2%, below the national rate of 6.6%, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UDR says monthly revenue from the 493 units at Hanover Square average $3,000 each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UDR, which controls nearly 60,000 units in 13 states and Washington, D.C., is paying seller Witkoff Group $484,000 per unit. The site also includes 41,650 square feet of retail space with tenants including <span class="companylink">Apple Bank</span> and <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purchase price includes assuming a $192 million mortgage, the issuance of approximately $64.3 million of operating partnership units and about $4.5 million in cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investor demand for apartment buildings has been heating up throughout the country, partly because people who were closed out of the home-buying market have turned into renters. Demand for buildings is particularly acute in hot markets such as New York, where, in some cases, building prices have reached levels last seen in mid-2007</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other big public companies also have been increasing their interest in New York City apartment buildings. For example, Chicago-based <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span>, which entered the New York market in 2004, last year announced it was buying developer Harry Macklowe's last three Manhattan apartment buildings for $475 million. <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> also is working on development here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Real Estate Group NY report, the priciest one-bedrooms with a doorman were found in SoHo, while Harlem had the cheapest. The Financial District, an area hard hit from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, saw strong gains as it continues healing. In February, one-bedroom doorman units were an average $3,544, up nearly 12% from a year earlier, according to the report based on data taken from more than 10,000 listings below 155th Street and priced under $10,000.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown and Lingling Wei </div><div>843 words</div><div>2 March 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group</span> sold $163.5 million in mortgage-backed securities backed by a virtually empty former Superfund site in North Miami, Fla. Investors didn't even blink at the $475 million appraisal of the property's value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, city officials are moving to seize control of the 188-acre development site. The commercial mortgage-backed securities sold to investors are on track to become the second-biggest flop ever among such securities. Holders of the bonds likely will see little or no principal returned from the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Negotiations are ongoing, with the servicer overseeing the loan hoping to sell it to the city for $6.5 million. A lawyer for the servicer, Trimont Real Estate Advisors, said his client still could retrieve value, but declined to say how much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The development, named Biscayne Landing, is an unusually painful example of overly bullish underwriting used in some CMBS deals near the crest of the real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Miami's move to terminate the lease on the property as soon as this week, citing multiple missed debt payments, shows how much some bubble-era deals still are inflicting pain on investors and lenders. CMBS delinquencies reached a record of 9.39% in February, according to data set to be released Wednesday by Trepp LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the market for such securities is coming back to life, and with virtually the same structure that helped overheat the commercial real-estate market. Analysts estimate U.S. banks are expected to sell about $40 billion to $50 billion in loans as CMBS this year, up from about $11 billion in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said the commercial loans being made now are generally conservative compared with 2007. But loan standards have become less stringent in recent months. "Transaction structures are becoming more complex and underwriting standards are loosening somewhat," analysts at <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> wrote last week about new CMBS deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the boom, CMBS became one of the most popular forms of real-estate finance, with investment banks making loans and then packaging them as securities then sold to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By and large, such loans were backed by properties already generating cash flow that could be used to pay interest. By 2006 and 2007, though, the real-estate market was so frothy that banks began securitizing loans based on bets that rents or property values would rise. At Biscayne Landing, lenders took the unusual step of basing repayments on projections by developers of what they would eventually build and sell. "It's just a perfect example of what people were permitted to do back then," said Manus Clancy, managing director at Trepp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> effectively closed the unit that made the Biscayne Landing loan. Late last year, the Swiss bank restaffed the commercial mortgage-backed securities unit. Ben Aitkenhead, who leads the operation, said it would act "prudently," focusing on stable loans and avoiding risky ventures such as land loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two bankers who oversaw the <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> unit that made the Biscayne Landing loan, Anthony Orso and Michael Lehrman, now lead a similar operation at <span class="companylink">Cantor Fitzgerald</span>. The investment bank and brokerage firm was one of the first to form a new CMBS unit as the market rebounded. They declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Biscayne Landing's developer, South Florida-based Boca Developers, envisioned that the real-estate market would support 5,000 condominiums on the site, transforming it into a city within a city with a "Town Center" lined by townhouses and retail shops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property sits next to mangroves but is on a former landfill and federal Superfund site. The tract borders a sewage-treatment plant and a strip mall. Instead of owning the site, Boca signed a 200-year lease with North Miami, to which the company also pledged $10 million toward a new Olympic sports-training facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project won a $233 million loan in 2007 from <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>. Of that, $163.5 million was sold as commercial mortgage-backed securities. <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> sold $35 million of the debt to <span class="companylink">New York Life Insurance Co</span>. and held the rest. Investors expected to get their money back as Boca developed the project and paid down the land loan with separate construction loans for the condo towers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the bubble burst, no towers were built, real-estate values shriveled, and Boca agreed to turn over the project to lenders. The servicer overseeing the loan hasn't found a buyer, and the city is moving to terminate the lease this week, although talks are continuing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Street, co-founder of Boca, said the loan was underwritten with "conservative" standards, allowing for a modest drop in property values. Other lenders offered similar loan terms, and Boca didn't anticipate the lending market would collapse, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We saw this as a multibillion-dollar home run for us," he said. "No one could plan for the meltdown that we actually experienced."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not many New York City hotels are being put up for these days, as owners prefer to hold on a little longer in anticipation of an industry rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But properties that are going on the block are finding multiple cash-flush buyers angling to ride the market's recovery. The latest owner deciding to sell is French hotel operator <span class="companylink">Accor SA</span>, which has put its 480-room Hotel Novotel north of Times Square on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Accor</span>, which owns the Sofitel Luxury Hotels and Motel 6 brands, among others, aims to sell the Novotel, at 226 W. 52nd St., as part of its strategy to shed real estate and instead focus on managing and branding hotels. A buyer of the Times Square property will be required to keep <span class="companylink">Accor</span> as the hotel's long-term manager, an <span class="companylink">Accor</span> spokeswoman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Accor</span> has enlisted <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> Hotels to shop the midscale Novotel in a "very strategic, targeted marketing process," said Jeffrey Davis, executive vice president of the brokerage's hotel division.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Novotel's listing comes as operator <span class="companylink">InterContinental Hotels Group PLC</span> has said it intends to sell the 685-room InterContinental New York Barclay hotel near Times Square as part of its own strategy to pare its real-estate holdings. That company late last year opened another InterContinental -- at 300 W. 44th St. -- and intends to continue managing both hotels under the InterContinental brand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York hotel values fell 60% from their 2007 peak during the recession, according to HVS Global Hospitality Services. Since then, they have rebounded to within 10% to 15% of those peak values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, many owners are holding back. "If your objective is absolute dollar return, and it's not part of a bigger strategy [to divest], then you're probably not a seller today," says Mark Elliott, senior managing director of hotel brokerage Hodges Ward Elliott Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only two Manhattan hotels have sold so far this year, for a combined $600 million, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. That compares with 15 Manhattan hotels sold last year for a cumulative $1.6 billion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Treasurys rose on Monday, boosted by weak consumer-spending data plus supportive comments and buying from the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additional support came from some fund managers who bought securities to match the month-end adjustments of the benchmark bond indexes. Newly minted bonds replace matured debt in the indexes on the last trading session of a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three-year note was the best performer as the sector garnered the bulk of the $6.69 billion purchases from the Fed on Monday. The buying was part of the Fed's $600 billion Treasury bond-buying program launched in November as a second round of stimulus for the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We did have the Fed buying in the front end of the market. Also today you are seeing month-end buying bringing in buyers on any dip we have seen," said Jason Rogan, director of U.S. government trading in New York at <span class="companylink">Guggenheim Partners LLC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But flows are still very small," he said, as many investors brace for key U.S. data in coming days and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's testimony to lawmakers on the economic and rate outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke will deliver his semiannual monetary-policy testimony before the Senate on Tuesday and the House on Wednesday. The key U.S. report this week is the nonfarm-payrolls data due Friday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late afternoon, the benchmark 10-year note was 2/32 higher to yield 3.416%, the lowest yield since Jan. 31. The three-year note was 4/32 higher to yield 1.167%. The two-year note was 3/32 higher to yield 0.696%. The 30-year bond rose 12/32 to yield 4.492%. Bond prices move inversely to yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year note's yield, the benchmark for U.S. consumer and corporate borrowings, had tumbled from the nine-month peak of 3.77% set on Feb. 9 as geopolitical risks flared up. The rally over the past couple of weeks helped Treasurys recoup most of the monthly losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resilience in the bond market amid higher U.S. stocks signaled that some investors still are cautious on the political turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Any stability in the Middle East or the absence of greater demonstrations and violence will be considered a net negative for the bond market and particularly the long end," said Russ Certo, co-head of rate trading at <span class="companylink">Gleacher &amp; Co</span>., a boutique investment bank and bond dealer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumer spending rose by 0.2% in January, slower than the revised 0.5% increase a month ago, even as personal income rose at 1% in January, which was higher than 0.4% a month earlier.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</span> President William Dudley, who votes on monetary policy and is among policy makers advocating stimulus to boost the economy, continued to argue Monday that the economy -- which has improved considerably in recent months -- isn't strong enough to start withdrawing monetary stimulus.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude-oil prices have surged in recent days as many investors were worried that the antigovernment protests that have toppled the regimes in Egypt and Tunisia could spread to other nations in a region that is home to some of the world's biggest oil producers and exporters, including Saudi Arabia.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG -- <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. has relinquished its shares in Japanese real-estate firm Simplex Investment Advisors to private-equity firm Aetos Capital LLC, which is betting on a recovery in Tokyo property prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York-headquartered Aetos said it renegotiated Simplex's 150 billion yen ($1.8 billion) worth of debt, a lot of which had been short term, and put an extra 10 billion yen of capital into the firm from its second fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We believe the recovery of the Japanese real-estate market has been gathering momentum and anticipate more attractive investment opportunities in the future," said Scott Kelley, founder and head of real estate at Aetos Capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Goldman sold shares in Simplex to Aetos for a small fraction of its original investment, said people familiar with the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aetos and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> took Simplex private in October 2007 for $1.3 billion, plus the assumption of roughly $2.9 billion in debt, In 2007, Japanese land prices rose for the first time in 16 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks aggressively lent against Japanese property in 2006 and 2007, while global and domestic opportunistic funds competed to buy offices in the country. But the Japanese real-estate bubble popped when the financial crisis erupted in the U.S., and investment banks sharply curtailed new lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many real-estate loans taken out during the go-go years are maturing. In Japan, commercial-mortgage-backed securities loans are usually due in about three years, compared with five to seven years in Europe and about a decade in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of Simplex's property portfolio is office space, and 87% of the value is located in Tokyo, the most resilient part of the Japanese property market. Even so, since the buyout Simplex has had to sell about 120 billion yen worth of assets to help repay creditors, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After many bankruptcies in the Japanese property market, global investors are once again starting to put money to work in Japanese real estate, and bankers are extending capital and rolling over debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Lender relationships are critical," Mr. Kelley said in an interview. "Funds that were dabbling in the Japanese market have retreated."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp</span>. had the biggest exposure to the company and led the creditors in the negotiations with Aetos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that Aetos has sorted out Simplex's finances, its biggest deal to date, it can spend more time on looking for new deals. Founded in 1999, Aetos is looking to raise about $1 billion for its fourth real-estate fund, again focused on Japan and China, the person said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The worst is over," said Andy Hurfurt at real-estate consultancy <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> in Tokyo, who believes the high-end Tokyo office market has stabilized and vacancy rates are coming down.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of construction projects commenced in New York City rose 15% in 2010 thanks to non-residential and public sector building, while new residential construction starts continued to slide, according to the New York Building Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&nbsp;Work on new buildings with a total construction cost of $19.5 billion began last year.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the McGraw-Hill Construction Dodge data, analyzed by the New York Building Congress, non-residential construction starts were $13.02 billion in 2010, up from $9.7 billion in 2009 and $8.9 billion in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential projects worth $2.21 billion began last year, which was down from $6.03 billion in 2008, at the tail end of the construction boom, and $2.58 billion in 2009, according to the analysis.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Justin Lahart   </div><div>473 words</div><div>25 February 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for long-lasting manufactured goods rose in January, driven by a jump in aircraft sales, but orders for other items fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for durable goods -- items designed to last at least three years -- rose 2.7% to a seasonally adjusted $200.55 billion, the Commerce Department said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The driving force in the upturn was sales of commercial aircraft and parts, an area prone to wide swings in orders, which jumped to $7.4 billion from $148 million a month before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding aircraft and other transportation equipment, durable-goods orders slipped 3.6% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a key measure economists use to gauge business spending on new equipment -- nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft -- fell 6.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Durable-goods orders are often viewed as a gauge of the factory sector's health, and last month's drop in nonaircraft orders suggests a slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many economists believe those drops were driven in part by problems with how the Commerce Department adjusts the orders figures to account for normal seasonal swings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To look at the report, you'd think it was an F," said Michael Feroli, an economist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>. "If you take account for the distortions, it's a C-plus."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department separately reported that sales of new homes declined 12.6% in January from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 284,000. That was not far above the record low of 274,000 set last August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New homes have faced tough competition from the large number of homes that have been put on the block in the foreclosure process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported that the median price for a new home in January was $239,600.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While not strictly comparable, the median price for a previously owned home was $158,800, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders have cut their inventories sharply in response to the weak market.There were a seasonally adjusted 188,000 new homes on the market in January, the fewest since 1967. But at the current pace of sales, it would take 7.9 months to sell those homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since records started in 1963, home builders have had an average of 6.2 months' worth of supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said the number of new claims U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits fell by 22,000 to 391,000 in the week ended Feb. 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weekly claims figures have been choppy recently as a result of severe weather. But the four-week moving average of new claims, which tempers such volatility, fell by 16,500 to 402,000. That was the lowest level since July 2008, suggesting the job market may be gaining strength.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once considered the upper crust of Manhattan neighborhoods, the Upper East Side these days can often evoke "Animal House" as often as "Breakfast at Tiffany's."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Park and Madison avenues have retained their elite status and multi-million-dollar penthouses, the scene east of Lexington Avenue has been inundated with college graduates and young families looking for bigger spaces at more affordable prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Laura Coleman and her husband decided to buy a two-bedroom apartment in the Manhattan House -- a 600-unit building on 66th Street and Third Avenue that was converted into condominiums in 2008 -- she says she thought the historically "fancier part of the city would be reserved and snobby."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was surprised by how mixed the neighborhood actually is now," says Ms. Coleman, who has a 1-year-old son. Even so, the Colemans say the area still lacks trendy restaurants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the proximity to Central Park and the concentration of the city's top private schools and foreign consulates, the Upper East Side was once known as the "Silk Stocking District." Gracie Mansion, the only remaining villa overlooking the East River, became the home to New York's mayor in 1942 -- although Mayor Michael Bloomberg has chosen to live nearby on East 79th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It used to be if you were in your 20s you had to live below 23rd Street or don't live in New York at all," says Dan Marrello, senior managing director at real-estate brokerage firm Citi Habitats. "No one at that age wanted to live in the Upper East Side."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says at the height of the market in 2005 and 2006, "prices Downtown went through the roof and young people were priced out, so they started to flock uptown to the Upper East Side."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second and Third avenues gave way to bars, and restaurants that attracted recent college graduates. And new developments such as 515 E. 72nd, the Lucida, <span class="companylink">Georgica</span> and the Azure popped up, adding more housing units to the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with the rest of the city, prices in the Upper East Side began to slip during the recession. Median home prices in the area fell from $975,000 in 2008 to $850,000 at the end of last year, compared with $800,000 for Manhattan as a whole according to Property Shark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile construction on the long-planned Second Avenue subway line began in 2007, disrupting businesses, restaurants and long-time residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Metropolitan Transportation Authority estimates that the first of four phases of construction, which involves an extension of the Q line between 59th and 96th streets, will be completed by 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the completion of a full subway line that would run between Lower Manhattan and 125th Street along Second Avenue is likely still decades away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say buyers with a long-term view who are willing to put up with the construction in favor of the proximity of a subway line can benefit now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The inconvenience of it all and the unknown time frame definitely causes frustration but these apartments are priced to sell and when the subway is done residents will really be able to take advantage of it," says Gary Malin, president of Citi Habitats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bargains are even better for renters who can pay an average of between $1,600 and $2,200 for a studio or one-bedroom apartment in the area, according to a January rental report from Citi Habitats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Jen Johnson moved to New York from Dallas this month, she began looking for studios in the West Village and Murray Hill but quickly headed north to the Upper East Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was no way I could live alone in the West Village and Murray Hill for what I could afford and the apartments were just so little and so much more expensive," says Ms. Johnson, 26.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drawn to the plethora of happy-hour signs, yoga studios and coffee shops, Ms. Johnson signed a lease on an Upper East Side studio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I feel like it's a fun, hopping, young place to live," she says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for long-lasting manufactured goods rose in January, driven by a jump in aircraft sales, but orders for many other items fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for durable goods -- items designed to last at least three years -- rose 2.7% to a seasonally adjusted $200.55 billion, the Commerce Department said Thursday. But the driving force in the upturn was sales of commercial aircraft and parts, an area prone to wide swings in orders, which jumped to $7.4 billion from $148 million a month before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding aircraft and other transportation equipment, durable-goods orders slipped 3.6% last month. And a key measure economists use to gauge business spending on new equipment -- nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft -- fell an even larger 6.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Durable-goods orders are often viewed as gauge of the health of the U.S. factory sector and last month's drop in nonaircraft orders does suggest a slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many economists believe those drops were driven in part by problems with how the Commerce Department adjusts the orders figures to account for normal seasonal swings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To look at the report, you'd think it was an F," said Michael Feroli, an economist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>. "If you take account for the distortions, it's a C-plus."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department separately reported that sales of new homes fell 12.6% in January from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 284,000. That was not far above the record low of 274,000 set last August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New homes have faced tough competition from the large number of homes that have been put on the block in the foreclosure process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported that the median price for a new home in January was $239,600.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While not strictly comparable, the median price for a previously owned home was $158,800, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department reported that the number of new claims U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits fell by 22,000 to 391,000 in the week ended Feb. 19.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York area home prices have held up better than most other major metropolitan areas, with wealthy commuting suburbs providing the bulk of recovery while towns farther from the city have lagged, brokers and analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those mixed results came after a national survey this week found that December home prices in the New York metropolitan area hit their lowest level since 2004, according to the S&amp;P/Case Shiller Index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the more affluent towns in the tri-state area, last year's slowdown may already be passing. Brokers say confidence is returning after the stock market touched a post-financial crisis high and Wall Street bonuses poured in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason Wachtel, who runs a small but booming executive-search business, decided to take a $10,000 loss on a co-op in Great Neck on Long Island and is now in contract to buy a much larger house for nearly $1 million in nearby Lake Success, after he fell in love with the area, and found prices reasonable. "Also," he said, "business has been good to me."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Westchester County, the number of signed contracts in 2011 for homes priced at $1 million or more is up more than 25% compared with the same period in 2010, according to real-estate broker Houlihan Lawrence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for much of the rest of the area, the recovery has been more muted. "There appears to be a growing rift between the commuter towns and those further from the city," says Chris Meyers, Houlihan Lawrence's chief operating officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westchester home sales last year were up 20% over 2009, according to Houlihan Lawrence. But in Putnam County -- home to fewer Manhattan commuters and more dependent on the local economy -- sales were up only 5% in 2010; in even more distant Dutchess County, home sales declined for the fifth straight year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home price index showed New York area home prices falling 2.3% in December from the year-ago period. That dragged the region's home price index to its lowest level since March 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists say the price dips here and nationwide reflect a rising number of distressed sales, plus the end in April of a tax credit for home-buyers of up to $8,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index, which measures re-sales of single-family homes and excludes condos, co-ops, townhouses and new homes, doesn't catch most home sales in New York City. But it does capture the bulk of activity in the surrounding areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maureen Maitland, vice president of S&amp;P Indices, said the New York area's index annual decline was the sixth smallest of the nation's 20 largest metropolitan areas covered by the index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said New York home prices in December were still about 68% above price levels in 2000. It's one of just five metro areas with prices more than 50% above their 2000 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two factors largely influence home prices, Ms. Maitland said: the ability of the local economy to produce enough jobs and the number of homes on the market. Cities like Las Vegas and Phoenix suffered from a supply glut in a way that was less common in the New York area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Fairfield County, Conn., home to many finance professionals and other Manhattan commuters, sales showed signs of rebounding last year, albeit after a sluggish 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For eight towns in lower Fairfield County, combined sales were up 26% in 2010 over the previous year, though most prices remain subdued, said Gregory Heym, chief economist for Terra Holdings, parent company of brokers Halstead Property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The picture is cloudier in New Jersey. Jeffrey G. Otteau, an appraiser and president of the Otteau Valuation Group, found that median prices statewide rose 1% between 2009 and 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it rose by 5.7% in affluent towns like Glen Ridge, Chatham, Summit and Millburn that provide direct rail service to midtown Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median prices fell the most, 8.2%, in what he called "the Gold Coast" towns along the Hudson -- such as Jersey City, Hoboken and North Bergen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Long Island, brokers told a similar tale. A report released a few weeks ago by Prudential Douglas Elliman found that median prices were down in the last quarter by 5.6% compared with the previous quarter, but still up overall by 1.6% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mona Holzman, director of the Prudential Douglas Elliman office in Great Neck, said the market was busy but uneven, with some properties there were selling quickly for more than she expected, while others linger on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her main worry now, is that a further rise in interest rates could put a lid on prices, or even push them down further.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anton Troianovski </div><div>1070 words</div><div>23 February 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An influx of fresh capital into U.S. commercial real estate is bringing some long-stalled development projects back to life and launching new construction of apartments, office buildings and shopping centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moves show that the industry, in a deep slump just a year ago, has entered recovery mode -- at least in the nation's largest and healthiest markets. Analysts say the improved economy is giving rise to pockets of demand for new commercial space, while low yields on other investments prompt investors to seek higher returns in real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nascent turnaround comes even though many U.S. banks still are slogging through billions of dollars in bad commercial-real-estate loans, a big cause of bank failures. Still, some of the largest U.S. banks are tiptoeing back into commercial real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. financed as much construction lending in the first six weeks of 2011 as the nation's second-largest bank by assets did in all of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York company won't disclose construction-loan origination volume. "We have certainly started making construction loans again," Todd Maclin, head of <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>'s commercial bank, said in an interview. "In the third quarter and fourth quarter of last year, it started as a trickle, and now you're starting to see much more activity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Atlanta, development company OliverMcMillan said it has secured $300 million in private-equity funding to take control of and complete an unfinished, eight-acre development of shops, residential units and office space that has languished in the city's Buckhead section for two years. In Atlantic City, N.J., the developer of the half-built, 1,100-room Revel casino resort last week nailed down $1.15 billion in financing to complete the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug Linde, president of <span class="companylink">Boston Properties Inc</span>., said the office-building landlord is increasingly confident it will able to restart construction this year on a $1 billion Manhattan skyscraper. Work stopped in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Mr. Linde said the company might even go back to work on the 40-floor building without first signing up a major tenant, as banks, law firms and media companies dust off expansion plans to chase an expected scarcity of New York office space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the Census Bureau reported that new construction of apartment buildings jumped 80% in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 171,000 units, the highest rate since February 2009. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg unveiled plans earlier this month for, he said, the city's largest affordable-housing complex since the 1970s. Zaremba Group said Friday that the Cleveland developer has a $30 million deal to finish a 375-unit high-rise apartment complex in Tempe, Ariz., that has been stalled for more than two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the U.S. still is dotted with thousands of stalled construction sites, ranging from struggling apartment projects on the Brooklyn, N.Y., waterfront to shells of buildings in suburban Sacramento, Calif. And it will take years to replace more than two million construction jobs, or about 30% of the 2006 peak, lost since the real-estate bubble popped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Chicago, a 150-story skyscraper called the Chicago Spire and long planned to outstretch the 110-story Willis Tower as the city's tallest building, is a hole in the ground. Anglo Irish Bank Corp., the nationalized commercial-property lender at the center of Ireland's banking crisis, launched foreclosure proceedings against the Spire's developer last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But office buildings and other projects could help cushion the U.S. economy if public-sector building declines, as expected, due to government budget cuts and waning economic-stimulus aid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index of new-construction lending by hundreds of federally insured savings institutions rose 12% to $489 million in the fourth quarter from the third quarter, according to research firm Trepp LLC. That was the index's first increase in more than a year, though loan volume remains far smaller than 2007 levels. Most banks don't report construction-loan originations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American Institute of Architects' billings index, considered a leading indicator of future construction, climbed in November and December. That was the first two-month increase since mid-2007. On Wednesday, the trade group is expected to report that the index remained stable in January, suggesting that the commercial real-estate recovery is likely to be slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People and businesses and institutions in markets that are strong are finding ways to get things done," said Clark Davis, vice chairman of HOK in St. Louis. The architecture firm saw a slow rise in billings last year. The recovery "will be slow and gradual, and not a dramatic bounce," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, a major California office landlord, <span class="companylink">Kilroy Realty Corp</span>., told analysts that the company is in talks with potential tenants for at least five of its San Diego development sites. "We believe demand has turned a corner," Kilroy Chief Executive John Kilroy Jr. said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Philadelphia, developer <span class="companylink">Liberty Property Trust</span> on Feb. 8 announced plans to build a 205,000 square-foot office building for pharmaceutical giant <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline PLC</span>. Construction is expected to start this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some developers are even moving forward with speculative office buildings. In Rosslyn, Va., developer Monday Properties is erecting a speculative 35-story office tower even though it lacks any signed tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As new construction comes back, building strategies are emerging reshaped by the recession. For example, some shopping-mall developers are breaking ground on outlet centers that sell brand-name clothes at discount prices. <span class="companylink">Taubman Centers Inc</span>., which owns or manages 26 upscale malls in the U.S. and converted one to an outlet center last year, expects to announce at least one new outlet project this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Atlanta, the long-stalled cranes at the Streets of Buckhead project are expected to start moving again this year, according to the new developer, Dene Oliver. About 1,500 construction jobs will be created to finish more than 300,000 square feet of retail and entertainment space, 376 apartments and 40,000 square feet of office space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're starting to see product types and values firming up in major markets," Mr. Oliver said in an interview. "The time is just perfect for this project to come forward."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever pass a construction site and wonder what's happening? Technology unveiled by Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Tuesday will give the public fast access to building information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's Department of Buildings has started to print "Quick Response," or QR, codes -- similar to a bar code -- on all permits for buildings undergoing any type of construction in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Anyone passing by who wants to know more about a project will be able to scan the QR code with a smartphone and learn about the property owner, the approved scope of work and any complaints or violations related to that project," Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference on Broad Street in Lower Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building information is already available to the public on the city's website. "But the QR codes," the mayor said, "will provide instant access to a condensed mobile version of the Buildings Department webpage, which provides permit and violation history for every building in the city." The website currently receives more than one million views a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert LiMandri, the city's buildings commissioner, said most New Yorkers, when they spot a construction site that piques their curiosity, don't want to return to their home or office to get detailed information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They want to know now," Mr. LiMandri said, "because, you know, New Yorkers are demanding. Right, Mr. Mayor?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction permits will have QR codes added to them as they are replaced at the 975,000 building and construction sites in the city, according to City Hall. All permits are expected to have QR codes by 2013. Users of smartphones can download a free QR reader by going to the app store on their device.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We know that New Yorkers are always on the go," Mr. Bloomberg said. "And we want to give you every possible opportunity to communicate with your government wherever you are and at anytime of the day."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One U.S. boom is still intact: Big Government. The Case-Shiller home-price index showed 19 out of the 20 U.S. cities it measures suffered price declines from November to December. The only one still heading up? Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign dignitaries usually avoid local political rows. But Tuesday, Timothy Geithner praised U.K. counterpart George Osborne, saying in a radio interview he was "very impressed" with his tough austerity. The U.S. Treasury secretary explained the U.K. and U.S. are in different situations and need different medicine. That somewhat undermined opposition Labour Treasury spokesman Ed Balls, who accuses Mr. Osborne of cutting too far, too fast and wants further U.S.-style stimulus. The question for Mr. Osborne: Did Mr. Geithner's backing hint at Washington's concern that the U.K.'s political and economic fragility runs deep?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Existing-home sales unexpectedly rose last month, though a drop in prices to their lowest level in nearly nine years suggests the housing market continues to search for a bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for used homes increased by 2.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.36 million in January, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected home sales to decline by 0.8%, to an annual rate of 5.25 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite a strong finish last year, with a 12.5% jump in existing-home sales in December, the housing market remains a weak point in the economy. Last year was the worst year since 1997, with about 4.9 million homes sold, according to the NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The December sales rate was revised down to 5.22 million from an initial estimate 5.28 million, though the percentage increase was higher than the 12.3% gain previously reported. Historical revisions going back to 2008 didn't change the annual sales figures or monthly home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the 2010 sales figures, representing a drop of 4.8% from the previous year, may have actually been even lower because of miscounting by the Realtor group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR is reviewing data going back as far as 2007 to determine whether it overcounted sales, with a decision on whether revisions are needed expected by the summer. Economists who have been raising concerns about the NAR's data, saying sales may be overstated by as much as 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't know what that revision will be," Lawrence Yun, the Realtor group's chief economist, told reporters at a briefing to discuss the January data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But most indicators imply that NAR data probably has some upward drift," he said, noting that the last rebenchmarking in 2000 showed that the group's sales estimates were overstated by about 13%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any downward revisions could further deflate hope for a recovery in the market, which has suffered several setbacks since the financial crisis. The housing industry received a boost early last year from a home-buyer tax credit that helped revive sales, but activity sank after it expired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new threat to the housing market emerged in the fall, when several banks disclosed making errors on foreclosure documents. While the problems haven't had a measurable impact on sales, they have given would-be buyers another reason to be wary about entering the housing market. Tight lending standards and high joblessness have kept demand low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If past sales figures were determined to be worse than initially thought, that would also indicate that the inventory of homes remaining on the market is bigger than expected. Weak demand combined with the large backlog of unsold homes has kept prices on a downward slope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Yun said the fact that sales have climbed in five of the last six months suggests "the sales recovery appears to be a sustained gain."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, home resales were also higher than in the previous year for the first time in seven months, up 5.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the median sales price for an existing home fell to $158,800, the lowest level since April 2002. That is down 3.7% from the year-ago median price of $164,900 and well below the median of $168,800 in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of previously owned homes listed for sale contracted 5.1% at the end of January to 3.38 million available for sale. That represented a 7.6-month supply at the current sales pace, compared with a revised 8.2-month supply the previous month. The December backlog was revised up from an 8.1-month supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, a "shadow inventory" of unlisted bank-owned homes and potential foreclosures mean that prices could take even longer to stabilize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed properties accounted for about 37% of sales last month, compared with 36% in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun said he expects inventories to climb back up to between eight or nine months' worth of supply by the summer.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Lending Revives Stalled Projects</span>
</div><div class="author">By Anton Troianovski   </div><div>1075 words</div><div>23 February 2011</div><div>09:32</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An influx of fresh capital into U.S. commercial real estate is bringing some long-stalled development projects back to life and launching new construction of apartments, office buildings and shopping centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moves show that the industry, in a deep slump just a year ago, has entered recovery mode—at least in the nation's largest and healthiest markets. Analysts say the improved economy is giving rise to pockets of demand for new commercial space, while low yields on other investments prompt investors to seek higher returns in real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nascent turnaround comes even though many U.S. banks still are slogging through billions of dollars in bad commercial-real-estate loans, a big cause of bank failures. Still, some of the largest U.S. banks are tiptoeing back into commercial real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. financed as much construction lending in the first six weeks of 2011 as the nation's second-largest bank by assets did in all of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York company won't disclose construction-loan origination volume. "We have certainly started making construction loans again," Todd Maclin, head of <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>'s commercial bank, said in an interview. "In the third quarter and fourth quarter of last year, it started as a trickle, and now you're starting to see much more activity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Atlanta, development company OliverMcMillan said it has secured $300 million in private-equity funding to take control of and complete an unfinished, eight-acre development of shops, residential units and office space that has languished in the city's Buckhead section for two years. In Atlantic City, N.J., the developer of the half-built, 1,100-room Revel casino resort last week nailed down $1.15 billion in financing to complete the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug Linde, president of <span class="companylink">Boston Properties Inc</span>., said the office-building landlord is increasingly confident it will able to restart construction this year on a $1 billion Manhattan skyscraper. Work stopped in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Mr. Linde said the company might even go back to work on the 40-floor building without first signing up a major tenant, as banks, law firms and media companies dust off expansion plans to chase an expected scarcity of New York office space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the Census Bureau reported that new construction of apartment buildings jumped 80% in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 171,000 units, the highest rate since February 2009. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg unveiled plans earlier this month for, he said, the city's largest affordable-housing complex since the 1970s. Zaremba Group said Friday that the Cleveland developer has a $30 million deal to finish a 375-unit high-rise apartment complex in Tempe, Ariz., that has been stalled for more than two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the U.S. still is dotted with thousands of stalled construction sites, ranging from struggling apartment projects on the Brooklyn, N.Y., waterfront to shells of buildings in suburban Sacramento, Calif. And it will take years to replace more than two million construction jobs, or about 30% of the 2006 peak, lost since the real-estate bubble popped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Chicago, a 150-story skyscraper called the Chicago Spire and long planned to outstretch the 110-story Willis Tower as the city's tallest building, is a hole in the ground. Anglo Irish Bank Corp., the nationalized commercial-property lender at the center of Ireland's banking crisis, launched foreclosure proceedings against the Spire's developer last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But office buildings and other projects could help cushion the U.S. economy if public-sector building declines, as expected, due to government budget cuts and waning economic-stimulus aid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index of new-construction lending by hundreds of federally insured savings institutions rose 12% to $489 million in the fourth quarter from the third quarter, according to research firm Trepp LLC. That was the index's first increase in more than a year, though loan volume remains far smaller than 2007 levels. Most banks don't report construction-loan originations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American Institute of Architects' billings index, considered a leading indicator of future construction, climbed in November and December. That was the first two-month increase since mid-2007. On Wednesday, the trade group is expected to report that the index remained stable in January, suggesting that the commercial real-estate recovery is likely to be slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People and businesses and institutions in markets that are strong are finding ways to get things done," said Clark Davis, vice chairman of HOK in St. Louis. The architecture firm saw a slow rise in billings last year. The recovery "will be slow and gradual, and not a dramatic bounce," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, a major California office landlord, <span class="companylink">Kilroy Realty Corp</span>., told analysts that the company is in talks with potential tenants for at least five of its San Diego development sites. "We believe demand has turned a corner," Kilroy Chief Executive John Kilroy Jr. said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Philadelphia, developer <span class="companylink">Liberty Property Trust</span> on Feb. 8 announced plans to build a 205,000 square-foot office building for pharmaceutical giant <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline PLC</span>. Construction is expected to start this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some developers are even moving forward with speculative office buildings. In Rosslyn, Va., developer Monday Properties is erecting a speculative 35-story office tower even though it lacks any signed tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As new construction comes back, building strategies are emerging reshaped by the recession. For example, some shopping-mall developers are breaking ground on outlet centers that sell brand-name clothes at discount prices. <span class="companylink">Taubman Centers Inc</span>., which owns or manages 26 upscale malls in the U.S. and converted one to an outlet center last year, expects to announce at least one new outlet project this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Atlanta, the long-stalled cranes at the Streets of Buckhead project are expected to start moving again this year, according to the new developer, Dene Oliver. About 1,500 construction jobs will be created to finish more than 300,000 square feet of retail and entertainment space, 376 apartments and 40,000 square feet of office space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're starting to see product types and values firming up in major markets," Mr. Oliver said in an interview. "The time is just perfect for this project to come forward."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever pass a construction site and wonder what's happening? Technology unveiled by Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Tuesday will give the public fast access to building information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's Department of Buildings has started to print "Quick Response," or QR, codes—similar to a bar code—on all permits for buildings undergoing any type of construction in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Anyone passing by who wants to know more about a project will be able to scan the QR code with a smartphone and learn about the property owner, the approved scope of work and any complaints or violations related to that project," Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference on Broad Street in Lower Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building information is already available to the public on the city's website. "But the QR codes," the mayor said, "will provide instant access to a condensed mobile version of the Buildings Department webpage, which provides permit and violation history for every building in the city." The website currently receives more than one million views a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert LiMandri, the city's buildings commissioner, said most New Yorkers, when they spot a construction site that piques their curiosity, don't want to return to their home or office to get detailed information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They want to know now," Mr. LiMandri said, "because, you know, New Yorkers are demanding. Right, Mr. Mayor?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction permits will have QR codes added to them as they are replaced at the 975,000 building and construction sites in the city, according to City Hall. All permits are expected to have QR codes by 2013. Users of smartphones can download a free QR reader by going to the app store on their device.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We know that New Yorkers are always on the go," Mr. Bloomberg said. "And we want to give you every possible opportunity to communicate with your government wherever you are and at anytime of the day."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Property Taxes Draw Fire; Developers and Contractors Threaten to Stop Development, Push Proposal</span>
</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown   </div><div>661 words</div><div>22 February 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frustrated with ever-rising property tax bills on rental apartment buildings, the city's real-estate industry is warning the Bloomberg administration that if it doesn't change its tax policy, development of large new rental buildings will come to a halt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, members of the Real Estate Board of New York met with the Bloomberg administration to complain that tax bills have been climbing faster than income on rental apartment buildings. They said up to one-third of some building's revenue is going to taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase has become a particular concern for owners of rentals built within the past two decades with 20% of their units set aside for low-income families. Should taxes continue to outpace revenue, the Real Estate Board says new development of these so-called 80/20 projects would be unfeasible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also have warned that owners of existing 80/20 buildings will be forced to convert to condominiums or&nbsp;deregulate their low-income apartments once expiring tax abatements wear off. "Once the abatement period is over, they cannot survive at 33% of net income," Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board, said of landlords.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To address the issue, Mr. Spinola's group is pushing a plan to cap taxes at 20% of revenue for developers who agree to reserve the low-income apartments for multiple decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Frankel, Commissioner of the Department of Finance, said Monday he was considering the proposal. "We're obviously always concerned if someone says to us that taxes would keep someone from investing in a property," he said. "What we are trying to do is assess properties in the fairest ways we possibly can."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall within the past five years, Mr. Frankel agreed that revenues on rental buildings have been out outpaced by the city's valuations of the properties, but not by a large amount. "It doesn't seem they're too out of line," he said. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underlying the Real Estate Board's criticism on the rental tax rates is a long and deep frustration among the city's top landlords with the property tax code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally, single-family homeowners and families who live in high-priced co-ops tend to be favored by the code and shielded from spikes in values, while owners of office buildings and rentals pay taxes accounting for a greater share of their value. While various city officials over the years have spoken critically of these aspects of the tax code, a reform would take significant political will given the electoral strength of single-family homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further frustrating landlords were the latest tentative assessment rolls, released last month, showed a jump of 8.5% in assessed values for Manhattan rentals, compared with 5.7% for one-, two-, and three-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most 80/20 buildings have been operating with a full or partial tax abatement so their tax bills haven't been a sore spot. But now that the abatement on the older buildings is expiring—it typically lasts 20 years—and full taxes are coming due, the issue has become more urgent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Ross, chairman of Related Cos., has been particularly outspoken on the issue, multiple people involved with discussions said. Mr. Ross is one of the city's most active developers of rental apartments in the city, many of which are now losing their tax abatements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not clear whether developers would make good on their threat to stop development at this point. In a slowly recovering market, numerous developers including Douglas Durst and Glenwood Management have said they are planning new 80/20 rental buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Real Estate Board's proposal, if it were adopted, would further strain the city's finances, although Mr. Spinola declined to attach a price tag. The city depends on property taxes to cover about one-quarter of the budget.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing crash may have been more severe than initial estimates have shown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors, which produces a widely watched monthly estimate of sales of previously owned homes, is examining the possibility that it over-counted U.S. home sales dating back as far as 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group reported that there were 4.9 million sales of previously owned homes in 2010, down 5.7% from 5.2 million in 2009. But <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a real-estate analytics firm based in Santa Ana, Calif., counted just 3.3 million homes sales last year, a drop of 10.8% from 3.7 million in 2009. <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says NAR could have overstated home sales by as much as 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While revisions wouldn't affect reported home-price numbers, they could show that the housing market faces a bigger overhang in inventory, given the weaker demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, NAR said that it would take 8.1 months to sell some 3.6 million homes listed for sale at the current pace, but the number of months it would take could be even higher if sales are revised down. Any revisions wouldn't have an impact on homeowners, but it could have consequences for the real-estate industry. Downward revisions would show that "this horrific downturn in the housing market has been even more pronounced than what people thought, and people already thought it was pretty bad," said Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR said the data, which are used by economists, investors and the real-estate industry to gauge the health of the housing market, could be revised downward this summer. Lawrence Yun, chief economist at NAR, wasn't specific about whether and by how much the revisions could reduce reported sales, and he raised the possibility that the <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> estimates have understated the number of home sales. "This is a very important issue, and we are looking at it carefully right now," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say any overstatement is the result of difficulty tracking data during market corrections. "This is an economic data issue, not a gaming-the-numbers issue," said Sam Khater, senior economist at <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>. "Any time you get big shifts in the market, the numbers go haywire for a bit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past decade, a growing number of housing-research firms have sprouted up, offering new ways to track home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, which was spun off from <span class="companylink">First American Financial Corp</span>. last year, measures sales by tracking property records through local courthouses. The firm says its data covers approximately 85% of all home sales tracked by NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR, which is due to report January home sales on Wednesday, uses a sample of sales data reported by local multiple-listing services to calculate monthly changes in sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To produce estimates of annual sales, it uses a model that is benchmarked to the figures reported in the decennial U.S. Census. The model requires making certain assumptions for population growth and other measures in between the census surveys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those models could have over-counted sales due to recent consolidation among multiple-listing services, which has resulted in those firms having wider coverage of housing markets. NAR's tally could be distorted if the firms "are sending us more home sales because they have a larger coverage area, but without informing us" that their reach has grown, said Mr. Yun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because not every home sale goes through a multiple-listing service, NAR must also make additional assumptions. For example, it must estimate what share of transactions are "for-sale by owner," and the housing downturn has sharply reduced that segment of the market. Consequently, the NAR could over-estimate sales if it hasn't properly adjusted for a smaller "for-sale by owner" share, said Mr. Yun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR typically produces revisions of home-sales data at the end of every decade based on the latest Census survey data. But because the 2010 Census didn't ask U.S. residents about home sales, NAR must devise a new way to build its home-sales model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several economists approached NAR late last year with questions about its modeling. NAR economists promised to study the issue during a December conference call that included economists from the Mortgage Bankers Association, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the Federal Reserve, the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> and <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists from the Mortgage Bankers Association said they became skeptical after the MBA's index of mortgage-purchase applications appeared to be a less reliable indicator of home sales. The index had been closely correlated to NAR existing home-sales data until 2007. Even assuming a high share of all-cash sales, purchase-loan application data suggests that home sales have been overstated by 10% to 15%, said Jay Brinkmann, the MBA's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If they are off by this much, this consistently, it would be sending the wrong signal to the market," said Mr. Brinkmann.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downward revisions in existing home sales could have an impact on real-estate related businesses, but economists said it isn't clear that they would have a meaningful impact on the broader economy, which typically relies more heavily on new-home construction to drive growth.</p>

"Any time you get big shifts in the market, the numbers go haywire for a bit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past decade, a growing number of housing-research firms have sprouted up, offering new ways to track home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, which was spun off from <span class="companylink">First American Financial Corp</span>. last year, measures sales by tracking property records through local courthouses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm says its data covers approximately 85% of all home sales tracked by NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR, which is due to report January home sales on Wednesday, uses a sample of sales data reported by local multiple-listing services to calculate monthly changes in sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To produce estimates of annual sales, it uses a model that is benchmarked to the figures reported in the decennial U.S. Census. The model requires making certain assumptions for population growth and other measures in between the census surveys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those models could have over counted sales due to consolidation among multiple-listing services in recent years, which has resulted in those firms having wider coverage of housing markets. NAR's tally could be distorted if the firms "are sending us more home sales because they have a larger coverage area, but without informing us" that their reach has grown, said NAR's Mr. Yun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because not every home sale goes through a multiple-listing service, NAR must also make additional assumptions. For example, it must estimate what share of transactions are "for-sale by owner," and the housing downturn has sharply reduced that segment of the market. Consequently, the NAR could over-estimate sales if it hasn't properly adjusted for a smaller "for-sale by owner" share, said Mr. Yun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR typically produces revisions of home-sales data at the end of every decade based on the latest Census survey data. But because the 2010 Census didn't ask U.S. residents about home sales, NAR must devise a new way to build its home-sales model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several economists approached NAR late last year with questions about its modeling. NAR economists promised to study the issue during a December conference call that included economists from the Mortgage Bankers Association, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the Federal Reserve, the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> and <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vying for a role in the restructuring of well-known luxury resorts in bankruptcy court, an affiliate of the <span class="companylink">Government of Singapore Investment Corp</span>. is setting the stage for a potential battle with a group including hedge-fund firm <span class="companylink">Paulson &amp; Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">Winthrop Realty Trust</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In court papers filed Monday, the <span class="companylink">Government of Singapore Investment Corp</span>., or GIC, spelled out a $1.48 billion offer it has made to acquire the properties, which include the Claremont Resort and Spa in Berkeley, Calif., and Hawaii's Grand Wailea Resort Hotel &amp; Spa in Maui.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sovereign-wealth fund said it already has lined up some $900 million in financing for the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owners, the Paulson-Winthrop group, haven't responded to the offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It defies reason" that the resorts haven't embraced the GIC offer "that would assist them in expeditiously emerging from Chapter 11," the Singapore wealth fund said in court papers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GIC bid would strip control from Paulson-Winthrop, which acquired ownership of the resorts less than a month ago from a <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> real-estate fund through a foreclosure proceeding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That group has said it wants to invest in the properties itself, as has junior debt holder Five Mile Capital Partners LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric Morath</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeking a Solution In Wine Country</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fort Worth, Texas, developer Crescent Real Estate Holdings LLC is trying to hold on to its marquee resort in California wine country by restructuring and extending a $55 million mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The securitized loan backing the Fairmont Sonoma Mission Inn &amp; Spa in Sonoma, Calif., was to come due Feb. 1 with the resort worth less than the outstanding balance, according to Realpoint LLC, a debt-analysis company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Crescent and the mortgage's special servicer, Midland Loan Services, are discussing a three-month forbearance deal to allow for more time to hammer out a longer-term extension of the loan, Realpoint says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midland reported that the loan restructuring could be completed by May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crescent "has indicated their willingness to contribute significant amounts of capital, fund an interest reserve" and make other accommodations, Realpoint says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crescent is jointly owned by <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> and Goff Capital Partners LP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many hotel loans are subject to similar restructuring talks. Roughly 14% of securitized mortgages tied to hotels, or $6.2 billion, are now at least 60 days past due, according to Fitch Ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kris Hudson</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the Horizon: Debt?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Predictions of the commercial-mortgage-backed-securities market's return are rising by the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a survey of top figures in the lending market that is slated for release Wednesday, real-estate firm <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Inc</span>. says one-fifth of respondents now say that issuance of CMBS, bundled-together mortgages sold as bonds to investors, will top $50 billion in the U.S. this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Predictions were generally more restrained at the start of the year. A January survey by Commercial Mortgage Alert found just one of 12 top CMBS executives thought the market would top $50 billion. Now, a flurry of deals in the past six weeks, with more to come, appears to be building optimism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, while lenders may be optimistic and the number of issuers is increasing, the same cannot be said about investors buying the bonds. Just three firms have dominated the market for the riskiest slices of the CMBS deals. Such a small universe gives those buyers the upper hand when banks are trying to sell their loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They are active, but they're also pretty picky," said Tom Fish, an executive managing director at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the groundhog spotted his shadow, there is no early spring in sight for the U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the primary selling season, which traditionally kicks off on Super Bowl Sunday, is off to a sluggish start. The index of weekly purchase applications from the Mortgage Bankers Association is down 18% from a year ago. And this month's home-builder sentiment survey, considered a leading gauge of activity, remained at recessionary levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data this week aren't likely to inspire much more confidence. New-home sales are expected to be down 14% in January from a year earlier. Purchases of existing homes are seen up 4%, in part because of continued foreclosure sales. Tuesday, the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index is expected to show home prices posted a 2% year-to-year drop in December, more than November's 1.6% decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weakness partly may reflect unusually bad winter weather. Additionally, prices and activity a year ago temporarily were juiced by the first-time home-buyer tax credit. Still, despite improvement in other parts of the economy, housing is barely managing to thaw.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It doesn't help that the somewhat brighter outlook for economic growth is lifting interest rates. Average 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages jumped above 5% this month after hitting a low of 4.17% in November, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That risks denting affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market's only real bright spots are largely in apartments and farmland. Single-family housing remains plagued by oversupply and weak demand. The shadow inventory of homes in delinquency or foreclosure has fallen from its 8.1 million peak, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, but remained at an elevated 6.7 million in the fourth quarter. <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span> reckons prices need to fall another 5% to 10% to better align inventory with demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price declines are fine, so long as they spur sales rather than scare off would-be buyers. Even if prices stay weak or slip further, sales at least generate broader economic activity and chip away at the inventory overhang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What the housing market, and the economy, can't afford right now is a sleepy spring.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown   </div><div>664 words</div><div>22 February 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A20</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frustrated with ever-rising property tax bills on rental apartment buildings, the city's real-estate industry is warning the Bloomberg administration that if it doesn't change its tax policy, development of large new rental buildings will come to a halt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, members of the Real Estate Board of New York met with the Bloomberg administration to complain that tax bills have been climbing faster than income on rental apartment buildings. They said up to one-third of some building's revenue is going to taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase has become a particular concern for owners of rentals built within the past two decades with 20% of their units set aside for low-income families. Should taxes continue to outpace revenue, the Real Estate Board says new development of these so-called 80/20 projects would be unfeasible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also have warned that owners of existing 80/20 buildings will be forced to convert to condominiums orderegulate their low-income apartments once expiring tax abatements wear off. "Once the abatement period is over, they cannot survive at 33% of net income," Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board, said of landlords.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To address the issue, Mr. Spinola's group is pushing a plan to cap taxes at 20% of revenue for developers who agree to reserve the low-income apartments for multiple decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Frankel, Commissioner of the Department of Finance, said Monday he was considering the proposal. "We're obviously always concerned if someone says to us that taxes would keep someone from investing in a property," he said. "What we are trying to do is assess properties in the fairest ways we possibly can."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall within the past five years, Mr. Frankel agreed that revenues on rental buildings have been out outpaced by the city's valuations of the properties, but not by a large amount. "It doesn't seem they're too out of line," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underlying the Real Estate Board's criticism on the rental tax rates is a long and deep frustration among the city's top landlords with the property tax code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally, single-family homeowners and families who live in high-priced co-ops tend to be favored by the code and shielded from spikes in values, while owners of office buildings and rentals pay taxes accounting for a greater share of their value. While various city officials over the years have spoken critically of these aspects of the tax code, a reform would take significant political will given the electoral strength of single-family homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further frustrating landlords were the latest tentative assessment rolls, released last month, showed a jump of 8.5% in assessed values for Manhattan rentals, compared with 5.7% for one-, two-, and three-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most 80/20 buildings have been operating with a full or partial tax abatement so their tax bills haven't been a sore spot. But now that the abatement on the older buildings is expiring -- it typically lasts 20 years -- and full taxes are coming due, the issue has become more urgent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Ross, chairman of Related Cos., has been particularly outspoken on the issue, multiple people involved with discussions said. Mr. Ross is one of the city's most active developers of rental apartments in the city, many of which are now losing their tax abatements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not clear whether developers would make good on their threat to stop development at this point. In a slowly recovering market, numerous developers including Douglas Durst and Glenwood Management have said they are planning new 80/20 rental buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Real Estate Board's proposal, if it were adopted, would further strain the city's finances, although Mr. Spinola declined to attach a price tag. The city depends on property taxes to cover about one-quarter of the budget.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese and Hong Kong stocks ended modestly higher after a roller-coaster ride driven by hopes for solid economic growth. Property developers fell after Chinese authorities announced fresh restrictions on Beijing home purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most other major Asian markets also edged up. Japanese shares chalked up a fourth straight advance, with sentiment helped by Wednesday's rise on Wall Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan's Nikkei Stock Average added 0.3% to 10836.64. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.6% to 23301.84. The Shanghai Composite Index edged up 0.1% to 2926.96. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 climbed 0.2% to 4938.44. But South Korea's Kospi fell 0.6% to 1977.22 on continued foreign selling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India's Sensex rose 1.1% to 18506.82, the fifth consecutive increase, led by banking shares as the pace of food-price inflation slowed in the week ended Feb. 5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On mainland Chinese exchanges, property developers declined after the Beijing municipal government placed fresh limits on home purchases Wednesday. One of the measures introduced was that first-time home buyers who aren't Beijing residents have to prove they have made social-security payments in the five years before a purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Core Pacific-Yamaichi said the proportion of multiple home buyers and nonregistered residents are high in Beijing; "We therefore expect the policy to have a significant downward pressure on home sales and later on home prices," the brokerage house said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beijing Vantone Real Estate fell 1.8%, <span class="companylink">China Vanke</span> shed 1.9%, <span class="companylink">Poly Real Estate Group</span> was off 2.6%, and Gemdale fell 2.3%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, the CBRE Investors unit of CB Richard Ellis Group Inc. had $216 million of revenue and $56 million of normalized earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The 2010 revenue and normalized Ebitda for the ING REIM business of ING Groep NV were $305 million and $104 million, respectively. In a chart accompanying a Wednesday Property Report article about CB Richard Ellis's acquisition of the bulk of ING REIM, the results for CBRE Investors and ING REIM were reversed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ Feb. 17, 2011)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group Inc</span>. has agreed to purchase the lion's share of the real-estate-investment-management business of Dutch financial group <span class="companylink">ING Groep NV</span>, creating the world's largest property-fund manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The all-cash transaction, valued at $940 million, will combine CBRE's global investment-management business with most of ING REIM's investment-management business in Europe and Asia. CBRE, the world's largest commercial-property-services group, also is buying Clarion Real Estate Securities, the U.S.-based global-listed property-securities business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate deal, ING agreed to sell ING Clarion, its U.S.-based private-market real-estate-investment manager, to the management of that operation in a deal valued at $100 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bulk of ING REIM will be merged with CBRE Investors, the property-services group's investment manager, to create a global real-estate-investment manager with about $97.4 billion of assets under management in 102 funds. The deal is the latest example of a property company taking advantage of a rare opportunity as the impact of the financial crisis continues to ripple through the global economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a really compelling opportunity for us," Brett White, CBRE's chief executive, told The Wall Street Journal. "We are acquiring this business at the perfect time, at the low-end of the cycle just as we enter a period of healthy and protracted expansion in the industry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The opportunity emerged as a result of the troubles faced by ING in the financial crisis. ING sustained heavy losses on property loans when the subprime crisis hit, forcing the Dutch government to step in and purchase nonvoting securities from the bank for 10 billion euros ($13.5 billion) in November 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ING has since repaid 5 billion euros plus 606 million euros in interest. In November, ING can allow the government to convert its nonvoting securities to ordinary shares or lieu of a cash payment. There is no deadline for payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the bailout, ING agreed to reduce its exposure to the property business and last year decided to sell its fund manager ING REIM.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With these transactions, we continue to deliver on our strategic objectives of reducing exposure to real estate, simplifying our company and further strengthening our capital base," ING CEO Jan Hommen said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CBRE's shares rose 71 cents, or 2.9%, to $25.34, in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. <span class="companylink">ING Groep</span>'s American depository receipts fell 13 cents, or 1.1%, at $12.09, also on the NYSE.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal appeared positive for CBRE partly because it represents a strategic coup, with the Los Angeles property group exploiting ING's troubles and pushing the price down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate analysts at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> welcomed the deal, saying it should be "meaningful accretive" to earnings. While noting that the deal had been expected, the analysts added: "Pricing does appear a lot less than expected, which was closer to the $1.5 billion range."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> estimates that the ING acquisition could add as much as 30 cents to CBRE's earnings per share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One benefit to CBRE is a whole new set of clients. ING REIM's more than 400 institutional clients are almost all based in Europe. And ING's client base includes a predominance of European pension funds and insurance and other financial-service industry investors, complementing CBRE's U.S.-heavy client base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ING's assets under management include about $29.5 billion in Europe, $5.1 billion in Asia, $19.4 billion in listed securities, and $5.8 billion in global funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"ING's clients are mostly Europe-based and CBRE's clients are mostly U.S.-based," Gil Borok, CBRE's chief finance officer, said during a conference call. But whether the acquisition is successful will depend on a number of factors. One is whether all those ING fund managers will feel comfortable with CBRE running the show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another issue is the state of the global property business. There is much evidence of improvement and the mood is certainly better than in 2008. But boosting profit from the funds, securities and buildings under the wings of CBRE Investors will depend on whether property valuations and real-estate stock prices can continue rising.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'It's the real world -- only better." This is how Jay Wright, business-development director at technology company <span class="companylink">Qualcomm Inc</span>., describes the latest buzz technology to grip the digital world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So-called "augmented reality" is the overlaying of digital information onto the real world, and everyone from games designers to retailers to health-care companies to estate agents are gearing up to use it. While the potential for such technology to change the world is vast, the biggest challenge for its backers will be to convert this virtual revolution into rock-solid profits. Fortunately, there are countless ways this can be achieved, but not all are immediately obvious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Augmented reality has shifted from its high-industrial beginnings at aerospace firm <span class="companylink">Boeing Co</span>., where it was used to overlay schematics of complex wiring diagrams onto actual wiring via a headset, to being a tool that offers to bring together the real world and the Internet. Such a confluence of the actual and virtual worlds should already have offered a route to riches untold. But the commercial potential of this new technology is very far from being realized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In laymen's terms, augmented reality is defined as computer-generated content -- which typically includes graphics, audio and other sensory enhancements -- that is superimposed over live images to enhance the real world. In mobile devices, where augmented reality's future seems to be heading, it uses everyday technology such as cameras, global-positioning systems and electronic compasses. These are built into the phone, in combination with WiFi and broadband networks, to bring together location, orientation and context -- all adding up to a richer experience of the world around the user.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some early examples of augmented reality in action include an "app" on smartphones that will tell a user the location of the nearest metro station, if he or she just points the phone at the street on which they are standing. Another app, from the Museum of London, will overlay on the phone's "street view" an image of what the street looked like hundreds of years ago. Augmented reality even allows users to point a so-called "Stargazer" app at the night sky and it will overlay the constellations, stars and planets and facts about them. Others offer the chance to see reviews, menus and comments added onto the view of a restaurant or bar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such technology is undoubtedly useful, and in the case of the Museum of London's app, fascinating to some, but does it have any genuine commercial potential? Mr. Wright believes it has. "The means of monetizing augmented-reality apps won't be any different to any other app," he says. "Some will pay to download, some will use app-purchasing and others will be ad-funded. There may well be some new players and some new platforms, but the business models for these apps will be the same as all the others."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Yellow Pages in the U.S. is testing the use of augmented reality to overlay adverts -- paid for by businesses -- to street views when the app is used. Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, <span class="companylink">eBay Inc</span>. is testing a service that will show users all those people who are trading goods in the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EBay's vice president of local classifieds, Bob van Dijk, is adamant that the future lies in local sales -- that and adding virtual technology to its burgeoning real-estate business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.K., property website RightMove.com has also toyed with a real-estate app, developed by mobile technology firm Mobile Interactive Group Ltd., which works in the same way as <span class="companylink">eBay</span>'s proposed new service. In this case, users point the phone up and down the street and the app tells them what is for sale, or to rent, how much it costs and gives the user the chance to contact the property agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not only in real estate and classified ads that this new virtual technology has money-making potential, says Theo Forbath, vice president of innovation strategy at software company <span class="companylink">Aricent Inc</span>..</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The real money lies in turning augmented reality into the consumer space with games, entertainment and education," he says. "In the next 12 to 24 months you will see it everywhere, changing how people shop, by bringing the advantages of the Web to the in-store experience. It will transform business, allowing for better virtual meetings and it will play a big part on both children's educational toys and adult education. Think of those headsets you currently get given at museums: These will soon all be apps on mobiles."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is exercising the calculators of venture capitalists the world over, however, is how to turn this technology into something that creates genuine revenue streams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Retail and gaming are the obvious areas that can deliver revenues with augmented reality right now," says Mr. Wright. "There are already shoot-'em-up games you can play, interactively, overlaid onto the real world and there are already many games developers working on such games that will sell at a premium -- expect to see them on sale early next year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Chippindale, chief executive of augmented reality retail pioneer Holition, believes that the future of the technology lies in the consumer arena. "We saw huge interest in our augmented reality screens at the front of Selfridges in London. These allowed people to virtually try on Tissot watches without going inside the store," he says. "Tissot saw sales of its watches rise by 83% in the store while the trial was running."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another area where retailers are set to benefit is in applying augmented reality to technology that is already in widespread use, such as bar-code scanners. Built in to a number of retailer apps, bar-code scanners allow consumers to scan a bar code and launch all manner of information about that item. "EBay has built this into its sellers' app," notes Roeland Loof, head of mobile in Europe for the auction site. "Now anyone wanting to sell something can simply scan its bar code and use the information provided to create a sales profile. This makes selling via mobile much easier."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But augmented reality has perhaps one more potentially lucrative surprise up its sleeve. While much attention has been placed on how it can extend things that already exist, many are starting to look at how it can generate a whole new revenue stream through its use in health care -- or more specifically, health monitoring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our research shows that 19 out of 22 health-care professionals already see wireless health-care monitoring as vital," says Andy Zimmerman from <span class="companylink">Accenture Ltd</span>. "There are already millions of devices in circulation measuring heart rate, blood sugar, asthma and even whether elderly patients are moving or upright. And consumers appear to be willing to pay, often relatively large amounts of money, to get the data from these devices [on their mobiles] from aging parents so that they can monitor them remotely. It all comes down to the fact that residential care for the elderly is very expensive, so they are trying to look after them at home -- and wireless technology helps do this."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This may not be what most people imagine when they think of augmented reality, but it is perhaps the main money spinner for using data to "augment" the real world.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamestown Properties, the Georgia-based real estate firm that took in the lion's share of the proceeds when <span class="companylink">Google Inc</span>. bought its New York headquarters, is reinvesting hundreds of millions of dollars in another Chelsea property well known for its retail space and trendy media tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamestown has cut a deal to pay more than $225 million to buy out its partners in Chelsea Market, a property whose redevelopment as a specialty-food destination and media mecca played a major role in the meatpacking district's renaissance. Home to stores such as Amy's Bread and Lobster Place and tenants such as the Food Network and Major League Baseball Advanced Media, it gets more than 120,000 visitors a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamestown, which has been an investor in the property since 2003, also is planning to add a 300,000-square-foot tower to the building, to be used either for additional office space or a hotel, said Jamestown Managing Director Michael Phillips. The firm plans to begin a public-review process in the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not a fully completed asset," Mr. Phillips said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamestown is buying out the stakes in the property -- which takes up the entire block between 10th and 11th avenues and 15th and 16th streets -- formerly held by <span class="companylink">Angelo, Gordon &amp; Co</span>., Belvedere Capital and Irwin Cohen, the developer who conceived of the Chelsea Market in the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal values the property at about $800 million, a reminder of the enormous wealth that can be created by investors who recognize the potential of a dilapidated buildings. In the early 1990s, when Mr. Cohen purchased the debt on what would become Chelsea Market, he paid less than $10 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamestown has a history of making money in Chelsea. The firm, which runs funds for German investors, owned the majority stake of 111 Eighth Avenue, the behemoth office property across the street from Chelsea Market, which was purchased by <span class="companylink">Google</span> in a $1.9 billion deal, the city's largest commercial real estate transaction of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chelsea Market's success is tinged with a note of sadness: One of the key players behind it was Angelo, Gordon's head of real estate, Keith Barket, who died late last year at 49 of a rare form of cancer. Mr. Cohen in an interview said that Mr. Barket's willingness to put money behind the Chelsea Market concept represented "the most significant event of my business life."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Phillips said he and his former partners have made arrangements to dedicate the concourse fountain to Mr. Barket, whom he described as "a great visionary."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chelsea Market's rise coincides with the neighborhood's dramatic transformation, from crime-ridden wasteland to a high-end office and retail district with amenities such as the High Line (which runs through the building), Hudson River Park, Chelsea Piers and soon a branch of the Whitney museum. The meatpacking district, roughly bounded by 14th, Hudson, Gansevoort and West streets, is now home to some of the city's hottest bars and restaurants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's probably been our most profitable real estate transaction," says Adam Schwartz, the head of U.S. and European real estate for Angelo, Gordon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhood was a lot different in 1993 when Mr. Cohen, a developer of office and manufacturing space in Manhattan and Queens, bought the mortgage on the aging complex of 16 old factory buildings for less than $9 a square foot, just as the property was being foreclosed on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was the Wild West in Manhattan," Mr. Cohen recalls. "There had been three gangland-style murders in the building, with people on their knees shot in the back of the head. The building was controlled by street prostitutes, who told the staff when to open and close the loading docks. They used the loading docks for their clothes changes. And the tenants were in a revolt."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Granted, there weren't many tenants to speak of. And those that there were -- a man who produced TV ads, a firm that manufactured women's ready-to-wear -- were paying rents of $3 or $4 a square foot, when they paid at all. At least one tenant had taken to diverting his rent to pay for armed building guards, Mr. Cohen says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the backing of Uzbek investors, Mr. Cohen and his daughter Cheryl went on to tear down the walls between the 16 buildings comprising the complex and create a giant, 1.25-million-square-foot office and retail building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They opened the retail portion in 1997 and Angelo, Gordon and Belvedere joined the ownership group one year later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the beginning, their plan was to woo retailers with low rents and the opportunity to both produce and sell products at the same location. Amy's Bread, for example, moved its ovens into the manufacturing space and leased retail space in the 800-foot concourse connecting Ninth and Tenth avenues. The retailers, in turn, attracted office tenants to the upper floors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That was Irwin's brainchild," says Glen Siegel, founder of Belvedere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ground-floor tenants also include Manhattan Fruit Exchange and Sarabeth's. The upper floors drew tenants such as <span class="companylink">Oxygen Media</span> and NY1. Thanks to the building's dramatic, 30-foot ceilings, HBO shot the prison show "Oz" there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Irwin Cohen sparked an area renaissance which over time defined and refined a gritty neighborhood into one of the most well balanced, sexy, submarkets in the city," says Doug Harmon, the Eastdil Secured senior managing director who represented both sides in the transaction, in addition to engineering the sale of the <span class="companylink">Google</span> building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, asking rents for new retail tenants in the concourse are more than $100 a square foot, compared with about $25 a square foot in 1998. Rents for office space have risen from between $15 and $18 in 1998 to more than $50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 1998, the net annual income on Chelsea Market has grown from $5 million to more than $40 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamestown owned a majority stake in the property before it reached a deal to buy out its partners, according to people familiar with the matter. The partners also had incentives that gave them a bigger economic stake if they increased its value beyond a certain amount. The property also has close to $200 million in debt on it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As property investors scour the European landscape for prudent acquisitions, the German industrial city of Braunschweig isn't likely to be high on their itineraries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet at the end of January, Deka Immobilien GmbH, one of Europe's most active property investors last year, agreed to pay €250 million ($339.6 million) to acquire the Schloss Arkaden shopping center in downtown Braunschweig from CS Euroreal, an open-ended property fund managed by Credit Suisse AG's Credit Suisse Asset Management Immobilien Kapitalanlagegesellschaft mbH.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The acquisition is among the largest deals in Germany in the past 12 months, and the price tag puts it among some of the largest deals in Europe. But it is the location, rather than the price, that is striking about Deka's purchase. The acquisition of Schloss Arkaden demonstrates how so-called secondary markets, locations beyond Europe's handfull of major international cities, could be poised to make a comeback this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Braunschweig shows that secondary markets, what we call the B-cities, are going to have a role to play in our investment strategy this year, particularly for our 'spezialfonds' aimed at institutional investors," says Thomas Schmengler, managing director of Deka Immobilien.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with London or Paris, Braunschweig is a backwater. It has a population of about 245,000 and an unemployment rate of about 8%. There is some industry, especially car maker <span class="companylink">Volkswagen</span>, located in the nearby city of Wolfsburg. But the entire region of Braunschweig can't compare with the purchasing power of a single high-street neighborhood in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what is driving investors into the boonies at a time when bank financing is still tight and the European economic recovery is being shaken by rising commodity prices and worrying new from the Middle East?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is very difficult to find really good assets in primary markets for our institutional products in A-cities like Paris or London, at the yields we expect, between 5.5% and 6.5%. So it makes sense to invest in B-cities if you can get absolute premium assets," explains Mr. Schmengler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the resurgence of secondary markets could be thwarted by the higher risk associated with investing in them. In a report published Feb. 3, ratings agency <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> warned that commercial mortgage-backed securities will continue to perform poorly over the next five years. <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> added that CMBS loans secured by "non-prime properties" that need refinancing between 2012 and 2013 face the highest risk of being downgraded because lenders are still reluctant to accept secondary properties as collateral. <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> doesn't expect lending for property purchases in secondary markets to improve much over the next two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there is a clear trend toward investment in secondary markets. In its annual ranking of the top 25 European property markets, measured by the volume of investment in commercial property, research group <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span> reveals some surprising changes in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's no surprise that London and Paris top the list. But then it gets interesting: Stockholm jumped to third place last year from No. 8 in 2009, overtaking Moscow, which slipped to fourth place. Glasgow rose to the No. 10 spot from 19, while investment in commercial property in Manchester increased 136% to €1.3 billion euros, boosting the city's position in the rankings to 12th from 21st. Leeds joined the top 25 for the first time, and Gothenburg, Sweden, rose to No. 24 from 39.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes in the ranking, published in RCA's report Europe Capital Trends on Tuesday, are "another indication that the transaction recovery is now spreading to secondary markets," RCA writes in the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investment is "gradually rippling out into other markets," says Richard Bloxam, <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>'s managing director of capital markets in Europe. "Investors are increasingly willing to compromise on the city but not on the property. The property must be in a great location in whatever city you're buying."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New AXA Fund</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign of growing interest in new development, AXA Real Estate Investment Managers, part of <span class="companylink">AXA SA</span> and Europe's biggest real-estate manager with about €39 billion of assets under management, is expected to announce Wednesday that it has achieved a so-called second closing of its Development Venture III pan-European development fund, raising an additional €147.5 million in equity. That brings total equity in the fund to €377.5 million. Including debt, that gives the fund purchasing power of about €1.3 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The AXA fund managers will continue to target acquisitions in Paris and London, but will also consider opportunities in other major European cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The AXA fund will be used primarily to invest in sites where development hasn't taken place yet. But it could also take stakes in developments that have been launched but not completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the markets for prime office and retail space tightening in some areas, the AXA fund is an example of how investors are also becoming increasingly willing to put money into unfinished developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are seeing increasing willingness of investors to take some leasing risk on developments that are leased up to 80% or 85%," says Mr. Bloxam. "That wasn't possible 12 months ago."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates could be one percentage point higher and house prices 10% lower if the U.S. mortgage market were fully privatized, according to a paper to be released Tuesday by Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The calculations help build Mr. Zandi's case for replacing <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> with new entities constituting a public-private hybrid system for financing home loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposal is the latest in a growing list of white papers by economists and academics looking to influence the debate over how to reinvent the nation's mortgage market. The Obama administration is set to issue its own recommendations as soon as this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the last 40 years, the housing-finance system has been an odd blend of public and private roles. Fannie and Freddie buy mortgages from banks and other originators, repackaging them for sale to investors as securities and making investors whole when borrowers default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors long assumed that the shareholder-owned firms had an "implied" government guarantee, allowing them to borrow at below-market rates. That enabled them to fund low-cost 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. The housing bust forced the government to take over the firms in 2008. Few believe the status quo is desirable or sustainable, but there's significant disagreement over how to design a system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conservative Republicans say government ties should be severed to protect taxpayers, while Democrats and some moderate Republicans say government backing may be needed to keep mortgages available to qualified borrowers, particularly during bad economic times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zandi argues that a purely public market risks putting too much risk on taxpayers because policy makers would be tempted to subsidize homeownership by setting mortgage-insurance fees too low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A purely private market won't work either, he says, because investors will assume that the U.S. government will intervene in a crisis. "No matter how much you talk about 'no government backstop,' when push comes to shove, the government will step in," says Mr. Zandi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, lenders would be likely to retreat or demand much higher rates during financial shocks, exacerbating downturns. And lenders would be much less likely to offer 30-year fixed-rate loans at attractive rates, leading the majority of homeowners to opt for adjustable-rate mortgages. "I could be wrong, but I'm not sure it's worth taking the chance," says Mr. Zandi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zandi proposes a hybrid system that is part private and part public. To replace Fannie and Freddie, Mr. Zandi recommends creating between five and 10 privately owned, but government-chartered "mortgage bond insurance companies" that buy eligible loans from banks and issue mortgage-backed securities explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zandi, who co-authored the paper with Cristian deRitis, also of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics, built a steady profile as an influential centrist by providing advice on economic matters to both congressional Democrats and Sen. John McCain's (R., Ariz.) 2008 presidential campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the proposed hybrid system, mortgage originators would sell loans to the mortgage bond insurance companies, or MBICs, which would then bundle those mortgages and issue government-backed securities through a "mortgage securitization facility" similar to Ginnie Mae, a federal corporation that backs payments of principal and interest on securities composed of government-guaranteed loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal facility would require the MBICs to adopt the same form of mortgage security with identical legal structures, terms, and conditions in order to ensure standardization that maximizes liquidity. The MBICs would be required to hold enough capital in reserve to withstand a 25% decline in home prices; by contrast, Fannie and Freddie held just enough capital to withstand a 10% decline in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zandi estimates that under such a model, mortgage rates would be around 0.3 percentage points higher than they were before the mortgage meltdown, largely because the industry was undercapitalized before the financial crisis. Meanwhile, mortgage rates would be around 0.9 percentage points lower than under a fully private market, assuming that private investors would meet similar capital levels and require a 30% return on equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difference in rates "is large enough to have meaningful impacts on the housing market and homeownership," the paper says. Compared with a fully private market, the hybrid model would result in around 375,000 more home sales per year, an 8% gain in median home prices, and an increase of one percentage point in the homeownership rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firms would pay risk-based fees to finance a catastrophic insurance fund managed by a federal regulator, much as the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. insures deposits and handles bank failures. Insurance on mortgage securities "would eliminate runs by scared investors on the global financial system" just as the FDIC has helped avert bank runs during financial panics, says Mr. Zandi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While conservatives have pointed to Canadian and European mortgage markets as possible templates for a private mortgage market, Mr. Zandi says those comparisons aren't particularly useful because "mortgage lending is dominated by the banking system, which is generally very concentrated, and as can be seen in Europe, much too big to fail."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, the financial crisis has ushered in a wave of consolidation that has resulted in the top four U.S. banks controlling more than half of loan origination and servicing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At an industry conference on Monday, a top Republican lawmaker rejected calls for such an approach. "The government's history in pricing risk is extremely poor," said Rep. Scott Garrett (R., N.J.), pointing to the FDIC, the National Flood Insurance Program, and the <span class="companylink">Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp</span>. as three entities with "terrible records of properly pricing for risk."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration's paper isn't expected to offer a single proposal, and instead will outline a set of steps to gradually reduce the government's footprint in the mortgage market along with several options, including a hybrid plan similar to Mr. Zandi's.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite a tough real-estate environment, Virtus Real Estate Securities Fund managed to outperform the broad stock market over the past year by singling out apartments that were poised for improved pricing power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mutual fund (trading symbol: PHRAX), which has just over $1 billion in assets, focuses on real estate in areas with higher barriers to entry, meaning land isn't available for others to build on next door, and where occupancy is rising as the economy recovers. Those two factors are seen by the fund's managers, Geoff Dybas and Frank Haggerty, as an indication that price increases could be on the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And after Messrs. Dybas and Haggerty noticed those factors at some apartments in late 2009, especially in coastal markets including the Northeast, they began raising their exposure to companies that owned those properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We found that the properties we were touring were effectively hanging on to occupancy much more than they normally would," Mr. Dybas said, noting that he and Mr. Haggerty were then expecting the apartments to experience improved pricing power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bet was well-timed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Their decision to increase the weight in apartments back in late 2009 paid off, as that was one of the main drivers of outperformance," said Morningstar analyst Andrew Gogerty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virtus Real Estate Securities Fund has generated a return of 43% over the past 12 months through Friday. In comparison, the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index's total return was 26% over that period. It also outperformed the real-estate category's one-year return of 41%, according to research firm Morningstar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund, which garnered a rating of four out of five stars from Morningstar, has a three-year annualized return of just 1.6%. However, that is better than the S&amp;P 500's total return of 0.5% over that period and the real-estate category's 0.2% three-year annualized return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When evaluating potential investments, the fund first considers broad factors such as supply and demand for each type of real estate, economic data such as gross domestic product and employment, and what people are willing to pay for each type of property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund's managers then look at publicly traded companies within the types of real estate and areas they believe have a better chance at outperforming in that particular economic cycle. Focusing mostly on real-estate investment trusts, or REITs, they explore the management teams, balance sheets and portfolios held by the companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, that analysis showed that operators of apartment complexes, self-storage locations and hotels are among the property types already benefiting from higher occupancy rates that led to price increases, especially in coastal markets such as the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those three specific properties have already seen significant occupancy lifts that have improved pricing power," Mr. Dybas said. He said the fund also is biased toward coastal markets because they historically have benefited from a higher barrier to entry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> and <span class="companylink">Extra Space Storage Inc</span>. are among the fund's top holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"<span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span>, over the last five years, has done an excellent job of increasing its coastal presence and its exposure to the New York region," Mr. Dybas said. He said Extra Space Storage "is benefiting from some of its market positions and has more relative exposure to the Northeast markets such as Boston than some of its peers."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Commercial Real Estate Coming Back, but Unevenly</span>
</div><div class="author">By Anton Troianovski   </div><div>824 words</div><div>7 February 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial property took less of a drubbing than residential real estate in the recession but still faces a long and painful recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks have already taken $80 billion in commercial-real-estate losses—about half of what they are expected to take as a result of the recession, according to the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in some markets, commercial-property values have soared more than 30% from their lows in 2009, according to one industry gauge. For properties such as marquee apartment buildings in New York City and office buildings in Washington, D.C., values are even approaching pre-crash levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, a Washington building that had been the headquarters of the Mortgage Bankers' Association sold for $101 million—just a year after the trade group sold the 10-story building for $41.3 million. Even in hard-hit Atlanta, a major developer closed on a skyscraper last month in a deal that approached values last seen in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, Elizabeth Warren, who headed the congressional panel overseeing the Troubled Asset Relief Program, predicted a "tidal wave of commercial-loan failures." On Friday, at a follow-up hearing on commercial real estate held by the same oversight panel, Patrick Parkinson, a Federal Reserve official, said that "worst-case scenarios are becoming increasingly unlikely."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But commercial-property values aren't climbing uniformly across the country. Many suburbs and smaller cities, especially, are dotted with buildings that are no longer generating enough cash to pay their mortgages. Such problems have been a factor in driving up the delinquency rate on commercial-mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, to a record 9.34%, compared with less than 1% in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many other properties have rebounded in value but are still worth less than their mortgages that were taken out at the height of the boom. Last week, five resorts hobbled by high leverage taken on in 2007 sought bankruptcy protection as about $1.5 billion in debt came due. Among the properties are the Arizona Biltmore hotel in Phoenix and the Doral golf resort in Miami, according to court documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A closer look shows the rise in values doesn't reflect a strong improvement in rents and vacancy rates. In fact, the vacancy rate of the country's four billion square feet of office space is still near a record 18%—a level that translates into about 250 empty Empire State Buildings. Rents have been bouncing along the bottom, according to research firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather, investors are bidding up property values largely because of low interest rates, which have made financing less expensive and made competing income-producing investments, such as bonds, less attractive to yield-hungry investors. In addition, the government has encouraged banks to avoid fire sales and instead work with borrowers to modify bad loans. As a result, the market hasn't been flooded with foreclosed assets for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the availability of financing—the lifeblood of real estate—remains uneven. The volume of new CMBS issues, which plummeted in 2008, will be about $45 billion in the U.S. this year, according to a projection by <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. That is well above last year's $10.9 billion, but far below the $228 billion in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, some warn that an increase in borrowing costs could send values south again. "The minute interest rates go up, the game changes," says Chicago real-estate investor Sam Zell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zell built up the biggest publicly traded empire of office buildings in the history of commercial real estate. In 2007, he sold that company, <span class="companylink">Equity Office Properties Trust</span>, to <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> for $39 billion in the biggest leveraged buyout that real estate had seen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Zell says there's no way he would try to create another national office empire. Rental rates and occupancy will be very competitive for the next four years, he says, and because interest rates are bound to go up eventually, "you're going to have a tough time producing the kind of yield necessary for the cost of capital."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the commercial-real-estate recovery to gain steam, fundamentals such as rents and occupancies have to improve. That means the economy needs to generate more jobs than the 36,000 tally for January. Demand for office, retail and warehouse space will probably remain weak until hiring improves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In top markets, where fundamentals are stronger, investors will likely continue to bid up property values. But stress from the boom-era bingeing will likely take years to work its way through the system. A <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. official, Sandra Thompson, said at Friday's hearing that excessive commercial-real-estate lending, which played a major role in the more than 300 bank failures since early 2008, is still weighing down community banks.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. I'd like to buy a home this spring, and would prefer a new one over a resale. But in the neighborhoods I am interested in, new home prices seem to be going up, while resale homes still seem to be losing value. Why is that, and what, if anything, can I do about it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--San Diego</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The spread between new homes and existing homes is getting wider. The premium that new homes command over existing ones, which averaged 14% over the past two decades, is now double[http://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-bearish-housing-2011-2#the-premium-on-new-homes-is-at-the-highest-level-in-decades-7]that, according to <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>. In fact, the last time it reached this level was in 1991, another tough time for the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main reason for that is, of course, supply. When the housing market tanked in the middle of the last decade, builders put away their shovels and hammers, and focused on unloading their spec houses through giveaways like free finished basements and granite countertops. Those measures worked, and inventory shrank rapidly—in fact, it's now at its lowest level in four decades. According to the latest figures[http://www.census.gov/const/newressales.pdf]from the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2010 the month's supply—that is, the amount of time it would take to sell off the inventory at the current sale pace—fell to 6.9 months in December from 9.1 months in August. Meanwhile, the supply of existing homes grew, swelled by foreclosures and short sales. Consequently, the new home supply as the percentage of total supply, which hovered around 15% in the early 1990s, is now roughly half that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So now it's getting harder to find builders who are giving away incentives, and, as you've discovered, many are holding firm on their prices, or even raising them. The Census Bureau projects that the median new home sales price for December was $241,500, up from 8.5% from a year earlier. Meanwhile, according to the National Association of Realtors, the median existing home[http://www.realtor.org/press_room/news_releases/2011/01/sharp_rise]price dropped 1% year-over-year to $168,800 in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those are the economic facts, and there's not much you can do about them—except wait. Although home builders have been occupying themselves during the Great Recession by buying land; raising new capital; and creating subsidiaries to do remodeling or to buy and sell distressed properties, soon they will have to start building again. For the best deals, concentrate your searches on big new developments where builders face a lot of competition; or conversely, on tiny infill enclaves in up-and-coming area where the competition is mainly from more modestly priced resale homes. Another tip: Either buy early, preferably pre-groundbreaking, when builders hold their grand-opening sales, or late, when they offer close-out specials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And finally, if you can't find a new home you like and can afford, consider that in some neighborhoods, prices have come down so much that you can buy an existing home for less than its replacement cost. If you find such a deal, you can either renovate it or tear it down and build a new one, as your finances permit.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown   </div><div>706 words</div><div>1 February 2011</div><div>20:24</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate investors hunting for distress are getting a crack at a different kind of FDIC auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly two years after the failure of Georgia-based <span class="companylink">Silverton Bank</span>, the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. is seeking to unload from its books a $385 million set of mortgages tied to 45 hotels once held by the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the FDIC has been no stranger to loan sales—it sold 15 mortgage portfolios last year, including another set of loans formerly owned by Silverton—there is a twist to this package.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, the agency only sells off a stake in the portfolio, remaining a partner that also provides 0% financing. This time, the agency is trying to sell the loans in an all-cash deal, without financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't clear why the FDIC is pursuing the all-cash strategy, but the new approach could swing pricing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the FDIC won't be a partner, buyers won't be scared off by the rigorous reporting requirements that come with partnering with the agency, potentially driving up interest, says Thomas Galli, an attorney with <span class="companylink">Greenberg Traurig</span> who has represented numerous winning bidders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then again, buyers will have to get their own financing, at a higher cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's anyone's guess to where the pricing will come out," Mr. Galli says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, hotel rooms in the Dallas-Fort Worth area booked through <span class="companylink">Expedia Inc</span>. for this Sunday night are an average of 98% higher than for the same Sunday in that market a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">Priceline.com Inc</span>., rooms have gone for an average of $103.64, up 74% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means the Dallas-area premium for Super Bowl XLV is lower than what was recorded in three of the four previous host cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the biggest Super Bowl premium in recent years, rates in Detroit for Super Bowl XL in 2006 averaged $208.53, up 196% from a year earlier in that market, according to <span class="companylink">Smith Travel Research</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only recent host city to see a lower rate premium than that projected for Dallas is Miami last year, which notched a 90.3% boost for Super Bowl XLIV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why the small premium in Big D? Dallas isn't as much of a resort city as most of the others, and the still-soft economy likely is a factor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late hotel bookers on Tuesday could still get an $809 suite at Hawthorn Suites three miles from the stadium or a $195 room at a Super 8 motel seven miles away.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many Americans, Roger Staubach thinks he knows who will win the Super Bowl. Like not so many Americans, Mr. Staubach says his analysis is based on comparative office-building vacancies in Green Bay and Pittsburgh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can mark my word: the Packers will prevail," says Mr. Staubach, who led the Dallas Cowboys to two Super Bowl victories in the 1970s and later became a real-estate tycoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Staubach's word was relayed in a press release by <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Inc</span>., the commercial-real-estate brokerage where he serves as executive chairman of the Americas. The company says that teams based in cities with a higher percentage of vacant office space have won the Super Bowl "nearly two-thirds of the time since 2000."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That trend would hand the title to the Packers of Green Bay, Wisc., (office vacancy: 18.9%) over the Steelers of Pittsburgh (office vacancy: 12.1%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeremy Kronman, a broker in Pittsburgh for <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> rival <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group Inc</span>., wasn't impressed with his competitor's forecast. His reasoning for why the Steelers will win: Some of the healthiest office markets in the country—New York City, San Francisco, and Pittsburgh—are also home to three of the most successful Super Bowl teams.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The distribution-space giant being formed by the megamerger of <span class="companylink">ProLogis</span> and <span class="companylink">AMB Property Corp</span>. already is looking at Europe as a major stomping ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">ProLogis</span> and AMB, the biggest publicly traded warehouse owners based in the U.S., announced a merger agreement on Monday that will establish a landlord with some 600 million square feet of industrial real-estate space on four continents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a rationale for the merger, scheduled to close in the second quarter, company executives didn't just promise cost savings, but also a larger global operation that is more attractive to multinational corporations, from logistics providers like <span class="companylink">Deutsche Post AG</span>'s DHL to consumer-oriented companies like <span class="companylink">Unilever</span>. These firms need real estate around the world as part of their global distribution chains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The merger here hinges on size being an advantage in the industrial real-estate sector," says Green Street Advisors analyst Steven Frankel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">ProLogis</span>, brokers and analysts say, was one of the first developers to build modern, large-scale distribution facilities across Europe. AMB's foothold in key northern countries like Germany and the Netherlands, and <span class="companylink">ProLogis</span>'s significant presence throughout Europe, will create a dominant landlord handling 145 million square feet of owned and managed warehouse space, worth $13 billion, according to the companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in Europe, size doesn't guarantee success. A nascent recovery in the warehouse market has been clouded by the impact of sovereign-debt problems on the European economy. There also is increasing competition from other large landlords, such as British property company <span class="companylink">Segro PLC</span> and Australia's <span class="companylink">Goodman Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, <span class="companylink">ProLogis</span>'s competitors have been looking for ways to seize market share from the global giant, says James Markby, a European industrial real-estate broker for <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group Inc</span>. The merger could make that harder if the new company can use its increased global presence to attract tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's an increasingly international, integrated global market," Mr. Markby says. "If DHL has a requirement in a country, it's far easier for them … to go to someone that's built them their specification warehouse before."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the merger, which still needs shareholder approval, the company will be based in AMB's hometown of San Francisco. Starting in 2013, it will be run by AMB chief Hamid Moghadam as the sole chief executive officer. Since the merger was announced on Monday, Mr. Moghadam and Walter Rakowich, who will be co-CEOs until the end of 2012, have repeatedly cast the deal as a way to attract global clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The offering that we expect to give to our customers, our repeat multinational customers, will be second to none," Mr. Rakowich said in a conference call with analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some industrial brokers in Europe report a pickup last year in requests for "build-to-suit" warehouses, which developers build based on the specifications of clients who have agreed to a lease. Mr. Markby said two of his company's clients, logistics companies <span class="companylink">Kuehne &amp; Nagel International AG</span> and DHL, are looking for build-to-suit deals across Europe. Neither company responded to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the outlook for industrial real estate in Europe remains mixed. Demand for warehouse space is closely tied to the economy and consumer spending, which have been clouded by fiscal problems across the Continent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany's looking good</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany was the second-most attractive offshore growth market for U.S. companies last year, behind only India, as Europe's largest national economy continued to shake off the worst of the financial crisis and drew investors seeking access to its deep labor markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to property-services group <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, Germany joined the so-called BRIC countries—Brazil, Russia, India, China—as key destinations for U.S. corporations looking to expand in 2010 and 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Clearly a lot of companies see Germany as the only economy which remained very robust through the financial crisis," says Thierry Delvaux, managing director of JLL's International Desk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said many U.S. corporations were bullish on the emerging BRIC markets because of the higher returns offered by those higher-risk markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But Germany is one of the key countries around the world where the return is pretty high and risk is pretty low because it is a mature economy that has proved itself, particularly through these past few years," Mr. Delvaux says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country's advanced labor force and "quality production facilities" were also major drawing cards, according to JLL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, the most recent year that data is available, there was $116.8 billion of U.S. direct investment in Germany. Pharmaceutical, high-tech companies and law firms engaged in mergers and acquisitions were among the fastest-growing U.S. operations in Germany last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Brightpoint Inc</span>., which helps cellphone makers manage their supply chains, is one of the U.S. companies considering expansion in Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We view Germany as a key hub … for servicing most neighboring countries including [the] Benelux region and France," says Mr. Anurag Gupta, president of Europe, the Middle East and Africa for <span class="companylink">Brightpoint</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Delvaux says Germany is expected to remain highlyattractive to U.S. investors, but that China would be the biggest growth market in coming years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold rush in prime London real estate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime London commercial real estate has emerged as an improbable postcrisis safe haven. Despite the U.K.'s precarious economic situation, international investors poured more than 6 billion euros ($8.17 billion) into London offices and stores in the 18 months to June 2010, almost as much capital as the next nine most popular cities combined, according to CBRE. Having fallen 50% from its peak, City offices have outstripped every other European market, up 25%, and compared with a mere 2% gain in Paris, according to <span class="companylink">Investment Property Databank</span>. But with some West End offices now changing hands at yields as low as 4%, global real-estate investors can find better value elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For property investors, London's appeal lies in its perception as a reliable store of value. International investors value its transparency and liquidity. Access to deals is open, unlike parts of Europe and Asia, where foreign investors are often shut out of the bidding or where legal protections are weak -- making it hard to deploy capital. Investors are also attracted to its relative stability: Average leases on U.K. offices at 7.5 years are more than two years longer than in Germany. Prime London property is relatively decoupled from the fortunes of the U.K. economy and boosted by the pound's weakness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But asset prices have started to become divorced from the fundamentals. London West End offices yield just 4.25% and City offices, 5.25% -- close to the peak of the boom levels. True, 10-year gilt yields have fallen since then to 3.6%, but interest rates are likely to rise next year and rental growth is uncertain. London City office rents fell in real terms by 4.2% over the past decade, a steeper decline than in Frankfurt and Paris, according to IPD. Further, U.K. banks hold billions of pounds of secondary commercial real estate, which they may start unloading in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, what should investors do? Within London, the smart money is now focused on new developments, betting the supply of inward investment will remain strong, while the supply of investment opportunities will remain weak. The pipeline of new office developments is running at less than half of the 25-year average. That also means there is likely to be a shortage of new office space available in 2014, when a large volume of long-term City leases start expiring. <span class="companylink">Land Securities</span>, which is planning to start development on four London sites this year, is forecasting unleveraged returns of at least 14% on these ventures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other European markets now look more enticing: German shopping centers are benefiting from the strongest consumer outlook since reunification and yield 5.5%-6.5%. Investors also point to Paris offices, where the recovery has been slower. Swedish property, buoyed by an economy that grew 5.5% last year, also looks like a good value. With London an increasingly crowded trade, expect to see more international capital flow to these markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Renee Schultes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil explorers' stocks show some froth</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller European exploration and production outfits may offer investors a more exciting alternative than sluggish oil majors. Stocks like <span class="companylink">Tullow Oil</span> and <span class="companylink">Cairn Energy</span> have soared on strong production growth, high oil prices and optimism over their ability to make exciting new discoveries. But the excitement has got out of hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The appeal of the E&amp;P minnows is clear: Cairn increased daily production by 70% in 2010; Tullow is forecasting a 53% uptick this year. European oil majors, by contrast, will mostly see low single-digit production growth in 2011, a legacy of relatively low exploration investment over the past decade. The smaller E&amp;P companies -- Tullow is one-tenth of BP's size -- also see more relative share-price benefit from new discoveries than larger rivals, which struggle to find projects sizeable enough to shift the dial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But E&amp;P company valuations also reflect this success and add in a large dollop of faith in either future exploration success or markedly higher oil prices too. Assuming an oil price of $80 a barrel, Tullow's oil fields in actual production or development have a net asset value per share of 868 pence, according to Bernstein Research, while its shares trade at 1,351 pence; <span class="companylink">Premier Oil</span>'s NAV per share is 1,308 pence against a 2,105-pence share price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These premiums leave E&amp;P stocks vulnerable to negative news around new projects. Heritage Oil's share price dropped 31% last week after it said new reserves in Iraq are mostly lowly-valued natural gas, rather than oil. At current valuations, the potential upside for investors from new discoveries is slim: even if all of Tullow's exploration comes good, its NAV per share would be only 12% higher than the current share price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hopes of takeover activity may be supporting investment sentiment, buoyed by Korea National Oil's purchase of <span class="companylink">Dana Petroleum</span> last year. But that deal valued Dana around $12 per barrel of oil equivalent of proved and probable reserves, in line with average deal prices in 2010. <span class="companylink">Premier Oil</span>, Dana's closest equivalent, now trades 33% above that valuation. Cooler heads should take profits.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed hoards</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$1 trillion</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">in Treasurys</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Federal Reserve has passed yet another milestone on its journey into uncharted territory: Its average holdings of longer-term Treasurys have passed the $1 trillion mark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prior to the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve tended to hold as much as $700 billion in Treasury securities, two-thirds of which typically had terms that were longer than a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But thanks largely to its $600 billion bond-buying program, left unchanged at the U.S. central bank's meeting last week, Treasury holdings have ballooned. Earlier in January, total Treasury holdings, including short-term bills, passed the $1 trillion mark. Last week, the Federal Reserve's holdings of longer-term U.S. debt, notes and bonds -- those with a term of more than a year -- averaged $1.022 trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And even if the central bank's bond-buying program ends as planned in June, the Federal Reserve may have to keep purchasing significant amounts of Treasury securities for some time. If it did nothing, about $200 billion to $300 billion in Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities would mature annually starting in 2012, estimates Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would amount to a de-facto tightening of monetary policy, which could pose challenges should the recovery again sputter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors will also have to consider other possibilities. Should inflation become a threat, the Federal Reserve might be forced to sell some of its holdings. That was one option noted in a speech earlier this month by Fed Vice Chairman Janet Yellen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But any indication that the central bank could begin selling would likely roil bond markets as investors try to beat it to the exit. The bigger its portfolio of longer-term Treasury holdings, the greater that worry becomes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overheard: Dubai Rebound</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years after finding itself in the teeth of the credit crisis, Dubai is back. At least on one measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Jumeirah Group, one of the Gulf state's leading hotel operators, revenue per available room over the holiday period was back above the highs reached in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gerald Lawless, executive chairman of the group, which has 2,600 rooms at hotels in Dubai, including the famous Burj Al Arab, told The Wall Street Journal in Davos that holiday celebrators from the U.K., Germany and Russia helped underpin the rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenues per room remain somewhat volatile, but they dropped by about a quarter during the credit crisis, which had caused financial distress in highly leveraged Dubai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other nationality of travelers that Mr. Lawless is looking to for a boost: Chinese celebrating the coming New Year.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developer Joseph Moinian has cut a deal to fend off a hostile takeover attempt by one of the city's largest developers, who sought to seize his 26-story office building project near Columbus Circle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, real estate mogul Stephen Ross, the developer of the nearby <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> Center, made a grab for Mr. Moinian's 3 Columbus Circle project by purchasing the in-default $250 million debt on the property. Mr. Ross's plan was to foreclose on and demolish the troubled office project and redevelop the property with luxury condominiums and Nordstrom as its anchor tenant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Moinian blocked that late last week by buying the mortgage back with help from another major New York City owner, <span class="companylink">SL Green Realty Corp</span>. A partnership of Mr. Moinian and SL Green paid a venture of Mr. Ross's Related Cos. and <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> about $278 million to relinquish control of the $250 million mortgage, according to people familiar with the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transaction puts to rest a battle of the titans that had been closely watched by the New York City real estate industry. Mr. Ross, clearly the more powerful of the two, has projects everywhere from Los Angeles to Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Moinian, who was one of New York's most active investors during the boom years, was determined to hold onto the property. An Iranian immigrant who got his first job here working in a Queens restaurant, he surprised the industry with his success in restructuring over-leveraged properties during the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Columbus Circle project, formerly 1775 Broadway, was one of his prize projects. He has spent about $100 million to upgrade it, including a new glass skin for the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moinian's victory was only possible because the Manhattan office property has been outperforming other markets as it recovers from the recession. The deal values the 700,000-square-foot property at about $500 million, well above its $350 million appraised value from early 2006, when Mr. Moinian took out the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SL Green, which will be putting in more than $130 million in fresh equity, will share control of the building with Mr. Moinian, who will own slightly more than half of the property, people familiar with the deal said.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, when Mr. Ross's group bought the mortgage, he was betting that Mr. Moinian would be unable to raise the funds to engineer a rescue.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For months before Mr. Ross took control of the 3 Columbus Circle loan, he did extensive preparation, hatching plans for the new building in secret, and soliciting proposals for designs from top world architecture firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The struggle with Mr. Moinian soon toppled into court. Mr. Ross tried to foreclose, and Mr. Moinian sued Related, alleging that it was trying to "steal" the building.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the state's rent regulations set to sunset in June, the Assembly's Democratic majority is firing an opening shot in what is typically a high-profile legislative fight over the future of New York City's approximately 1 million rent-stabilized apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, whose chamber is allied with advocates for greater rent regulation, is vowing not to extend a recently expired tax break popular with developers unless it is tied to a substantial strengthening of the rent laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax break is known as "421-A" and it expired in December. It abates property taxes on new residential development and is credited with spurring construction on thousands of new apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I just fundamentally believe we shouldn't be extending a tax break for big developers without making sure we are strengthening protections for the tenants who live in their buildings," Mr. Silver said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gambit by the Democrats comes as they face a year when they will likely be forced to cut popular social programs given budget gaps. They are seeking to boost the strength of their political hand on the rent-regulation issue, a top priority for the liberal conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for the Senate Republican majority, which traditionally has been allied with—and supported financially by—the real estate industry, declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York's rent laws have been in effect for decades but they need to be renewed periodically. Their renewal often turns into a major legislative battle, as landlords pour resources into campaign accounts in attempts to weaken laws or fend off added regulations, some of which they say could cost the industry billions in lost value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twice in the 1990s, landlords and Senate Republicans expanded the ability of owners to convert rent-regulated apartments to more-lucrative market-rate units. Since then, tenants have fought unsuccessfully to put in place meaningful limits on landlords' abilities to deregulate apartments. Tenant groups have noted that the stock of regulated housing is diminishing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Assembly Democrats this year aim to at least maintain their ground, if not make gains that curtail landlords' ability to deregulate apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, under current law, the lowest monthly rent at which a landlord can convert a vacant regulated apartment to market rate is $2,000 a month. Democrats are trying to raise that amount, which has stayed the same for nearly two decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gov. Andrew Cuomo hasn't articulated a position on the extension of rent regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without linking 421-A to rent rules, the Democrats would be in a weak position given that the sunset of rent regulations would allow landlords to dramatically raise rents on stabilized apartments. It's unclear whether the real estate industry would ultimately be willing to trade an extension of rent regulations for the 421-A tax break.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the leaders of the two top industry groups—the Real Estate Board of New York and the Rent Stabilization Association—say they are against a deal that ties the tax break with an extension of rent regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's their gambit—to try to create leverage that they'll find doesn't exist," says Joe Strasburg, president of the Rent Stabilization Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board, said he is considering endorsing a temporary extension of the tax break that would expire in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless of whether the play works, going forward Assembly Democrats say they plan to link other pieces of legislation sought by Senate Republicans to the rent regulation extension.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It would be my expectation that we are going to ask the conference to tie whatever is left" to a rent rule extension, says Vito Lopez, chairman of the Assembly's housing committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords acknowledge that the likelihood of a complete elimination of rent rules is low given their popularity. Industry leaders haven't yet publicly said what they hope to gain from this year's negotiations.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown and Lingling Wei   </div><div>851 words</div><div>31 January 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developer Joseph Moinian has cut a deal to fend off a hostile takeover attempt by one of the city's largest developers, who sought to seize his 26-story office building project near Columbus Circle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, real estate mogul Stephen Ross, the developer of the nearby <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> Center, made a grab for Mr. Moinian's 3 Columbus Circle project by purchasing the in-default $250 million debt on the property. Mr. Ross's plan was to foreclose on and demolish the troubled office project and redevelop the property with luxury condominiums and Nordstrom as its anchor tenant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Moinian blocked that late last week by buying the mortgage back with help from another major New York City owner, <span class="companylink">SL Green Realty Corp</span>. A partnership of Mr. Moinian and SL Green paid a venture of Mr. Ross's Related Cos. and <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> about $278 million to relinquish control of the $250 million mortgage, according to people familiar with the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transaction puts to rest a battle of the titans that had been closely watched by the New York City real estate industry. Mr. Ross, clearly the more powerful of the two, has projects everywhere from Los Angeles to Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Moinian, who was one of New York's most active investors during the boom years, was determined to hold onto the property. An Iranian immigrant who got his first job here working in a Queens restaurant, he surprised the industry with his success in restructuring over-leveraged properties during the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Columbus Circle project, formerly 1775 Broadway, was one of his prize projects. He has spent about $100 million to upgrade it, including a new glass skin for the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moinian's victory was only possible because the Manhattan office property has been outperforming other markets as it recovers from the recession. The deal values the 700,000-square-foot property at about $500 million, well above its $350 million appraised value from early 2006, when Mr. Moinian took out the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SL Green, which will be putting in more than $130 million in fresh equity, will share control of the building with Mr. Moinian, who will own slightly more than half of the property, people familiar with the deal said. The fresh capital will enable the new venture to spend money on interior work and brokerage commissions to lease up the property, which was practically emptied by Mr. Moinian when he redeveloped it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, when Mr. Ross's group bought the mortgage, he was betting that Mr. Moinian would be unable to raise the funds to engineer a rescue. With Mr. Moinian scrambling to resolve debt woes on his portfolio of office buildings, the gamble seemed a good one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For months before Mr. Ross took control of the 3 Columbus Circle loan, he did extensive preparation, hatching plans for the new building in secret, and soliciting proposals for designs from top world architecture firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The struggle with Mr. Moinian soon toppled into court. Mr. Ross tried to foreclose, and Mr. Moinian sued Related, alleging that it was trying to "steal" the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In settlement talks, Mr. Ross offered to give Mr. Moinian a large payment for control of the building, in addition to offering him an equity stake in the new tower, people familiar with the discussions said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the fall, SL Green came riding to the rescue, offering to help Mr. Moinian fend off Mr. Ross. One of the city's largest office landlords, SL Green has been on a buying spree in an attempt to take advantage of relatively low values.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New claims for jobless benefits rose last week and orders for durable goods fell in December, according to reports Thursday indicating the struggle of an economy trying to gather steam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More data showed a modest revival in housing demand as the battered building sector that was a factor in sending the economy into recession attempts to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department reported the number of idled U.S. workers filing new claims for benefits rose by 51,000 to 454,000 in the week ended Jan. 22. Analysts said the data were likely distorted by winter weather and think new claims will resume a downward course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week moving average for claims, designed to smooth out volatility, increased 15,750 to 428,750.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This jump in the number of new filers is likely to prove temporary and should reverse next week," RBS Economics Research said in a note to clients. "Since early October, the four-week average in initial claims has been trending firmly to the downside, and we see no reason to suspect that that trajectory has changed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, while the U.S. labor market is gradually improving as the 18-month-old economic recovery gains momentum, it will take a long time to make up for all the jobs lost during the 2007-09 recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Despite some improvement, the labor markets remain relatively soft," Insight Economics analyst Steven Wood wrote in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Continuing claims for unemployment benefits, those drawn by Americans jobless for more than one week, rose 94,000 to 4 million for the week ending Jan. 15, according to the Labor Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said orders for manufactured durable goods, which are designed to last at least three years, fell 2.5% last month from November to a seasonally adjusted $191 billion. The drop was driven by a sharp decline in aircraft orders, however. After stripping out transportation, new orders rose 0.5% last month. Some economists raised their estimates for fourth-quarter gross domestic product on the basis of the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report suggested that business investment continued to improve last month as well. A closely followed proxy for capital spending—orders for capital goods, excluding aircraft and defense orders—rose 1.4% in December. That followed a 3.1% increase in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shipments of manufactured goods, meanwhile, ticked up 1.4% to $200.4 billion. There were signs that business investment continued to improve last month as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A measure of demand for capital goods that excludes aircraft and defense orders and gauges business spending rose 1.4% in December. That follows a 3.1% increase in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for homes firmed in December, the National Association of Realtors said in a separate report Thursday, as its index of pending home sales increased for the fifth time in six months. The pending home sales index, which is based on signed housing contracts and is an indicator of future sales, rose 2% to 93.7 in December.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Alan Zibel and Sara Murray   </div><div>408 words</div><div>27 January 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales in the U.S. surged last month but 2010 was still the worst year on record for the battered home-building industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales increased by 17.5% in December, compared with the previous month, rising to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 329,000 new homes, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That wasn't enough to turn around a notably bad year. For all of 2010, the government estimated that about 321,000 homes were sold -- the lowest tally on records dating back to 1963 -- as joblessness and foreclosures continued to weigh on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December's strength was driven by surging sales in the West, which rose 71.9%, and were likely inflated by a rush to take advantage of a homebuyer tax credit in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"New-home sales are bouncing around the bottom," said Ian Shepherdson, a <span class="companylink">High Frequency Economics Ltd</span>. analyst. "Ultimately, we think a sustained acceleration in payrolls will be the key driver of stronger demand for new property, so we think the second half of this year will be a good deal better than the first."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home sales ended the year on an encouraging note, total sales in 2010 were 14.2% lower than in 2009. Compared with December 2009, new home sales last month were 7.6% lower.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales in the U.S. surged last month but 2010 was still the worst year on record for the battered homebuilding industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales increased by 17.5% in December, compared with the previous month, rising to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 329,000 new homes, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That wasn't enough to turn around a notably bad year. For all of 2010, the government estimated that about 321,000 homes were sold—the lowest tally on records dating back to 1963—as joblessness and foreclosures continue to weigh on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December's strength was driven by surging sales in the West, which rose 71.9%, and were likely inflated by a rush to take advantage of a homebuyer tax credit in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"New-home sales are bouncing around the bottom," said Ian Shepherdson, a <span class="companylink">High Frequency Economics Ltd</span>. analyst. "Ultimately, we think a sustained acceleration in payrolls will be the key driver of stronger demand for new property, so we think the second half of this year will be a good deal better than the first."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home sales ended the year on an encouraging note, total sales in 2010 were 14.2% lower than in 2009. Compared with December 2009, new home sales last month were 7.6% lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices also firmed last month. The median sales price for a new home sold in December was $241,500, up 8.5% from the same month a year ago. A jump in sales of higher-priced homes in the West may have been behind the increase, which analysts don't expect to last.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After losing more than $10 billion on real-estate investments, Calpers, the giant California pension fund, is returning to the property market with a new strategy and fewer investment managers, seeking steady, modest gains rather than blockbuster returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After investing relatively small amounts in real estate during the past two years, the $226 billion <span class="companylink">California Public Employees' Retirement System</span> is gearing up to commit as much as $2 billion to property deals in 2011, the fund said. Calpers will be making those investments with less assistance from some big-name managers, including <span class="companylink">BlackRock Inc</span>., Hines Interests and <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Inc</span>., which it removed from overseeing parts of its portfolio in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of a "searching re-examination" of its $15 billion real-estate program conducted since the financial crisis, Calpers has decided to increasingly rely on property as a source of steady income, rather than seeking to take advantage of increases in value, Chief Investment Officer Joe Dear said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dear said Calpers wasn't planning any significant new commitments to real-estate private-equity funds, which were popular with pension funds in the past decade because the vehicles allowed them to quickly ramp up their exposure to property around the world. Instead, Calpers will be looking to commit more capital to "separate accounts" -- property portfolios managed by real-estate companies specifically on behalf of Calpers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a tough criticism of the real-estate funds, Mr. Dear said they "tend to be more in the asset-gathering, fee-generating businesses than they are in the capital appreciation, income-generating business."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calpers also has culled its stable of investment managers, in recent months removing some household real-estate names as managers of portions of its portfolio and replacing them with smaller, less well-known companies such as CommonWealth Partners LLC, <span class="companylink">GI Partners</span> and GID Investment Advisers LLC. Mr. Dear said the investment managers who received more capital "all exercised exceptional discipline during the bubble -- that is, they were selling assets rather than buying."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BlackRock and global commercial-property firm <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> had no comment. A Hines spokesman acknowledged that the Houston-based real-estate developer generated poor returns for Calpers over the past two years. But he said that annual returns as measured by Hines averaged 10.7% over the 12-year life of the Calpers joint venture and pointed out that Hines is still managing some of the pension fund's real-estate investments around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calpers's new strategy -- set to be discussed in a board meeting as early as next month -- signals a broad swing toward more conservative real-estate investing among U.S. pension funds and points to continuing turmoil in a real-estate industry that in the last decade saw pension funds emerge as an increasingly important source of equity capital and fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more conservative strategy means borrowing less money to buy property and acquiring higher-quality, well-leased buildings. During the boom years, Calpers, like many other big investors, sought profits on risky land deals and boosted its real-estate returns with increasing amounts of debt, generating annual returns as high as 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That strategy had disastrous consequences when the recession hit. Calpers's real-estate portfolio lost nearly half of its value, or more than $10 billion, from July 2008 to June 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calpers's soured investments included those made in such high-profile deals as the Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village apartment complex in Manhattan, and a venture called LandSource, which held California land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We decided to reduce the risk in the real-estate portfolio and increase its income orientation as a risk mitigator," Mr. Dear said. "The risk in the real-estate portfolio increased steadily as the bubble expanded, and the consequence was substantial capital loss."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those losses finally appear to be abating. Last week, Calpers reported its smallest real-estate loss since the financial crisis: a decline of 5% in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calpers's moves come as public-employee pension funds across the country grapple with how to ride the real-estate market's recovery while avoiding mistakes made during the boom. Those decisions will carry broad implications as cash-strapped funds look for ways to make good on their promises to workers without having to ask taxpayers for more money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Efforts by Calpers to reduce real-estate risk carry potential drawbacks of their own: Many other big investors are flocking to conservative real-estate deals, driving up prices for the best property, known as "core" real estate around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dear said he was concerned about the widespread interest in core property.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To impress investors, retailers need a talent for unloading merchandise. But these days, they might make a bigger splash selling real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney</span> leapt 7.2% Monday after the department-store chain announced a slew of store closures and appointed real-estate heavyweights William Ackman and Steven Roth to its board.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These stock moves are a reminder many older retailers are actually big real-estate plays. <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>'s Bill Dreher recently estimated Dillard's property is worth 80% of the company's market capitalization.

Tax laws make it difficult for a company to spin off real estate to existing shareholders, says Barnet Phillips, retired partner from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom. Instead, a company may need to sell shares of a REIT to new investors. In turn, the REIT would be run in the interest of all shareholders, not just the retailer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That conflict likely explains why REIT spinoffs have been rare. Valuable as Penney's property looks on paper, Messrs. Ackman and Roth have their work cut out for them getting full credit for it.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Building Seeks New Gloss; Former Home of Madoff Empire, the Lipstick Is Reaching for Its Former Heights</span>
</div><div class="author">By Dana Rubinstein   </div><div>1103 words</div><div>24 January 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new landlords of the Lipstick Building are confident that its reputation won't be smeared by its most infamous tenant, Bernard Madoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Argentina's largest landlord and the brothers who founded retailer Guess teamed up late last year to take control of the troubled 636,000-square-foot office tower on Third Avenue. They already are putting a positive spin on the Madoff connection. Before collapsing, Mr. Madoff's firm occupied 51,600 square feet, or about 8% of building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When he was big, Madoff had his choice of all the buildings in the city, and he chose this building," says Daniel Elsztain, a third-generation member of an Argentine family that controls millions of square feet of office buildings, cattle ranches, malls, hotels and apartment buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Elsztain and Paul and Maurice Marciano, who founded Guess in 1981, had minority positions in the Philip Johnson-designed elliptical skyscraper at 885 Third Avenue. But, by putting in fresh capital, they took control in one of the many debt restructurings that are taking place throughout New York as the commercial-property market recovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal valued the property at about $395 million, or about $620 a square foot, according to people with knowledge of the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That valuation shows that the New York market still has a ways to go before it reaches the lofty valuations of the prerecession years. The previous landlord of the building, Haim Revah, paid $648.5 million, according to published reports, or about $1,000 a square foot, for it in 2007. Mr. Revah didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building is still 92.5% occupied. One tenant, law firm <span class="companylink">Latham &amp; Watkins</span>, leases 403,930 square feet, or 65% of the Lipstick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lipstick restructuring demonstrates that the city's commercial real estate sales market is rebounding faster and stronger than those in most of the rest of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This type of multiparty solution would have been bogged down in 2009 with mispricing, and impatience, and an overall inability for both sides to gamble on bold moves," says Douglas Harmon of Eastdil Secured, who, with Adam Spies, represented the main mortgage holder, the <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span>, in the restructuring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the reasons New York's market is rebounding is the deep bench of well-capitalized investors like the Marcianos and Mr. Elsztain who are eager to own a piece of what many regard as the Mecca of American real estate. The three investors all own less prestigious properties here, but in taking control of the Lipstick Building they're making their biggest splash so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, this is a city that tends to put the past behind quickly. Right after the Madoff scandal erupted, brokers warned that tenants, especially other hedge funds, wouldn't want to locate in the space in which Mr. Madoff ran the biggest Ponzi scheme in history. The Federal Bureau of Investigation stills pays month-to-month for 9,889 square feet that formerly housed Bernard Madoff Investment Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some of the other Madoff space is now occupied by Muriel Siebert &amp; Co. and Surge Trading, which bought the Madoff trading operations. The new landlords plan to continue marketing the rest of the Madoff space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fate of the red granite Lipstick Building, which got its name from its three-tiered, telescoping design, has mirrored the ups and downs of New York's real estate market. Completed in 1986 by Texan developer Hines, it was sold in 2004 to a group led by Tishman Speyer that paid $235 million, or about $400 a square foot. Three years later, Tishman made an enormous profit by selling it to Mr. Revah for $648.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That transaction had a complicated financing structure that was typical of the boom years. Mr. Revah funded the acquisition with a $210 million first mortgage from the <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span>. He also sold the ground beneath the property to SL Green, agreeing to a ground lease with rapidly rising rent payments. In addition, he sold minority equity interests in the property to people like Mr. Elsztain and the Marciano brothers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many buyers during the boom years, Mr. Revah bought with the expectation that rents would continue rising. But when the downturn hit, rents fell, making it harder for the building to make its mortgage payments. By 2010, Mr. Revah's real-estate group, Metropolitan Real Estate Investors, had defaulted on its mortgage from <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span>, whose new team went on to hire Eastdil Secured to market the loan, according to court records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This put Mr. Elsztain and the Marcianos in a bind. If the bank or someone else foreclosed, their investment would likely be wiped out. So they told the bank they would be interested in putting in fresh capital. That led to months of negotiations and, finally, last month's restructuring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the deal, Mr. Elsztain and the Marcianos are putting in $15 million of fresh capital, and are increasing their stakes to 49% and 42% respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In exchange, the bank agreed to write down its debt of $210 million to $130 million, and to use the $15 million to further pay down the note, according to people familiar with the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span> didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that the dust has settled, Mr. Elsztain says the venture plans to reposition the property. It has hired Gerard Nocera, of Herald Square Properties, who is now interviewing architecture firms about redesigning the building's lobby to, "maybe move it from the mid 1980s to the 2011 era," Mr. Nocera says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also plan to make a push to lease up some of the building's empty space, something that should be easier to do now that it has reduced its debt and doesn't need such high rents. "Over the past few years, it has slipped off its top perch, due to cash flow issues," Mr. Nocera says. "Now with positive cash flow again, the building will be able to right itself."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, both the Marcianos and Mr. Elzstain are considering other opportunities in New York City, a market they consider a sound investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We believe strongly in the recovery of the New York economy," says William Payne, the chief investment officer for Marciano Investment Group LLC, the Guess brothers' private-investment group.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're like most Americans, you probably figure the news about Steve Jobs and Apple doesn't affect you directly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, you're probably concerned for Mr. Jobs's well-being. (The Apple CEO, who has a history of medical problems, is taking an indefinite leave for unspecified health reasons.) And you may take a general interest in news about the leadership of one of America's most prominent and successful companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But you may nonetheless think, "This doesn't have anything to do with me. I don't work for Apple. It's not going to affect my iPhone, iPad or MacBook. I don't hold any Apple stock in my portfolio."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You may not know it, but you are probably a secret Apple stockholder. Maybe a big one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few stocks are as widely held in regular mutual funds as well as in hedge funds. Few affect the performance of so many retirement portfolios. This is especially unusual because Apple is such a volatile growth stock. In recent years it has fallen by two-thirds and it has quadrupled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a review of company filings I conducted using FactSet, a market data provider, an astonishing 4,100 mutual funds hold stock in Apple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And many of the funds holding Apple are making very big bets on the stock on your behalf: More than 750 of them have invested at least 5% of their entire portfolio in this one stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They include some very well-known and widely held funds. The <span class="companylink">Fidelity Contrafund</span> held more than $5.7 billion in Apple stock at the last count, 7.5% of the portfolio. <span class="companylink">Fidelity Growth Company</span> fund held another $2.2 billion, or 5.7% of assets. <span class="companylink">T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth</span> fund has 8% of investors' money in Apple. <span class="companylink">Janus Fund</span>: 5.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apple makes up 10% of the <span class="companylink">iShares Morningstar Large Growth Index</span> exchange-traded fund, 14% of the iShares Dow Jones US Technology Sector Index ETF. The Janus Twenty fund had nearly 11% of its money in Apple at the end of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apple alone accounts for more than one-fifth of the widely followed Nasdaq 100 Index, which you can invest in through the widely-held PowerShares QQQ Trust fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So if your U.S. stock portfolio is up over the past few years, and especially last year, Apple's remarkable performance probably has something to do with it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With housing prices still depressed and interest rates low, should you buy a retirement home even if you're years away from living in it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many people, the scenario works like this: Stop working, sell your current home, buy a retirement home. But these days, many older buyers are buying before they stop working.</p>

</div><div class="author">By S. Mitra Kalita   </div><div>553 words</div><div>21 January 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for existing homes perked up in December as buyers snapped up bargains and rushed to lock in historic low interest rates, according to data released Thursday by the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes rose 12.3% from November, hitting a seven-month high. That was hardly enough, though, to salvage an otherwise weak year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales volume in 2010, at 4.9 million, was the lowest since 1997, according to preliminary data from the trade group. Final year-end tallies will be released next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists were cautious in their assessment of the report, saying the housing market remains far from recovery. December's rebound set an annualized pace of 5.28 million existing homes sold -- far below the 2005 peak of nearly 7.1 million existing homes sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's still very weak historically," said David Berson, chief economist of the <span class="companylink">PMI Group</span>. "A 5.28 million pace is not strong. It shows the impact of only modest economic growth and only modest increases in households," Mr. Berson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of distressed homes, which include foreclosures and short sales, rose to a 36% market share in December from 33% in November. That spurred more discounting, with prices falling 1% in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 2010 as a whole, median prices rose 0.3%. But single-family homes in locations such as Phoenix, Atlanta and Miami experienced double-digit price declines over the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some house hunters say the bargains drove them to finally act. "We saw 2010 being a low point and an opportunity to make a very good purchase," said Joshua Dempsey, who bought a three-bedroom home in April with his wife in Napa Valley, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dempsey also works as the director of real estate at Calistoga Ranch, Calif., a resort with both a five-star hotel and vacation properties. The latter are half sold now, a sign of "renewed confidence in the marketplace and a willingness for buyers to move forward," Mr. Dempsey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising interest rates also are having an effect on the marketplace, said David Blitzer, the chairman and managing director of the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Index Committee. Average rates on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages have begun to inch upward from a 60-year bottom reached in October, though rates still remain very low. <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said Thursday that the average rate for a 30-year fixed loan was 4.74%, up from 4.71% last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of people who had gotten commitments, but hadn't locked in rates, looked at the numbers and decided they had to lock in the mortgage and close the purchase," said Mr. Blitzer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That also gave the market a little bit of pop," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In NAR's assessment, December's existing-home sales data portends well for 2011, and the all-important spring home-buying market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is getting much closer to an adequate, sustainable level," said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The recovery will likely continue as job growth gains momentum and rising rents encourage more renters into ownership, while exceptional affordability conditions remain," Mr. Yun said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 6-inch by 3-inch package was deemed suspicious because it was wrapped in bubble wrap and addressed to an officer of <span class="companylink">Bank Hapoalim</span>, near Rockefeller Center, but the name was misspelled and there was no return address, police said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Police on Wednesday arrested two more students of Gardena High School near Los Angeles, allegedly for trying to help a 17-year-old friend avoid punishment after he smuggled a semi-automatic pistol into a classroom that apparently discharged accidentally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two students were struck by the single bullet Tuesday, with the student who brought the gun running out of the classroom and, according to investigators, trying to escape by trading clothes with a male student and giving his backpack to a female student. It isn't clear whether prosecutors will charge the two students with concealing evidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The primary suspect could be charged with assault with a deadly weapon. All three students were being held at a juvenile detention center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as the sprawling Los Angeles Unified School District stepped up efforts to use metal detectors to find guns, administrators received a dramatic reminder of violence around school buildings.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction dropped in December to its lowest level in more than a year as the feeble housing sector ended 2010 on a weak note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private building of new homes dropped 4.3% in December from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 529,000 -- the lowest level of housing starts since October 2009, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction industry continued to stumble last year even as economic growth picked up and private-sector job creation returned. Housing starts ended the year 8.2% below December 2009, and there's little sign building will pick up early this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"From what we've heard from builders, they're not very hopeful for recovery in 2011," said Mark Vitner, a <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Securities</span> economist. "The first half of the year, it looks like housing's going to be dead in the water."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey of builder sentiment released Tuesday showed they were still pessimistic about the home-building landscape in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month's construction weakness was the result of a decline in single-family housing starts, which make up the vast bulk of new residential construction. New single-family home construction dipped 9% to 417,000. It was the lowest level of single-family home construction since May 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for single-family homes has been battered during the recession and subsequent recovery as home builders competed with an excess supply of previously owned homes -- fueled in part by a flood of foreclosures by banks -- and faced difficulties gaining credit for new projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New single-family home construction ended the year down 14.2% from December 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective buyers have been pinched by tighter lending standards and lingering worries over high unemployment. Hard times have forced some families to double up in housing, which has been a factor in curbing demand for new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing industry received a boost early last year from a first-time home-buyer tax credit that helped revive sales, but activity faltered once the credit expired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As fewer Americans opt for home ownership, demand for apartments has been strengthening. Construction of multifamily housing, which includes more than five units, was up 25.9% in December from the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly changes in multifamily housing tend to be volatile. Still, building for new multifamily housing was up 30.8% from the same time a year ago.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Barbara Kollmeyer and Ishaq Siddiqi   </div><div>726 words</div><div>20 January 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>23</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A steep share-price decline for <span class="companylink">ASML Holding</span> weighed on European stocks Wednesday, with further pressure coming from U.S. corporate earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stoxx Europe 600 index slid 1.4% to 282.72. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index shed 1.3% to 5976.70, France's CAC-40 index fell 0.9% to 3976.71 and Germany's DAX index slipped 0.8% to 7082.76.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A crop of disappointing U.S. bank earnings, especially one from <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, soured the mood on financial stocks, which have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the recent rally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 12.64 points, or 0.1%, at 11825.29. Strong earnings from <span class="companylink">International Business Machines</span> helped limit losses among blue-chip companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.5% to 2725.36 and the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index slid 1% to 1281.92.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. economic data was mixed. Housing starts fell 4.3% in December from a month earlier, while building permits, a gauge of future construction, surged 16.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruised optimism about economic growth drove demand for U.S. Treasurys. The 10-year note rose 10/32 in price to yield 3.333%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in Asia, stock markets ended higher, with many technology shares rising after upbeat results from Apple and IBM. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average closed up 0.4%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index added 1.1% and China's Shanghai Composite gained 1.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Europe, the technology sector came under pressure as ASML fell 6.8% in Amsterdam. Analysts said investors were disappointed by a lack of information about the outlook for orders, although the Dutch maker of lithography systems for the chip industry reported record fourth-quarter profit, sales and bookings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So that means they are not very sure about the future, and of course when people look at profits, they especially look at provisions for the next quarters, and ASML didn't give that," said Koen De Leus, strategist at KBC Securities Bolero in Brussels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Paris, <span class="companylink">STMicroelectronics</span> fell 3%, while Germany's Infineon Technologies lost 1.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. De Leus said markets are also coming off recent strong gains. The Stoxx Europe 50 index is up more than 5% this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's huge for the first month, and we've not even finished the first month," he said, adding that disappointment had set into markets after initial excitement over the outcome of a meeting of euro-zone finance ministers in Brussels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministers initially pledged to expand emergency-funding capabilities for needy member states, but indications are that Germany isn't willing to push hard on this matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Europe's sovereign-dent market, Portugal sold 750 million euros ($1 billion) of 12-month bills at an average yield of 4.03%, down from 5.28% in the previous auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In currency trading, the dollar rebounded from losses following the economic reports, but was still lower against the euro and yen. In afternoon trade, the euro rose to $1.3461 from $1.3385 late Tuesday. The dollar hit a two-week low against the Japanese before recovering to 82.04 yen from 82.63 yen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil for February delivery fell 52 cents, or 0.6%, to $90.86 a barrel on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>. Gold for January delivery on the Comex division of the Nymex rose $2.10, or 0.2%, to $1,370.20 per troy ounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In major market action:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pearson rose 4.5% in London as the media group raised its earnings guidance for 2010, saying it sees "healthy" sales growth and further margin improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Barclays</span> fell 3.8% as investors considered the significance of Goldman's disappointing results. Miners also took a battering. Antofagastasagged 3.6% and <span class="companylink">Xstrata</span> dropped 2.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Frankfurt, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Lufthansa</span> fell 3.6% amid labor unrest. The auto sector was also in the doldrums. <span class="companylink">BMW</span> fell 1.5% and Daimler dropped 2.4%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction dropped in December to its lowest level in more than a year as the feeble housing sector ended 2010 on a weak note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private building of new homes dropped 4.3% in December from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 529,000—the lowest level of housing starts since October 2009, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. The construction industry continued to stumble last year even as economic growth picked up and private-sector job creation returned. Housing starts ended the year 8.2% below December 2009 and there's little sign building will pick up early this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"From what we've heard from builders, they're not very hopeful for recovery in 2011," said Mark Vitner, a <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Securities</span> economist. "The first half of the year, it looks like housing's going to be dead in the water."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey of builder sentiment released Tuesday showed they were still pessimistic about the home-building landscape in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month's construction weakness was the result of a decline in single-family housing starts, which make up the vast bulk of new residential construction. New single-family home construction dipped 9% to 417,000. It was the lowest level of single-family home construction since May 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for single-family homes has been battered during the recession and subsequent recovery as builders competed with an excess supply of previously owned homes—fueled in part by a flood of foreclosures–and faced difficulties gaining credit for new projects. New single-family home construction ended the year down 14.2% from December 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective buyers have been pinched by tighter lending standards and lingering worries over high unemployment. Hard times have forced some families to double up in housing, which has been a factor in curbing demand for new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing industry received a boost early last year from a first-time homebuyer tax credit that helped revive sales, but activity faltered once the credit expired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As fewer Americans opt for home ownership, demand for apartments has been strengthening. Construction of multifamily housing, which includes more than five units, was up 25.9% in December from the prior month. Monthly changes in multifamily housing tend to be volatile. Still, building for new multifamily housing was up 30.8% from the same time a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a more upbeat note for housing, building permits for all types of residential housing were up 16.7% in December, though part of the increase could stem from a change in building codes in certain states that went into effect in January, the Commerce Department said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Busted condominium developments are coming back to life in Manhattan's Financial District, which saw its rebirth as a residential area stymied by the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recession hit just as about two dozen luxury developments were hitting the market or under way. Several boasted of high-end amenities like swimming pools or golf simulators, or sponsored marketing parties that featured entertainers like singer John Legend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many projects have sat half-empty or unfinished for long stretches. In recent weeks, a number of lenders and developers have taken steps to get them rolling again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the neighborhood known as "FiDi" emerges from the downturn, it's showing less swagger than what developers once envisioned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new owners of William Beaver House, for instance, are slashing condo prices. The creditors of the Setai Wall Street are selling their defaulted loan, a move expected to help closings resume there. The lenders to 25 Broad Street are foreclosing on the property, paving the way for converting it to rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People in the Financial District got a little over-ambitious, both in terms of prices and concepts," says Frederick Peters, president of Warburg Realty. He said some developers became so obsessed with luxury amenities, they lost site of such basics as floor plans. "You can't sell amenities and not the unit," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Financial District's residential community has been growing since the mid-1990s when the city began offering tax incentives to developers who converted obsolete office property into apartment buildings. The neighborhood's population has doubled since 2001 to 55,000, according to a 2010 survey that the Alliance for Downtown New York did of Manhattan south of Chambers Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detractors complain FiDi still lacks services like large grocery stores, and that condos converted from office buildings often have small kitchens, obstructed views and unorthodox layouts. Fans point to new schools, the expansion of the Fulton Street subway station and a growing variety of restaurants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's very popular with young professionals or investors who have no trouble finding people to rent their apartments," says Ariel Cohen, a Prudential Douglas Elliman broker who is active in the Financial District</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area's average household income was $188,000 in 2009, the survey found (though that slipped from $242,000 in 2007). Luxury retailers like Hermes and boutique hotels like Hyatt's Andaz have rushed in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's tax incentives have expired but developers have continued to be lured by the high income of workers in the area as well as its stately architecture and cobblestone streets. The neighborhood added 6,000 residential units since 2007, the Downtown Alliance said. The new supply became a glut, leaving a number of ambitious projects in limbo or dead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one of the most ambitious, developer Kent Swig teamed up with Robert De Niro with plans for a 62-story condo and hotel, plus a Nobu restaurant and 13,000 square feet of retail space. The developer defaulted, and the site, at 45 Broad St., is currently an empty lot. The estate of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings</span> is in the process of foreclosing on the property, say people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other troubled developments, however, are faring better. Lehman is foreclosing on another Swig building at 25 Broad St., a 1902 office building that was converted to rentals and then, by Mr. Swig to condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman is expected to complete the foreclosure process as early as the spring and hopes to rent out units this year. New construction on the building facade, heating and air-condition system have restarted, say people familiar with the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Swig declined to comment on his buildings, saying, "FiDi is a prime destination for both New Yorkers and world visitors alike."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CIM Group, a Los Angeles-based real-estate investor, last month bought the debt and then took control of 209 unsold condo units at William Beaver House. Public documents show that the new owners have cut asking prices -- some by more than 20% -- while aiming to rent most of the unsold apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Setai Wall Street, Anglo Irish Bank Corp. is looking for a buyer for a $147 million construction loan that's in default. While sales of about 40% of the building's units have closed, the New York attorney general halted additional closings until it gets more information about the project's financing. Brokers hope that the imminent loan's sale will enable closings to resume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two buildings developed by Africa Israel USA are also in better shape after a tough stretch. At 20 Pine St., the former <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> building, more than 90% of the 406 condos are either closed or in contract, says Lori Ordover, a consultant to the developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A majority of those sales came after the developer took control of the project from its partner Shaya Boymelgreen and cut prices substantially: units sold for an average of $1,100 to $1,200 a square foot during the boom, while some have gone for $700 to $800 a square foot more recently. Fourteen of the buyers haven't been able to close. "We're trying to resolve legal issues so they are available for resale," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Africa Israel turned away numerous hedge-fund offers for bulk sales at $500 a square foot during the worst of the market, Ms. Ordover said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Africa Israel's other project, the District on Fulton Street, recently sold the last of its 163 condo units, says Ms. Ordover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another sign of the times, Africa Israel has brought in Warburg as the agent of 20 Pine to replace Michael Shvo, a residential broker closely associated with the condo boom and celebrity-collaborations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shvo said the relationship with the 20 Pine developers ended on a previously agreed-upon date, and that he sold condos there at record prices.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco Mansion</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lists for $32 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ron Zeff, founder of real-estate investment company Carmel Partners, listed his San Francisco home for $32 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 16,000-square-foot neoclassical revival-style home was built in 1910 and restored and redesigned in 2002. The home has seven bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, two kitchens and an elevator. There's an indoor basketball court, a wine cellar and a large terrace on the top level that has views of the San Francisco Bay and Golden Gate Bridge. There's also a dining room with two 19th-century crystal chandeliers and a master suite that has separate his and hers bathrooms and dressing rooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zeff bought the home through the Clarmont Street Trust in 1998, according to public records. Neal Ward and Gael Bruno of McGuire Real Estate have the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Padres' Moorad Officially Lists</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arizona Home for $17.9 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff Moorad, vice chairman and chief executive of baseball's San Diego Padres, and his wife, Jan, have officially listed their eight-bedroom, nine-bathroom vacation home in Paradise Valley, Ariz., for $17.9 million. The home had been quietly marketed for $28 million in fall 2009, say local brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 55-year-old former sports agent bought the property in 2005 for $9.43 million and spent several million dollars expanding and renovating it. There's a 10,000-square-foot main house, a 2,500-square-foot guest house, a pool and basketball and tennis courts. "The goal was to create something unique that spoke to Arizona as well as our interest to create a Mediterranean-style home that fit in Paradise Valley," says Mr. Moorad, who lives in La Jolla, Calif. Walter Danley of Walt Danley Group has the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former John Hancock CEO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lists Home for $21 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Benson, the former chief executive of John Hancock Life Insurance, and his wife, Marlene, have listed their Boston-area home for $21 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bensons spent four years building the 21,000-square-foot, Georgian Colonial-style home. The house, in Weston, Mass., has six bedrooms, 11 bathrooms. There is a 2,300-bottle wine cellar, a tasting room, a spa and a home theater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bensons bought the nearly four-acre property in 1997 from Queen Elizabeth II, who technically owned it, though it was occupied by Boston's Canadian consul general. Mr. Benson says he's selling because his children are out of high school and he and his wife plan to move into Boston. Beth Dickerson of Gibson Sotheby's International Realty in Boston has the listing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ORLANDO, Fla.—Housing economists expect the troubled residential market to begin picking up in 2011, with low mortgage rates and bargain home prices boosting sales in the spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economists, who delivered their forecasts on a panel at the National Association of Home Builders' annual meeting here, noted the market remains extremely weak, prices are still falling, and they don't expect any recovery to be robust. But they said a number of recent economic indicators have convinced them that housing sales, which have stalled lately, could soon begin to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy is creating new jobs, holiday sales came in better than expected, and sales of cars and furniture have improved, noted David Crowe, chief economist for the NAHB. Those trends, he said, are "signifying growing consumer confidence."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of abysmal construction and sales activity, Mr. Crowe expects builders to start construction on 575,000 single-family homes this year, up 21% from last year. That would still be far below the 2005 peak of 1.7 million housing starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAHB also expects new home sales to hit 405,000, up 26% from 2010, as buyers who delayed purchases ink deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the outlook for 2010 at last year's conference proved much too optimistic. At that time, the NAHB economist saw 610,000 single-family starts for 2010. The actual count, which isn't yet final, is expected to come in at 475,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Crowe says this year will be better as more jobs are filled and more buyers leave the sidelines. "Consumers are finally willing to go forward," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outlook for home prices is less upbeat. <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> Chief Economist Frank Nothaft expects home prices to bottom in the first half of this year, and mortgage rates to edge up slightly, ending 2011 closer to 5.25%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Berson, chief economist of mortgage insurer <span class="companylink">PMI Group</span>, believes prices will weaken further in the next few months, but end the year flat. Next year, he said in an interview, pricing will increase slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It won't be until 2013 that there will be long-term sustainable gains at the historical average rate of 3.5%-4%, he said. Mr. Berson missed the panel as a result of weather-related travel problems, but provided his outlook in a phone interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the 50,000 attendees at this year's builders conference are also cautiously optimistic, hoping that prices have come down far enough to pull buyers off the fence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People now have waited long enough and are tired of waiting," said Don Eyler, owner of E+R Construction in Indiana. "Right now, you can build a house for the same price as an existing one in some places."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other builders questioned whether they would be in a position to benefit when any upturn occurs. "I've been a builder for 44 years," said Richard Jenkins, owner of R.J. Builders in Terre Haute, Ind. "Indiana has little dips and little valleys, but I've never seen anything like this before. In 1982, you could borrow money. You just had to pay the price for it. Now, you can't."</p>
