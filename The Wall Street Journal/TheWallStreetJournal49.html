<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factory activity in the U.S. increased in July amid a jump in new orders and production, a private survey found. Inflation pressures moderated but remained high, while hiring slowed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management's July manufacturing index rose to 62 points from 61.1 in June. Economists had expected a reading of 61.6, according to a survey by and CNBC. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. Of 20 industries surveyed, 18 reported growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The manufacturing sector continues to grow at a rapid rate," said Norbert J. Ore, chairman of the institute's survey committee. "The growth of new orders and production accelerated during the month, adding strength to the index."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute noted that with July's report, overall readings in the survey have been above 60 for nine months, the longest stretch since the period between July 1972 and June 1973. If the July reading of 62 were to be maintained for an extended period, it would be consistent with a 7% annualized increase in the U.S.'s gross domestic product, or the total value of goods and services produced there, the institute said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the survey, the new-orders index rose to 64.7 from 60 in June, while the production index climbed to 66.1 from 63.2. Meanwhile, the employment reading fell to 57.3 from 59.7. Inventories contracted to 49.9 from 51.1, and order backlogs fell to 58 from 58.5.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ore said he was reluctant to say the decline in the rate of employment growth amid increased production was due to productivity. "Sixteen out of 20 industries had higher new orders in July, and the remainder were just unchanged," he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley, wrote to clients that the downturn in the employment index "was not nearly large enough" to alter forecasts for Friday's coming report on July nonfarm payrolls. On average, economists predict the U.S. economy added 215,000 new jobs in July, according to Dow Jones Newswires.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the 29th consecutive month, manufacturers faced higher prices, though price growth was slower in July. The prices index registered a reading of 77, from 81 in June. The institute noted that "energy prices remain a major concern for purchasers, as prices are at or near record highs." Crude-oil futures have marched higher in recent days -- nudging close to $44 a barrel yesterday morning -- amid supply jitters and new terrorism warnings in the U.S.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regional factory surveys had hinted at strength in the sector in recent weeks. On Friday, the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago's index of area-business activity rose to 64.7 in July on a seasonally adjusted basis from 56.4 in June. The gauge was 68 in May. District surveys conducted by the New York and Philadelphia branches of the U.S. Federal Reserve also improved over June's readings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Commerce Department said total construction spending in June fell 0.3%, the first decline since January, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $985.16 billion. That followed a revised 0.1% gain in construction spending in May, which had been estimated as a 0.3% rise. On an annual basis, total construction spending was 8.6% higher. Forecasters had expected construction spending to be unchanged. Spending on public construction climbed by 0.2% in June after posting a 0.3% decrease in May.  </p>

If the July reading of 62 were to be maintained for an extended period, it would be consistent with a 7% annualized increase in the U.S.'s gross domestic product, or the total value of goods and services produced there, the institute said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the survey, the new-orders index rose to 64.7 from 60 in June, while the production index climbed to 66.1 from 63.2. Meanwhile, the employment reading fell to 57.3 from 59.7. Inventories contracted to 49.9 from 51.1, and order backlogs fell to 58 from 58.5.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley, wrote to clients that the downturn in the employment index "was not nearly large enough" to alter forecasts for Friday's coming report on July nonfarm payrolls. On average, economists predict the U.S. economy added 215,000 new jobs in July, according to Dow Jones Newswires.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the 29th consecutive month, manufacturers faced higher prices, though price growth was slower in July. The institute noted that "energy prices remain a major concern for purchasers, as prices are at or near record highs."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude-oil futures have marched higher in recent days -- nudging close to $44 (36.61 euros) a barrel yesterday morning -- amid supply jitters and new terrorism warnings in the U.S.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the U.S. Commerce Department said total construction spending in June fell 0.3%, the first decline since January, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $985.16 billion. That followed a revised 0.1% gain in construction spending in May, which had been estimated as a 0.3% rise. On an annual basis, total construction spending was 8.6% higher.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Consumer confidence in the U.S. rose for the fourth straight month in July to reach a two-year high, thanks to steady improvements in the job market, the Conference Board said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The private research group said its index of consumer confidence in July moved to a better-than-expected 106.1, after having risen to a revised 102.8 a month earlier. The July reading was the best since June 2002. The median expectation of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires was for a reading of 102.2 for the month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center, said the gains were fueled by a better outlook for jobs, "and unless the job market sours, consumer confidence should continue to post solid numbers."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey is based on a sample of 5,000 U.S. households.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news cheered U.S. financial markets, lifting stocks and bringing the dollar to a six-week high against the yen, a three-week high against sterling, and its highest level of July versus the euro.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders said the consumer-confidence report is an encouraging sign for the U.S. economy, which lately has become a key focus for currency markets. A recent spate of weakening economic data, including job creation and retail sales, has suggested the U.S. economy might have cooled somewhat during June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The confidence indicator will be taken by many as a sign that the consumer will continue to provide positive impulses, helping to confirm the prediction last week by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that recent sluggishness in the economy was due to temporary factors and will be short-lived.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A high number was expected, and it came in even higher," said Patrick Brodie, chief dealer at Sumitomo Mitsui in New York. "This should continue the bid tone the dollar has had over the past week."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the U.S. Commerce Department said new home sales edged down 0.8% in June after soaring at a record pace in May.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The June decline pushed sales of new single-family homes down to an annual rate of 1.33 million units, still the second-highest level on record, following the sales pace of 1.34 million in May.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline was smaller than the one analysts had been predicting and indicated that the housing sector, one of the star performers of this recovery, still has a tremendous amount of momentum even though mortgage rates are now about one percentage point higher than they were a year ago.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Consumer confidence in the U.S. rose for the fourth straight month in July to reach a two-year high, thanks to a stronger job market, the Conference Board said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The private research group's index of consumer confidence in July moved to a better-than-expected 106.1, after having risen to a revised 102.8 a month earlier.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's another indication that the economy is coming out of the soft patch that we were in this summer," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo &amp;Co. in Minneapolis.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales in the U.S. of previously occupied homes rose 2.1% in June from May to an annual rate of 6.95 million, setting another record, the National Association of Realtors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association cited lean supply and strong demand.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home construction in the U.S. took its biggest tumble in more than a year during June, as mortgage rates crept upward and the job market weakened. Building permits, which provide a glimpse of future demand, also fell.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Commerce Department reported that housing starts last month decreased 8.5% to a seasonally adjusted 1.802 million annual rate, the sharpest drop since a decline of 10.7% in February 2003. Starts rose 0.4% in May to a 1.970 million rate. That marked an upward revision from a previously reported 0.7% decline to 1.967 million. Mortgage rates had climbed above 6% in the spring.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had projected June housing starts would increase by 1.2% to a 1.990 million annual rate. But the weaker-than-expected report was consistent with other recent U.S. economic data -- including tepid retail sales and a lackluster jobs report -- that suggested the economy hit a rough patch last month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts said that June's decline may be simply a blip in the data, and that housing starts remain historically high. Peter E. Kretzmer, an economist at Bank of America Corp. in New York, predicted that housing starts will rebound in July but added: "Homebuilders are now behaving more cautiously than in recent years, as they brace for the effects of higher interest rates on housing activity."  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR NEARLY two decades, Joseph Russ has bought houses, rented them out, and then sold them a few years later. With prices now rising at an annual clip of 30% in his hometown of Las Vegas, he's taking a different tack: He's flipping them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Russ recently closed on a $269,000 home, and is planning to resell, next month. The 62-year-old retired city planner says a prospective buyer has offered him $349,000, nearly a 30% profit on his investment. But when Mr. Russ also tried to buy one of the thousands of new homes popping up in Las Vegas, home builders -- on the lookout for speculators like him who try to make a fast profit -- slammed the door on him. "One builder had a sign on the door saying `we're no longer taking investors,' " he gripes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He isn't the only quick-turn investor to face frustration. Builders in parts of California, Arizona, Virginia and other heated markets are adopting similar antispeculation tactics. Related Group of Florida, a closely held Miami developer, requires buyers to disclose whether they have signed contracts to buy homes in other developments that Related is building -- if so, they may be barred from buying at Related properties. KB Home, a big builder based in Los Angeles, demands that buyers promise to occupy the purchased home for one year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home builders' crackdown is a big turnaround from the last housing boom in the late 1980s, when they didn't discourage such practices. Fueled by easy access to capital, home builders went on a developing binge and overestimated demand in part because of buying by speculators. Many builders fell into financial trouble and some were forced out of business. "When you're selling a lot of homes to investors, it gives you a false view of the market," says JoAnne Anderson, vice president of sales and marketing for the northern California division of Shea Homes, a closely held builder in Walnut, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's little doubt that speculative activity is "setting us up for a price correction," in some markets, says John Burns, a real estate consultant in Irvine, Calif. In Orange County, Calif., nearly 4% of homes sold in April had been purchased only in the previous six months. A year earlier, such homes accounted for only 2% of the total sold. In April, the homes bought and sold within six months increased by 54% in Chicago, 66% in Harrisburg, Pa., and 83% in Forth Worth, Texas, compared to the six months prior to April, according to Dataquick Information Services, a real estate data firm in San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increases aren't yet cause for alarm, but they distort the market, economists say. One concern is that when prices cool, investors are prone to dump homes quickly, pushing prices down faster. Buyers who live in their homes are more likely to stay put, which helps keep prices firm, says Raphael Bostic, director of the Casden Real Estate Economics Forecast at the University of Southern California's Lusk Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders say they are clamping down on speculators to protect customers as well as their own long-term business fortunes. Speculators can drive down the quality of life in a community because they don't invest as much money in the house or on landscaping as live-in owners. Investors also leave a trail of "For Sale" or "For Rent" signs that can turn off home buyers who think the neighborhood looks like a transient community, says Jeff Mezger, chief operating officer of KB Home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speculators are more likely than other buyers to walk away before completing a purchase if the market softens, home builders say. Most large builders start construction on homes after receiving an order, but buyers in California and some other places have a legal right to cancel until the house is finished. Construction of homes can take as long as nine months and if prices haven't appreciated significantly, speculators can simply back out of the deal, leaving the builder with costly excess inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in states like Florida, where buyers are bound by purchase contracts, builders are clamping down. Home prices in the state jumped by 20% in May from a year earlier and tales of speculative activity abound. Related is concerned that such spectacular gains are pushing ordinary people -- who don't understand the risks -- into real-estate speculation. Earlier this year, the company started requiring disclosure of a buyer's investments in other housing developments. Related's broker, Related Cervera Realty Services, says it reviews such buyers' financial situations on a case-by-case basis before deciding whether to proceed with a sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, KB Home rolled out a companywide policy that requires would-be home buyers to sign an affidavit stating they will live in the home for at least a year. Previously, KB Home only required the affidavits in hot markets like Las Vegas. In the past year, Standard Pacific Corp., Irvine, Calif., instituted a similar policy in select markets. Shea Homes has over the past year inserted a provision in its contracts to deter flipping. The clause gives the company the preemptive right to buy back a home at the original price within a year of purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KB Home, Standard Pacific and Shea all say they allow for exceptions in hardship cases of divorce, job loss or medical emergencies. Except for the most unscrupulous investors, most people don't want to risk a lawsuit, they say. Real estate attorneys say the provisions appear to be legal, but they aren't aware of any precedent-setting court cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's evidence that the builders' clampdown is keeping a lid on flipping. Gloria Murray cleared $110,000 in profit after she flipped a condominium in Reston, Va., last month. But when she went to buy another condo in a different project nearby, she backed away because the developer required buyers to live in the unit for at least one year. "What if the market starts to soften and I want to sell the minute it's built?" Ms. Murray asks.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. manufacturing sector continued to show strong growth last month, even though the pace of growth slipped.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, an association of supply managers that polls purchasing agents at more than 400 industrial companies each month, said its index of manufacturing activity registered 61.1 in June, down from 62.8 in May and 62.4 in April. Any reading above 50 indicates that the manufacturing sector is expanding, and this month's reading marks the eighth consecutive month the ISM's index has been above 60.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're still seeing a very significant rate of growth within the manufacturing sector, especially considering the last time we've been above 60 for this amount of time was in the early 1980s," said Norbert J. Ore, who heads the committee that conducts the ISM survey. And while the pace was somewhat slower, he still characterized growth as "aggressive."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department said U.S. construction spending climbed to a record, pushed by strong gains in home construction. Total construction spending rose 0.3% in May to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of $988.5 billion (810.9 billion euros). The May increase followed a revised 1.2% gain in construction spending in April, which had previously been estimated as a 1.3% rise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report, the Labor Department said new filings for unemployment insurance rose by a seasonally adjusted 1,000 to 351,000 for the week ended June 26. Economists had expected claims to fall.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM reported that manufacturing expanded in 17 of the 20 industries they survey; the tobacco industry was unchanged and two other industries, food and the glass-stone-aggregate sectors, saw declines. Still, a growing number of manufacturers expressed concerns over the rising cost of natural gas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists say that the index's slowdown of growth is a positive sign. "The index is saying that instead of really strong growth, we are moving towards more sustainable solid growth and that's good, because it means the pressure on inflation won't be nearly as great," says Joel Naroff, an independent economist in Holland, Pa.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. manufacturers saw activity grow at a slightly less robust rate in June, as prices moderated a bit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, a private research group, said its index of manufacturing activity ebbed to 61.1 in June, from 62.8 in May and 62.4 in April. Readings above 50 indicate expansion and describe the breadth of that change, although not the level of increase seen by individual survey respondents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reading for June met forecasters' expectations. The median finding of analysts surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and CNBC was for a reading of 61.5. Some forecasters had noted that after comparatively weak manufacturing data in the Chicago Purchasing Managers data Wednesday, there had been an increased chance of weakness in the June ISM data Thursday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The manufacturing sector grew at a slightly slower, but still aggressive, rate in June," said Norbert Ore, who directs the survey for the ISM. "June represents a strong finish to the first half of the year, and the current picture is very encouraging for the third quarter, as new orders and production are still growing significantly," he added.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">June's reading marked the 13th straight month of growth for the sector. If the June level were maintained for an extended period of time, it would be consistent with a 6.7% annualized increase in U.S. gross domestic product, the ISM said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the U.S. Commerce Department said U.S. construction spending climbed to a new high in May, pushed higher by strong gains in home construction. Total construction spending rose 0.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $988.53 billion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The May increase followed a revised 1.2% gain in construction spending in April, which previously had been estimated as a 1.3% rise. The May construction-spending increase, however, was less than Wall Street analysts were expecting; they had predicted a 0.6% rise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the U.S. Labor Department reported new filings for unemployment insurance rose by a seasonally adjusted 1,000 to 351,000 for the week ended June 26. Economists had expected claims to fall. Nevertheless, they said the latest figures are consistent with an improving labor market and show that the pace of layoffs has moderated when compared with a year earlier.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new, single-family homes in the U.S. soared to a record annual rate in May, defying forecasts that rising mortgage rates would slow the housing market. Separately, the U.S. manufacturing sector hit a speed bump as durable-goods orders slipped, and jobless claims ticked up slightly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists pointed to rising employment, growing personal income and the fact that interest rates remain relatively low as strong contributing factors to the new-home-sales data, an up-to-date snapshot of housing activity that counts deals that have gone to contract. Analysts were divided, however, on why prices showed an unusual decline, especially in light of recent widespread fears of escalating sticker prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders may be cutting prices to remain competitive in the face of higher interest rates, said Drew Matus, an economist at Lehman Brothers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, pointed to strong sales in the South, a region typically characterized by lower average prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new, single-family homes surged 14.8% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.369 million units, up from a revised rate of 1.192 million units in April, the U.S. Commerce Department said. Sales were strongest in the South and the Northeast. Average house prices nationwide declined to $256,700 (212,340 euros) in May from $262,500 in April.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its meeting Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee is widely expected to raise its short-term interest-rate targets from a 46-year low of 1%, which would tend to put upward pressure on mortgage rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, orders for durable goods fell by 1.6% to $189.1 billion last month, after a drop of 2.6% in April -- revised from 2.9% -- and a gain of 5.9% in March, according to the Commerce Department. The last back-to-back declines in the indicator, which measures purchases of goods generally expected to last more than three years, were in November and December 2002, according to Insight Economics, an independent economic-research firm in Danville, California.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nondefense-capital goods excluding aircraft, viewed as an important indicator of business spending, declined 1.3% in May, compared with a 2.0% drop in April, revised from 2.4%.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new, single-family homes soared in May, despite higher mortgage rates that are expected to slow the housing market eventually. Separately, the manufacturing sector hit a speed bump as durable-goods orders slipped, and jobless claims ticked up slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists pointed to rising employment, increasing personal income and continued low interest rates as strong contributing factors to the new-home sales data, as well as a rush by fence-sitters to buy before mortgage rates rose more. Analysts were divided, however, on why average new-home sale prices showed an unusual decline, especially in light of recent widespread fears of escalating sticker prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders may be cutting prices to remain competitive in the face of higher interest rates, said Drew Matus, an economist at Lehman Brothers. "A one percentage point increase in mortgage rates leads to about a 10% drop in home affordability," Mr. Matus said. "That 10% has got to come from somewhere."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, pointed to strong sales in the South, a region typically characterized by lower average prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new, single-family homes surged 14.8% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,369,000 units, up from a revised rate of 1,192,000 units in April, the Commerce Department said. Sales were strongest in the South and the Northeast. Average house prices nationwide declined to $256,700 in May from $262,500 in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday's data may stoke fears that the housing market is at its peak, as consumers rush to buy homes before interest rates rise further. At its meeting Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee is widely expected to raise its short-term interest-rate target from a 46-year low of 1%, which would tend to put upward pressure on mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, orders for durable goods fell 1.6% to $189.1 billion last month, after a decline of 2.6% in April -- revised from 2.9% -- and a gain of 5.9% in March, according to the Commerce Department.

Despite declines in durable-goods sales across sectors, economists treated the data warily, pointing to the historical volatility of this monthly indicator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The gains in February and March were so large that if you go back to the beginning of the year, we're still growing at a pretty strong pace," says Steven Stanley, an economist at RBS Greenwich Capital, in Greenwich, Conn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said new claims for unemployment insurance rose 13,000 to 349,000 in the latest week. The weekly data may have been distorted by the Reagan funeral, which closed state unemployment-insurance offices the previous week, depressing claims.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- The 30-year fixed home mortgage rate in the week ended yesterday fell to 6.25% from 6.32% a week earlier, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. durable-goods orders took a surprising drop in May, but analysts consider the broad-based decrease an aberration. Meanwhile, U.S. home sales surged amid fears of rising mortgage rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Durable-goods orders decreased 1.6% to $189.1 billion last month, after falling a revised 2.6% in April -- the first set of back-to-back declines since late 2002, the U.S. Commerce Department said. The April decline was previously reported as a 3.2% drop.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street had expected far better data for the latest month. A Dow Jones Newswires-CNBC survey of 20 economists had forecast a 1.2% increase in orders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The decline was a bit of a surprise, given the fact both consumers and businesses are spending money," said Wells Fargo chief economist Sung Won Sohn. "However, I think the decline is temporary. Businesses are really gearing up to increase their expenditures on everything from computers to pickup trucks. Consumers are continuing to spend money, which should boost everything from consumer electronics to autos."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimates on durable goods are volatile and subject to sharp revision. Durable-goods orders during March climbed 5.9%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another Commerce Department report showed single-family home sales rose 14.8%, surging to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.369 million. It was the sharpest increase since a 16.4% jump in April 1993, and carried sales to a new record level.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">April home sales were revised sharply upward, to reflect a 7.9% decrease to 1.192 million, from an earlier estimated 11.9% plunge in demand to 1.093 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street expected much weaker sales numbers for May. A Dow Jones Newswires-CNBC survey of 20 economists had predicted sales would rise 3% to a 1.126 million annual rate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lending rates remain relatively low, but have been rising from record levels. Analysts say "fence sitters" -- buyers entering the market on the belief rates have bottomed amid the rising economy -- are generating demand even as higher financing costs scare off some people.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Industrial production rose sharply last month, adding to optimism that the overall economy will continue to expand despite a cooling of the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1.1% increase in industrial production was the best one-month showing since August 1998, the Federal Reserve reported yesterday. In April, industrial activity rose 0.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing output, the largest part of industrial production, rose by 0.9% in May, up from a 0.7% increase the month before. Some of the production growth was due to unseasonably warm weather, which contributed to a 3.3% increase in output at natural-gas and electric utilities. Utilities output advanced 1.5% in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry used 77.8% of capacity during May, the highest level since May 2001 and up from April's revised 77.1%, initially reported at 76.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today's news is even better than it looks on the surface as the gains were widespread, with production increasing in 17 of 19 industries," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. High-tech and motor-vehicle industries were the only laggards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the housing front, rising mortgage rates slowed home building, but not by much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported that the number of new residential units under construction fell by a modest 0.7% in May from April, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.97 million. This follows a revised decline of 1% in April to a 1.98 million rate. April was initially reported as falling 2.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, an indicator of future new-home construction, unexpectedly rose by 3.5% in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.1 million units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is expected to slow further later this year after several years of record performance now that mortgage interest rates have moved off 40-year lows. Rates, while still low by historical standards, rose last week to 6.3% for 30-year loans, according to Freddie Mac, the mortgage giant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These and other recent reports underscore Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's view that the U.S. economy will see accelerating job growth and modest inflation. In testimony before Congress Tuesday, he suggested that the Fed is holding to its plan to boost interest rates at a "measured" pace. The Fed is widely expected to raise rates by 0.25 percentage point from its 46 year-low of 1% at a meeting on June 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Fed's 12 regional banks reported that U.S. economic activity continued to expand in April and May across the nation. Most regions reported faster manufacturing growth, with some describing it as "broad based." Residential real-estate markets remained strong in most districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest Beige Book, a survey of anecdotal reports from district banks, said that Chicago and Cleveland reported "robust demand for steel," with orders at Chicago producers booked for the "foreseeable future." Several other districts complained of "intensifying cost pressures" because of rising input costs, especially for steel, petrochemicals and wood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With regard to housing, single-family housing permits were up in districts represented by Fed banks in St. Louis, Minneapolis and New York. The Dallas district reported a large increase in home construction, leading to a rise in inventories. In Chicago, Dallas and Richmond, Virginia, "fence-sitters" were jumping into the housing market in anticipation of a rise in mortgage rates, the Fed report said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Robust industrial production last month fueled continued optimism about U.S. economic growth, even though the housing market cooled down slightly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production advanced 1.1% in May, showing that manufacturers are on a firm recovery path, the Federal Reserve reported yesterday. The gain, the best one-month showing since August 1998, compares with a strong unrevised 0.8% rise in April.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing production, the largest part of industrial activity, rose by 0.9% in May, up from a 0.7% increase the month before.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other largely positive economic news, rising mortgage rates slowed home building, but the level of activity remained brisk.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the May report showed building permits, an indicator of future new-home construction, unexpectedly rose by 3.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.1 million units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is expected to slow down from its current hot pace later this year after several years of record performance now that mortgage interest rates have risen from 40-year lows.

</div><div class="author">By Jim Carlton </div><div>3177 words</div><div>14 June 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>R8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NATIONWIDE boom in housing over the past few years has fueled a run-up in prices that can't last. Or can it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It depends on whom you ask.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pessimists argue, essentially, that the lowest interest rates in almost a half-century have ignited an unsustainable level of sales activity that will subside as rates creep inexorably up again, as they started doing the past few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the optimists say so many baby boomers have hit their full earnings stride that demand for homes is going to remain strong for the foreseeable future, with run-ups continuing in pricey locales like San Francisco where severe housing shortages persist. The San Francisco Bay area is one of the most expensive markets in the country, in large part because there is little available land to build on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To hear both sides of the argument in more detail, we invited a noted housing bear and housing bull to participate in a debate on the health of the U.S. housing market. The bear, John Talbott, 49 years old, is a former investment banker at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New York and author of "The Coming Crash of the Housing Market: 10 Things You Can Do Now." The bull, David Lereah, 50, is chief economist of the National Association of Realtors, the industry trade group based in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are excerpts from their exchange:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Do you think housing prices will continue to rise nationwide, and why or why not?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. TALBOTT: Many so-called housing experts believe that because the housing market is so big, it must act like a true economic market. They therefore conclude, wrongly, that the high prices we see for homes today are market-determined and, as such, are very good indicators of their true worth. If true, this would make them very unlikely to ever crash, as irrational bubbles rarely happen in efficiently priced markets. Thus they spend much of their time analyzing supply and demand for housing as if it were a perfect market, not subject to possible manipulation, corruption and collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But housing, and specifically home mortgages, do not act at all like perfect markets, and so the public should not gain any comfort that these prices being paid for homes today are sustainable. First, home buyers are not that sensitive to high prices because they are financing most of the purchase price. Lenders don't care about the price paid or the amount of leverage on the home because they sell most of their mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac aren't concerned that much with credit quality because they have an implied guarantee from you, the American taxpayer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, we find ourselves in a period of very loose mortgage credit, with home purchases being completed at very high prices and with very aggressive borrowing terms, and interest rates beginning to rise from a 40-year low. How long can prices continue to rise? According to the National Association of Realtors, prices have already peaked and have begun to fall from their peaks in much of the country. Nationally, NAR reports that prices are off some 4% [seasonally adjusted] since July of 2003, and the Southern states are off approximately 10%. A portion of this decline may be due to seasonal factors, but realize that this decline is beginning after housing prices have increased some 35 years in a row. And this is for data reported as of March of this year, and so does not include any effect of the recent rise in interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where are prices headed from here? Further down. The best case: Housing prices nationally will drop approximately 10% to 15% from their peaks. Worst case: They will fall between 15% and 25%. Changes of this magnitude are large enough to wipe out many people's entire equity in their homes. Under this scenario, major players in the mortgage business -- such as the primary mortgage bankers, providers [of private mortgage insurance], second-mortgage issuers and even Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- will run into financial trouble due to credit problems on their loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. LEREAH: Yes, housing prices are expected to continue to rise nationwide. Why? Because housing demand will continue to exceed housing supply, exerting upward pressure on prices. The real problem in the nation's housing sector is supply, not demand. The inventory of homes, as measured by [the amount of time a house is on the market], has hovered in the 4.3- to 4.8-month range for the past year, tight by any historical standard. In fact, in the fourth quarter of last year there were 19 major metropolitan areas in which the months' supply was less than four [months]. It is not a coincidence that most of these metro [areas] also experienced double-digit price appreciation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking forward, I expect a growing economy [with job gains to] exert upward pressure on mortgage rates. Modestly higher mortgage rates are expected to slow the pace of home sales from last year's record pace. . . . The concern some housing analysts have that house-price growth in some areas of the nation has risen considerably faster than income growth is justified, but exaggerated. It is true that if demand falls off sharply in these areas, there could be some price softening -- maybe even a correction in some cases. However, large price corrections are unlikely. Sharp price declines are usually driven by a substantial loss of jobs in a local area. Thus, it is very unlikely that prices would drop on a national scale. Price corrections are a local phenomenon, not national.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: How much longer will the U.S. remain in this low-interest-rate environment? And how much of a spike in rates would it take to slow down housing sales?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. TALBOTT: While no one can predict interest rates accurately, it is true that measured by historical norms interest rates are at relatively low levels. Do they have to rise? Not necessarily. The world economy could stumble if China continues to have problems with managing its growth, or oil prices remain high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But home buyers, especially those utilizing adjustable-rate mortgages to finance their purchase, should do the appropriate planning to allow if, indeed, rates do continue to rise in the future. The use of ARMs is increasing and now accounts for 31% of all mortgages [being originated.] Short-term interest rates used to reprice adjustable-rate mortgages are much more volatile and much more subject to increasing as the [Federal Reserve] raises rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners who have fixed their interest-rate exposure by borrowing long term are not completely out of the woods. Home prices could begin to decline as rates increase, and homeowners who thought they had removed their exposure to interest rates may be forced to sell into a down market due to unforeseen circumstances -- a divorce, job loss or medical emergency in the family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the 10-year Treasury rate gets to 6%, watch out! And this is still quite low by historical standards. To get there, we don't have to have a booming recovery and rising demand for investment funds. With annual government deficits of more than $500 billion and no effective plan to provide for the retirement of the baby boom [generation], it would be rational for bond investors to demand higher returns if they expect inflation to creep back into the picture as the government faces greater pressure to inflate its currency rather than borrow in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. LEREAH: As the U.S. economy continues to gain momentum, the Federal Reserve is expected to be less accommodative, creating an environment for interest rates to rise a bit. According to the Labor Department, the economy added 308,000 jobs in March, which bodes well for future economic activity. I now expect 30-year mortgage rates to rise to 6.4% by the fourth quarter of this year, damping the demand for home buying. Home sales will slow to a 5.8 million annualized pace in the fourth quarter, from the record 6.1 million-unit pace set in 2003. However, for the year, existing home sales are expected to register 5.9 million, which would be the second-highest number of sales on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates would have to spike a great deal higher for there to be a meaningful slowing of home sales. My best guess is that the 30-year mortgage rate would have to climb above 7% for sales to fall a bit more. But remember, the reason rates would be climbing is that the economy is growing and adding jobs, a positive for housing demand. Further, if long-term mortgage rates are rising, some home buyers will turn to adjustable-rate mortgages to keep their mortgage costs relatively low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a larger perspective, I believe the U.S. economy will remain in a low-interest-rate environment for the remainder of this decade. Inflationary pressures remain low, and there is little indication of any serious future inflation. The only potential time bomb for the interest-rate outlook is the nation's swelling budget-deficit problem. If the federal government does not address the deficit problem in the near future, interest-rate pressures will rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: If the economy slows down again, would that burst the bubble in the housing market? Why or why not?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. TALBOTT: Economic slowdowns are what usually cause problems in the housing market. The reason is that until people have real difficulty making their mortgage payment, they are unlikely to be willing to part with their family's home. Loss of a job in an economic downturn is an event that might lead to foreclosure and possible personal bankruptcy. If there were an economic slowdown, the associated job losses would be catostrophic to the housing market and the bubble would most definitely burst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(MORE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of a weak economy causing a retraction in housing prices, which is the typical phenomena, here a collapsing housing market nationally . . . would dramatically lower house prices. This would increase foreclosures, cause greater bank losses and threaten major industry players. [This would be followed by] a general decline in the economy as banks retrenched in all areas of lending and labor mobility shrunk as workers were unable to sell their homes in order to move to new jobs . . . . The bill, in essence, would come due for all the carefree spending due to the home-refinancing wave that occurred when housing prices were booming, rates were low and credit was easy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, economic slowdowns are regional in nature, so Houston has a housing-price decline when oil prices contract and San Francisco and Boston have problems when the high-tech market stumbles. For there to be a truly national housing-price crash, there would have to be factors that are national, not regional, in scope. Higher interest rates, a corrupt mortgage system and our increasing reliance on a shaky global economy are all exactly those type of national factors, any one of which could cause a serious decline in housing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. LEREAH: I truly believe that if the economy slows down again, the housing sector would be the beneficiary. A weak economy means an accommodative Fed and falling interest rates. Mortgage rates would drop back toward their 45-year lows, reducing homeownership costs and stimulating the demand for home buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: Is housing construction running ahead of demand, setting up the potential for an oversupply of homes in the market? If so, how close are we to an oversupply situation?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. TALBOTT: People mistakenly point to the boom in house construction as a sign that the housing market is healthy and that prices are reasonable. Just the opposite is true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders are arbitrageurs. They see that home prices are overvalued in a particular area, and they quickly turn fairly priced wood and nails into overpriced homes to sell. Home builders need not be bullish on home prices. Home builders are sellers, not buyers, of homes. They depend on you to purchase the home, many times before construction has even started, and to bear the risk going forward [in regard to whether] the housing market is overvalued. Secondly, the amount of homes that can be built in any one year is a small percentage of the total supply outstanding. So the overall impact of the supply of new homes is greatly overexaggerated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no oversupply of homes in the market, but there very well may be if everyone decides to sell at the same time. Thinking of the housing markets only in terms of supply and demand ignores the fundamental concerns about the mortgage business that makes a correction inevitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. LEREAH: Housing construction is behind, not ahead of, demand, creating a tight supply of homes in the market. There are government-imposed growth restrictions in many areas across the nation that have inhibited housing construction. Home builders got caught with their financial pants down in the last housing contraction, in 1990 and 1991, and have been a bit more conservative this time around. For example, the supply of unsold homes in 1990-91 was about nine months, or double the months' supply today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: What are the riskiest regions of the country, in terms of a pricing bubble bursting? And do you think there is a high likelihood the markets there will experience actual price declines anytime soon? If so, what would it take for that to happen?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. TALBOTT: At first blush, it appears that the highest-priced areas of the country face the greatest risk if the bubble bursts. The wealthier communities, especially in the Northeast and West, have much higher average prices for homes, even relative to family incomes, and they have had the biggest percentage price appreciation over the past five years. This makes them very susceptible to a downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But housing-price declines will not be limited to the frothy, highly priced communities. The economy will suffer due to labor mobility declining if home prices decline and to bank-lending retrenchment. This means that the more moderate-income neighborhoods will begin to experience abnormal job losses, and foreclosures in those areas will grow, leading to home-price declines. The South is experiencing the greatest price declines in percentage terms right now, even though [that region] and the Midwest already have much lower-priced homes than the Western and Northeastern regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What will the trigger be? It could be higher rates. It could be that problems are exposed in the highly leveraged private-mortgage-insurance business. Or Fannie or Freddie may have problems. You can be certain in this kind of incestuous manic market, when it happens, everybody will claim complete surprise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, unlike other housing downturns, this will be truly national in scope, affecting all regions of the countries and all neighborhoods, both moderate and expensive. The decline has already started in the Midwest and the South, and as rates continue to rise, the [coastal regions] will also begin to decline. Housing markets don't typically realize their losses all at once as homeowners are slow to sell into weak markets. But the decline that has already begun will increase as rates increase and housing prices will fall nationally for three or four years before they stabilize again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. LEREAH: The great thing about mortgage rates is that they don't discriminate. If 30-year mortgage rates are 5.8% in the Northeast region, they are also 5.8% in the South, Midwest and West. Since mortgage rates are projected to stay relatively low -- below 6.4% -- for the remainder of the year, most regions and metropolitan areas of the nation will be spared any price bubbles bursting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regions are at risk when there is a concentrated loss of jobs, resulting in a sharp drop-off in home sales. Predicting local economic conditions is difficult from a national perspective. Local areas such as Nassau and Suffolk [counties in New York]; Orange County, Calif., and the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area have experienced several years of double-digit price appreciation. If these areas were to experience concentrated job losses, they could be vulnerable to price corrections. However, since the housing inventories in these areas are very tight, a sharp price decline would be unlikely at this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: Long term, do you think housing will remain a safe investment in the U.S.?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. TALBOTT: Housing will always be a much less volatile asset than other more speculative investments like high-tech stocks or options. But given the enormous amount of leverage in the housing sector, the equity held by the homeowner is a much more volatile asset than the underlying home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people moved into home buying as an investment alternative after having gotten burned in the high-tech boom of the late '90s. They correctly reasoned that homes were built of bricks and mortar and so were much less likely to evaporate in the future than some their Internet investments had. Unfortunately, these home buyers are not asking the fundamental question necessary for intelligent, productive investment: Yes, the home they are buying is beautiful, but what price are they paying for those bricks and mortar?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing will not be a safe investment looking forward. Price declines will erode investments and cause a dramatic increase in foreclosures and personal bankruptcies. It never makes economic sense to buy at the peak of a cycle. People who overpay, even for nice properties, end up kicking themselves for having been so stupid when times change -- and, oh, they always do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. LEREAH: During this past decade, real estate has surfaced as a relatively safe, wealth-building asset. The so-called real-estate boom has jumped over many obstacles and is still standing. It had to absorb the international financial crisis of 1998, a recession in 2001 and significant job losses in the 2002 to 2003 period. While many real-estate watchers like to attribute today's real-estate boom to low mortgage rates, that is only part of the story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technological advances in how houses are bought and sold, product innovation, and a continued high level of demand for homes by baby boomers, their children and new immigrants are just some of the reasons that the boom will continue into the next decade. Return on home investment will not fade away. Price bubbles are not about to burst. The long-term fundamentals for housing remain excellent into the foreseeable future.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Today's Market Forecast]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glass Houses</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After what happened to Dominion Homes, the bullish case for housing appears to be built on shaky foundations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday night, the Ohio home builder warned that its second-quarter results would fall short of expectations, citing a 15% drop-off in gross sales for April and May from the year-earlier period and a jump in cancellations that led to a 35% decline in net sales. Yesterday, Dominion Homes fell 15% on Nasdaq.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As far as the home builders go, Dominion is small potatoes. Operating in Ohio and Kentucky, it had sales of $563 million last year -- not much compared with the $9 billion or so in sales that Pulte Homes and Lennar each raked in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further, Dominion does about 70% of its business with first-time buyers -- people who are heavily dependent on financing and, as Dominion pointed out, are more likely to delay buying in a rising-rate environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That isn't the position that most of the big builders, which sell houses with higher price-points than Dominion, are likely to find themselves in. Their core customers have higher earnings, longer credit histories and, most important, equity that they have built up in the homes they already own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But just because the rise in rates may not affect outfits such as Toll Brothers as directly as it affected Dominion, big builders have reason to fret. To trade up into a bigger, more expensive home, a customer has to do something about the old home first. "First-time buyers are the suckers who are supposed to buy my house at its inflated price so I can move to a McMansion," says Northern Trust chief U.S. economist Paul Kasriel. "I might have a problem."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kasriel sees parallels between what has gone on with housing prices during the past several years and what went on with stocks in the late 1990s, complete with the chorus of onlookers chanting about how "this time is different."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If investors in housing stocks have fallen into a dangerous complacency on interest rates, so too, worries Yale professor Robert Shiller, have recent home buyers. These buyers feel extraordinarily low rates justify the high prices they've paid. What they're forgetting is that if they move, they may be paying a higher rate on their new mortgage, as will whoever is buying their old house. That scenario could lead to an unexpected "substantial loss," Mr. Shiller says. </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sydney -- ECONOMISTS LOOKING for clues about the future of the U.S. housing boom might want to take a look at Australia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the U.S., Australia has enjoyed a spectacular run-up in home values over the past few years, with prices more than doubling in some parts of the country. The reasons for the boom are similar, too: low interest rates, relatively easy credit and buyers seeking to offset stock-market losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is one critical difference, however. Home prices are still climbing in the U.S., but not so in Australia. According to Australian Property Monitors, a widely followed Sydney-based research firm, Sydney home prices fell 7.5% in the first quarter of 2004 and could tumble by 20% by the end of the year. Other Aussie cities are seeing price drops as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The divergence, many analysts believe, is the result of Australian policy-maker moves to rein in the country's inflated property market, primarily by raising interest rates. The U.S., by contrast, has largely left the housing market to run its course. But with the U.S. economy seemingly back on track and inflation possibly on the horizon, many analysts believe the U.S. Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, there are some very important differences between U.S. and Australian real estate. Recent U.S. home-price gains, while striking, haven't been as dramatic as those in Australia. Also, some unique factors have contributed to the Australian slowdown, including a new tax on investment properties that cooled speculative demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the recent retreat of the Aussie property sector serves as a potent reminder that no housing market -- even one insulated by relatively low interest rates and strong demand -- is trouble-free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the U.S., Australian home sales really began to heat up in the late 1990s. They got a boost from a rise in the number of mortgage brokers who, as in the U.S., provided a variety of new financing alternatives to buyers, including low-documentation loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BY 2002, home values were rising faster than incomes, pricing many first-time homebuyers out of the market. Debt levels were soaring, and houses were moving surprisingly fast at public auctions, one of the more popular ways of selling a home in Australia. In April 2002, auction "clearance" rates soared to a record 80%, meaning that four-fifths of the homes offered for auction sold by the end of public bidding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the market raced ahead, worries mounted. Much of the concern focused on the role of investors, many of whom had been burned by stocks and were pouring money into real estate. A report by the Reserve Bank of Australia noted that more than 40% of new home loans were being made to investors, compared with slightly more than 10% in the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a common belief that house prices cannot fall," the central bank warned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Reserve Bank raised its key interest rate twice in late 2003, to 5.25% from 4.75%. Although the increases weren't dramatic, they were enough to knock some first-time buyers out of the market. They also had a big psychological effect, spooking home shoppers who were already anxious about the market and were watching for any sign that Australia's business cycle was turning. Prices started to fall and clearance rates tumbled to as low as 32% -- about the same as in 1989, just before the last property bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A NEW WARINESS was evident among buyers at a recent auction in Sydney. The house for sale, a Victorian home with molded ceilings near Sydney's Centennial Park, was listed at about 1.1 million Australian dollars, or about US$765,000. About 20 or more people showed up, but many were onlookers who came simply to get a read on the uncertain market. One potential buyer, 53-year-old Brian Connell, put in a few bids but dropped out after the price rose. Despite the recent turn in the market, he said, many properties are still too expensive and prices could have more room to fall. The market "is like a game of musical chairs that everyone can play . . . and now they're taking chairs away," said Mr. Connell, an auto-parts importer. "I'm a bit nervous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house eventually sold for roughly its asking price. But real-estate agents and the seller said the house probably would have nabbed a lot more, perhaps US$100,000 more, just a few months earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Australian analysts are hopeful the market will soon stabilize. Interest rates remain low by historical standards. The prospect of massive foreclosures, a problem in the last housing slowdown, seems remote. "There's no sign of panic selling," says John McGrath, chief executive of McGrath Estate Agents, one of Sydney's most prominent property companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But others are less sanguine. For one thing, more supply is on the way. In Melbourne, construction is under way on an 88-story apartment tower that will be one of the biggest residential buildings in the world. In Sydney, some real-estate agents have begun refusing listings in downtown areas where there has been a lot of new apartment construction because they fear the units will be too hard to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property market is now "the biggest single economic vulnerability" in Australia, says Rory Robertson, an interest-rate strategist at Macquarie Bank in Sydney. Indeed, growth slowed significantly in the first quarter, and some economists worry that consumer spending will weaken due to cooler housing activity. Whatever happens, he says, "it's going to be quite a shock to some people that home prices actually can fall." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, a private research group, said that its May index of manufacturing activity, based on a survey of manufacturing purchasing managers, rose to 62.8, from 62.4 in April, marking 12 consecutive months of growth.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- U.S. manufacturers last month saw a slightly stronger pace of growth and the best rate of hiring since the early 1970s, while fretting over the rising prices of materials and energy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, a private research group, said that its May index of manufacturing activity, based on a survey of manufacturing purchasing managers, rose to 62.8, from 62.4 in April, marking 12 consecutive months of growth. Readings above 50 in any of the ISM's indexes point to expansion in activity and describe the breadth of that advance, but not necessarily the magnitude of the gain seen by individual survey respondents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute noted that "comments from respondents indicate demand is strong in most industries, but they also express major concerns about rising materials prices and the cost of energy in particular."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norbert Ore, who directs the survey for the ISM, said that "it appears that second-quarter growth will be very solid, and the momentum should carry over into the second half of the year," which is "shaping up as one of the better years for manufacturing."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If May's reading of 62.8 were to be maintained for an extended period of time, it would be consistent with a 7.3% annualized growth in the U.S. gross domestic product, according to the report.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM said its new-orders index slipped to 62.8 in May from 65 in the previous month, while the production index also softened, sliding to 64.8 from 67.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group's employment index, meanwhile, increased to 61.9 after the 57.8 in April. The May gain was the best since April 1973, and soared over the 48 reading that denotes growth in the government's statistics on factory hiring.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price pressures continued to be a major concern for the factory sector. The prices index stood at 86 in May, compared with 88 in April. The price gains were broad-based.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department reported that construction spending rose 1.3% in April from March, after an upwardly revised 2.4% increase in March. Residential private construction rose 1.2%, while nonresidential private construction rose 1.3%.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Kemba J. Dunham </div><div>773 words</div><div>27 May 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two Commerce Department reports hinted at some cooling in the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new single-family homes fell 11.8% in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.093 million units, the biggest percentage decline in about 10 years. March home sales were revised up to a 9.7% increase to 1.239 million from an earlier estimated 8.9% increase in demand to 1.228 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, Commerce reported that orders for durable goods -- items generally expected to last more than three years -- declined 2.9% to $191.3 billion last month, after rising by 5.7% (revised from 5%) in March and 3.9% in February. The decline included a 4.7% drop in orders for transportation equipment and a 4.1% decline in orders for computers and other electronics equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists are watching closely for signs of weakness in housing, because the sector is very sensitive to rising interest rates. But some economists weren't alarmed by the decline in sales. David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders in Washington, D.C., says that poor weather conditions accounted for a lack of home buying early in the year. When those conditions improved in March, new home sales surged and were bound to cool off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I knew there was going to be some decline in April, because the March number was an all-time high and couldn't be sustained," Mr. Seiders said. "We do have a gradually declining pattern from the first quarter, but we're not viewing this as a collapse."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories for new-home sales rose in April to 4.3 months of supply, the highest level since February 2003. Though the level of unsold homes is rising, economists said inventory levels below six months of supply are still indicative of a tight housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While new-home sales fell in April, existing-home sales rose last month at a rapid pace, jumping 2.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.64 million units from March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These reports are correlated over time, but it isn't unusual for them to move in different directions from month to month. The Commerce Department's report on new-home sales gives a more up-to-date picture of housing activity since it counts deals that have gone to contract. The National Association of Realtors' report on existing-home sales counts only closed deals that may have gone into contract 60 days ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking the reports together, Douglas Duncan, chief economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association, said, "We're approaching the peak [in housing] here." But he added that according to his association's tracking, mortgage applications remain robust, suggesting the housing sector has strong underpinnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the report on durable goods, nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- seen as an especially important indicator of business spending -- fell 3.5% in April after rising 6% the month before. However shipments in this category were up 0.7% in April after rising 3.5% the month before, suggesting that if a slowdown is building in business investment, it hadn't yet showed up as the second quarter began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for new goods and equipment like cars and computers are followed closely by economists as a leading indicator of future economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall estimates on durable goods are volatile and subject to revision. As a result, analysts caution against using monthly figures when trying to tell where the U.S. economy is heading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many economists said the April number was weaker than expected, they didn't see the latest data as too alarming. The latest figures "are just noise; this is just some sort of correction," said Arun Raha, an economist with Cleveland-based Eaton Corp., a manufacturing company that makes brakes, cockpit controls and other products. "Demand remains strong and next month, the numbers will be back up."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Gregory Zuckerman  </div><div>1087 words</div><div>27 May 2004</div><div>The Asian Wall Street Journal</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2004 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INTEREST RATES are rising and the U.S. housing market may finally be showing some cracks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why are some value-oriented stock investors starting to look at home builders and home-furnishing companies?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are trained to dump housing-related stocks when rates jump. The move makes intuitive sense: Rising interest rates make homes more expensive, putting a damper on the price of existing homes and making it harder for home builders to sell their wares. Rising commodity prices are sending some building materials higher, another reason to worry about these companies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As if on cue, many investors bailed out of these stocks when rates started moving higher in March. The Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index fell 21% between March 16 and May 19. But the stocks have ticked higher in the past few days. On Tuesday, the home-building group rose after a stronger-than-expected report from the National Association of Realtors on sales of existing homes in April.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the potential troubles for the business, the recent weakness created a buying opportunity, some investors say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, the housing market is going to be hurt and profits for home builders might slip. But shares are relatively cheap and profits in the business are so juicy that it likely will take big troubles in the housing market for these stocks to be crippled.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While mortgage rates have climbed to 6% again, lenders are shifting to more-affordable adjustable and hybrid loans, reducing the possibility that the housing market will crater. Most important, the largest builders continue to grab market share from local builders, a trend that should help the stocks over the long haul.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If mortgage rates go above 7.5%, you start to worry, but rates are still relatively low," says Scott Black, president of Delphi Management Inc., a Boston money-management firm that owns some of the largest builders. "These are the Rodney Dangerfield stocks of the Big Board" because they get so little respect.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, bulls on housing stocks are making the risky bet that things will be different this time around. During the past 11 periods of rising interest rates, home-construction stocks fell, albeit a slim 2%, according to RiskMetrics Group, a risk-analytics firm. Housing prices have soared so high in the past few years that things are bound to cool off, slowing home sales. And if inflation keeps rising, the U.S. Federal Reserve may have to conduct a series of interest-rate increases, possibly sending mortgage rates much higher.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for those investors willing to wager that mortgage rates won't approach 8% soon, housing-related stocks look attractive, some say. The home-building business is profitable, with the big builders all earning more than 25% on their money.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike most stocks in the market, home builders appear cheap, and the recent selloff has made them even more inexpensive.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar Corp., for example, trades at just 8.3 times expected earnings for 2004, while KB Home sells at a multiple of 6.4 times this year's expected earnings. These stocks have been trading at puny multiples of earnings amid worries about a break in the housing market, but current prices are especially low. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 trades at more than 17 times 2004's expected earnings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key for these companies is how they use their size to edge out smaller, local builders. The big players receive lower prices for building supplies and get better financing from lenders than smaller builders, selling bonds instead of relying on mercurial bank lending, for example. The major builders also do a better job scooping up scarce land for new homes, since they have staffs of specialists better able to gain environmental and zoning approvals. It helped the 10 largest companies build 22% of all new single-family homes last year, up from less than 9% as recently as 1996.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If interest rates go up the industry likely will slow," but profits will be large enough to help the stocks, says Ed Wachenheim III, chairman of Greenhaven Associates Inc., a money-management firm that owns stock in many home builders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other investors note that inventories of homes are lower than in past periods of rising interest rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adds Scott Grotjan, an analyst at Gemini Investment Strategies LLC, a Parsippany, New Jersey, hedge fund: "There's more creativity with mortgages; people are using hybrid mortgages and adjustables that make housing more affordable in a rising interest-rate environment."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another good sign: Executives at some of these companies are buying shares of their own companies at a rate that surpasses most other industries. As of last week, home-building executives sold only $5.8 million of their shares in May while buying $1 million of shares, the least selling in relation to buying since March 2003 (selling usually outstrips buying, as executives raise money for various personal expenses). In comparison, last month insiders at these companies sold $14.50 of shares for every $1 acquired and in March they sold $27.4 million in stock without doing any buying.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Insider sentiment within the home-building space flashed its most bullish signal in a year this month, driven by bargain hunting at small- and midcap firms," says Kevin Schwenger, an analyst at Thomson Financial.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the home builders, Lennar and Toll Brothers Inc., which focus on wealthier home buyers, are seen as safer bets. "Over 50% of their buyers don't use a mortgage" to buy their homes, says Mr. Black, so rising rates have less of an impact on their sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">D.R. Horton Inc., which specializes in first-time buyers, may be more dangerous if all the debt that less-wealthy consumers piled up starts to crimp their spending as rates rise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Sowerby, portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles &amp; Co. in Detroit, is a bigger fan of home-improvement and furnishing companies. He likes Masco Corp., Leggett &amp; Platt Inc., Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. and Lowe's Cos. Rather than splurging on a new home, more consumers might invest in their existing homes, helping these companies. Home Depot Inc. is another favorite among investors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These stocks are more correlated to real income" rather than interest rates, he argues, suggesting there is more upside ahead as the economy continues to grow.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These stocks are more correlated to real income" rather than interest rates, he argues, suggesting there is more upside ahead as the economy continues to grow. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fear of higher interest rates drove home resales to an annual rate of 6.64 million units last month, the National Association of Realtors said. That was a 2.5% advance from March's 6.48-million-unit annual pace. The April activity marked the fastest pace of resales this year and the second-fastest pace on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers have an incentive to act if they believe rates will keep rising. Federal Reserve officials have signaled recently that they are likely to nudge short-term interest rates higher in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Longer-term rates have already started rising, though it remains unclear if they will keep going up. According to Freddie Mac, the national average rate for a 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgage rose to 6.30% in late May from 5.38% in mid-March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. consumer confidence crept up in May. The Conference Board's consumer-confidence index rose to 93.2 from a revised level of 93 in April, the New York research group said yesterday. April's reading was originally reported as 92.9. The present-situation index came in at 90.3, compared with 90.4 last month, while the expectations index edged up to 95.2 from 94.8.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of respondents saying they found jobs "plentiful" rose to 16.6 in May from 15.6 in April, the highest reading since August 2002. However, the share of respondents saying jobs were "hard to get" remained elevated as well, rising 2.6 points to 30.6. The survey polls 5,000 U.S. households on their feelings about the U.S. economy. The index was equal to 100 in 1985.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, a report by the International Monetary Fund projected that the U.S. economy should experience a "robust" expansion in 2004, creating an opportunity for the government to reduce deficits in preparation for higher pension and health costs in the years ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The IMF's annual review of the U.S. economy also said the Bush administration has raised "justifiable concerns" over the large and increasing share of mortgage-backed securities held by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The growth of these government sponsored enterprises has "concentrated interest rate and mortgage prepayment risk," the IMF said, lending its support to the administration's proposal to overhaul supervision of the institutions.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Queena Sook Kim and James R. Hagerty </div><div>1289 words</div><div>26 May 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FEARFUL HOME buyers are jumping into the market, worried that they will get priced out by rising interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes continued at a torrid pace in April, rising 2.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.64 million units from March. The national median home price in April was $176,000, up 7.3% from a year earlier, the National Association of Realtors reported yesterday. So far this year, home sales are running at the second-highest pace on record, and the association expects May home sales to remain strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market is being fueled in part by anxious home buyers who want to lock into a mortgage before rates get any higher, says David Lereah, the chief economist at NAR. "Every time you get a jump in interest rates, people jump off the fence and you see an uptick in the buying," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If interest rates hit 7%, Mr. Lereah expects the pace of home sales to slow. At 8%, he expects the rate of price appreciation to slow too. However, Mr. Lereah says the housing market will remain healthy by historical standards and doesn't expect a downward correction in home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climbing rates are also prompting sellers to move more quickly. Van Davis, chief executive officer of Century 21 Real Estate Corp., a subsidiary of Cendant Corp., said homeowners are rushing to list their homes for sale while the market is still ripe. This has increased the supply of homes on the market and increased the inventory of unsold homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of strong gains fueled by the lowest interest rates in decades, the cost of borrowing has risen by more than one percentage point during the past two months. Interest rates on a 30-year-fixed-rate mortgage have climbed to about 6.3%, up from about 5.1% in June 2003, when rates hit their lowest level in more than 40 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some builders are pushing adjustable-rate mortgages to lower monthly payments, and note that buyers can offset higher interest costs by dispensing with optional features like fancy countertops. Additionally, some home builders appear to be driving short-term sales by offering "cap-rate float-down" mortgages. The mortgage product allows home buyers to lock in today's rates for up to a year. If interest rates dip, home buyers can go with the lower rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homebuilders Financial Network, a provider of mortgage services to regional builders, says use of such loans among its clients nearly tripled in April and accounted for 16% of the 1,800 loans it administered that month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Indianapolis, home builder Estridge Co. offered the cap-rate float-down as an incentive and saw its contracts increase 50% so far this month, compared with May 2003. "We told home buyers, `This is your last opportunity to get in on low rates,' " says Mike Keller, the company's chief financial officer. "We basically doubled our business."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Maple Valley, Wash., the housing market earlier this year was relatively dormant. The number of homes sold had dipped in January, and the area seemed immune to the multiple offers on homes and housing shortages that drove up prices in nearby Seattle. But business picked up in February, and in April home sales rose 21% year over year as the median home price hit $289,500 -- 8.3% higher than a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers like Danene Honemann and her husband Greg, both 36 years old, were among those responsible for the spike. The Honemanns weren't planning to buy a house until later this year. In early March, the couple plunked down a deposit for a new home to be delivered later in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Honemanns grew nervous that rising interest rates would make monthly payments unaffordable. So the couple put a 30-day lock on a 5.125% interest rate, a day before rates edged up one-quarter of a point, and began looking for an existing home. In March, a listing for a $330,000 ranch popped up at 6 p.m.; three hours later, the Honemanns submitted a bid that was accepted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We weren't going to dicker with the house," says Ms. Honemann. "If our payments went up by even $100, we would have had to seriously think about backing away from buying a home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Brown, a manager at a computer-services company, watched interest rates with growing anxiety this spring. He was eager to trade up from his house in Totowa, N.J., to a larger one in nearby Wayne. Mr. Brown figured the move wouldn't be affordable if rates on a 30-year-fixed mortgage climbed above 6.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So early this month, Mr. Brown put his house on the market and within three days got his first bid, almost exactly at the asking price of $350,000. Although more offers seemed likely, Mr. Brown "grabbed the first offer" rather than risk a further rise in interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest spike in April home prices came in the Northeast, where prices rose 19% to a median of $214,000, and the West, where homes appreciated by 12% to $257,000. In some markets -- such as California, parts of Florida and the Washington, D.C., suburbs -- demand for housing is so strong and supply so tight that the recent rise in interest rates has barely caused a ripple in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Virginia suburbs of Washington, prices have been rising about 2% a month, says Michael Turk, managing broker at Weichert Realtors in Alexandria, Va. In such markets, fear of higher prices next month is a stronger motivator than fear of higher rates. Many houses in the Washington suburbs are selling within days of being listed. Earlier this month, Mr. Turk says, one house in Alexandria attracted 42 offers and sold for about $480,000, $85,000 above the listing price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Santa Cruz County, Calif., near Silicon Valley, the median home price hit $603,125 in March -- a 15% increase from the year-earlier period -- and Realtors say there are no signs of the market softening. "Interest rates are clicking up and that's causing more demand," says Paul Bailey, a real-estate broker in Aptos, Calif. "At the same time there's low supply and therefore this is driving prices up."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumer confidence rose slightly in May, bolstered by better labor-market conditions.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The pickup in the job market is offsetting the impact of rising gas prices and escalating tensions overseas," said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's consumer-research center, in a news release.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of respondents saying they found jobs "plentiful" rose to 16.6 in May from 15.6 in April, the highest reading since August 2002.  </p>

</div><div class="author">A Wall Street Journal News Roundup </div><div>411 words</div><div>19 May 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. home-building sector appears to be slowing as mortgage rates rise, but the deceleration so far hasn't been sharp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported that the number of new residential units under construction fell 2.1% in April from March, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.97 million. Economists had expected a decline of 1.3% to a rate of 1.98 million units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With mortgage rates climbing, many economists have been expecting the housing market to cool from the fevered pace of the past few years. Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages have increased to more than 6% in recent weeks, averaging 6.34% plus a 0.7-point fee for the week ended Thursday, according to Freddie Mac. Nonetheless, analysts say, job growth and rates that remain low by historical standards should underpin the sector in the short term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though housing starts declined in April, March starts were revised slightly higher, to an annual rate of 2.011 million units from 2.007 million. February's construction numbers were revised up to a rate of 1.895 million units from 1.887 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the April report showed that building permits, an indicator of future new-home construction, rose in April by 1.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of two million units. And the National Association of Home Builders' index for sales of new single-family homes came in at 69 in May, the same as its April level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those indicators gave economists a sense that the expected slowdown should be modest. "The recent bounce in mortgage rates will likely take a toll on housing as 2004 unfolds; however, stronger wage and job growth should temper the decline," economists at UBS Securities wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department report showed starts of single-family units fell 0.6% in April. The overall decline was concentrated in the apartment and condominium sector, which dropped 12.5%. Housing starts rose in all regions except for the West, where they fell 13.7%. Starts rose 4.5% in the Northeast, 1.2% in the South and 0.6% in the Northeast.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. home-building sector appears to be slowing as mortgage rates rise, but the deceleration so far hasn't been sharp.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Commerce Department reported the number of new residential units under construction fell 2.1% in April from March, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.97 million. Economists had expected a decline of 1.3% to a 1.98 million annual rate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With mortgage rates climbing, many economists have been expecting the housing market to cool from the fevered pace seen in the past few years. Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages have edged up to more than 6% in recent weeks, averaging 6.34% plus a 0.7-point fee for the week ended May 13, according to Freddie Mac.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, analysts say, job growth and still-low rates should underpin the sector in the short term.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though housing starts declined in April, March starts were revised slightly higher, to a 2.011-million-unit construction rate from a 2.007 million rate. February's construction numbers also were revised up to a 1.895-million-unit rate from a previous estimate of 1.887 million units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the April report showed building permits, an indicator of future new-home construction, rose in April by 1.2% to a seasonally adjusted two million annual rate. And the National Association of Home Builders' index for sales of new single-family homes came in at 69 in May, the same as its April level.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those indicators gave economists a sense that the expected slowdown should be modest. "The recent bounce in mortgage rates will likely take a toll on housing as 2004 unfolds; however, stronger wage and job growth should temper the decline," economists at UBS Securities wrote in a note to clients.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing-starts report showed starts of single-family units fell 0.6% in April. The overall decline was concentrated in the apartment and condominium-building sector, which dropped 12.5%. Housing starts rose in all regions except for the West, where they fell 13.7%. Housing starts rose 4.5% in the Midwest, 1.2% in the South and 0.6% in the Northeast.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Simon </div><div>1254 words</div><div>12 May 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AFTER A TORRID PERIOD of rising prices in virtually every other price segment, the lagging high end of the housing market is finally starting to heat up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Naples, Fla., area, sales of homes priced between $2 million and $5 million jumped 96% during the first four months of 2004 over the same time last year, while sales of homes priced above $5 million surged 157%. In Greater Seattle, 48 homes priced above $2 million sold or were under contract this year through April, up from just 13 during the same period last year. And in California, there's now about a four-month supply of $1 million-and-up homes on the market, down from a nearly nine-month supply in March 2003, according to the California Association of Realtors. At Sotheby's International Realty, a unit of Cendant Corp. that sells high-end homes in 22 markets, revenues rose 95% in the first four months of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not just markets like Beverly Hills and the Hamptons that are hot. When Jerry and Debbi Zarrella put their 7,200-square-foot home in East Greenwich, R.I., on the market last winter, there weren't many lookers. But this spring, three buyers put in bids for the home, which has a two-story master bedroom suite with an exercise room and a sauna. A bidding war broke out, and the couple sold the house in April for $2.6 million, $100,000 more than the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the relatively low number of high-end homes in any market means that even a small number of sales can carry a lot of weight. And the definition of "high end" depends a lot on where you live: A house priced at $1 million in many places is considered high-end. In Beverly Hills, it's a one- or two-bedroom condominium. As a result, data for national high-end home sales are hard to come by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the consensus of real-estate firms in many areas is that after a long period of trailing the rest of the market, high-end home sales are finally taking off -- and they're not confined to states like Florida, an especially attractive place for high-end buyers because it imposes no state income tax. Florida also has a homestead protection law that protects houses from being seized by creditors, a factor for some buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, demand has been far stronger for starter homes and midpriced properties, with low mortgage rates turning renters into buyers and encouraging many homeowners to trade up. Overall, home prices climbed 7.5% in 2003, according to the National Association of Realtors. The recent jump in mortgage rates has only helped fuel demand as buyers scramble to close deals before rates move even higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But upper-end buyers are less sensitive to changing interest rates. Sales were hit first by the post-boom stock-market downturn and then, more recently, by a weak economy and anxieties over war in Iraq. In cities such as Denver, San Francisco and San Jose, prices for high-end homes flattened or even dropped in the last few years, according to Fiserv CSW, a research firm. Last year "was not a banner year for anybody," says John Brian Losh, publisher of the "Who's Who in Luxury Real Estate" directory, which tracks the luxury market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with the economy on the upswing and with the stock market rebounding over the past year, many high-end buyers are feeling more optimistic. One sign of the changing mood: The confidence of chief executives in the U.S. economy surged in the first quarter to its highest level in 20 years, according to the Conference Board, a nonprofit membership organization that regularly surveys CEOs in a variety of industries. The generous tax cuts enacted over the past few years have also put more cash in wealthy buyers' pockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the recent dip in stock prices could be a plus, provided it doesn't put too much of a dent in a buyer's net worth. "We're a safe haven," says Stuart Siegel, head of Sotheby's brokerage arm. "We get the flight capital."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many ways, the high end functions as a separate real-estate market. It's driven more by the broader economic picture and the stock market than by interest-rate changes. Additionally, because there's such a big leap in prices from the middle level to the high end, there's less of a "trickle-down effect" to the rest of the market when high-end prices increase, says Rajeev Dhawan, director of the economic forecasting center at Georgia State University's business school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real-estate experts, such as Mr. Siegel, are concerned the rebound could be short-lived. Inventories are tight in many areas, and that hurts sales. Plus, worries about inflation, rising interest rates and the war in Iraq could lead some buyers to tighten their purse strings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there a few signs that sales could soon be slowing down in some markets. In the Boston area, "the high end is getting a little bit more challenging," says Alan Rice, a senior vice president of Hammond/GMAC Real Estate. "There are more properties on the market in that price range and they are staying longer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greg Scott, a real-estate broker in New Haven, Conn., says sales of properties priced above $1 million picked up in the first quarter. "But I do sense a slight shift in the market," he adds. "People are a tad more cautious than they had been."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, though, people like Jim McMahon, a builder in Hinsdale, Ill., who specializes in high-end homes, are benefiting from the rebound. In the fourth quarter, he says, business was so slow you could "forget about traffic. We weren't even getting phone calls." Last week, however, Mr. McMahon sold a $4.6 million stone and cedar house with a wrap-around porch that sits on a three-quarter acre lot. He also has buyers interested in two other homes, priced at $5.75 million and $3.3 million. "There's a general sense of well-being," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things are even steamier in Los Angeles, where demand far outstrips supply. In the tony Bel Air district, one house sold yesterday for $16 million, $2.5 million above the asking price. The buyers plan to tear it down and rebuild. "Sellers are putting these high prices on [houses], and what's incredible is that they are getting them," says Jeff Hyland, the real-estate broker who handled the sale. The supply of homes on the market is so thin, Mr. Hyland says, that he has his agents calling former clients and asking if they "would like to sell and make a couple of million dollars."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other areas, prices have come down enough to encourage buyers to come out of the woodwork. "Prices were too high last year," says Jane Powers, a broker with Ewing &amp;Clark Inc. in Seattle. Now, she says, more sellers are pricing their homes under $2 million and sales in the $1 million to $2 million range are up 137%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recovery of the nation's manufacturing sector remained on course last month, but rising prices are starting to worry some factory operators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, an association of supply managers that polls purchasing agents at more than 400 industrial companies each month, said its index of manufacturing activity registered 62.4 in April, down slightly from March's 62.5 but still at a level indicative of strong growth. Any reading above 50 indicates the manufacturing sector is expanding; for the past six months, the ISM's index has been above 60.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the ISM said the pricing index rose to 88 in April, from 86 in March. The last time the index registered a rating higher than 88 was in November 1979, when the index was 89.2 and the nation had double-digit inflation. In yesterday's report, the ISM said that 77% of supply executives surveyed reported paying higher prices last month, while 1% reported paying lower prices and 22% reported that prices were unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department said total construction spending rose 1.5% in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $944.1 billion. It was the largest increase since July. The increase followed an upwardly revised 0.4% increase in February. Spending for that month originally was estimated as a 0.1% decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM survey also provided encouraging job news. The employment index rose to 57.8 in April from 57 in March. It was the sixth consecutive month that the employment index was over 48. The ISM's news release stated that an employment index above 48 over time is generally consistent with an increase in manufacturing jobs. However, the government's employment report has shown no pickup in hiring, although the March employment report indicated that factories had stopped cutting jobs. The employment report for the month of April is due to be released Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The manufacturing sector is in the middle of a recovery and the trends are very well established," says Norbert J. Ore, who heads the committee that conducts the ISM survey. In recent years, "manufacturing-sector demand has been" hurt by distractions and disasters, including the 2001 terrorists attacks and numerous corporate-accounting scandals. But now, he says, "business is doing extremely well." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Consumer confidence in the U.S. economy surged in April as the job picture brightened, a Conference Board survey found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board, a nonprofit research group based in New York, said its consumer-confidence index this month stood at 92.9, up from a revised 88.5 in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The job market, which has a major impact on confidence, appears to be gaining strength" and that has provided a major boost to sentiment levels, said Conference Board economist Lynn Franco. The results are based on a survey of 5,000 U.S. households. The portion of consumers who claimed jobs are "hard to get" fell to 27.6% from 29.9% in March. Those saying jobs are "plentiful" grew to 15.8% from 14.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers' optimism about the next six months improved for the first time this year, with 20.5% of participants expecting business conditions to improve, up from 19.5% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, home buyers rushing to grab low mortgage rates lifted U.S. home resales in March, the U.S. National Association of Realtors said. Sales of previously owned homes climbed 5.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6,480,000 units in March from an upwardly revised 6,130,000 in February. The March pace was the highest since September's 6,680,000 level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing needs of a growing population timed nicely with historically low interest rates and a rebounding economy in March," said David Lereah, the trade group's chief economist.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Work-force housing, or homes for families with earnings near the U.S. median income, is getting its first big lift from major financial institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citibank, Washington Mutual Inc. and other banks are committing a total of $57 million to a private equity fund dedicated to building homes in Los Angeles's inner city. The Genesis Workforce Housing Fund will provide equity investments to developers constructing single-family homes and condominiums in Los Angeles, where the median home price has skyrocketed to $375,000. Genesis will fund "infill" development, or construction on parcels of land inside cities. Most homes will be priced between $200,000 and $400,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund was created by Genesis LA Economic Growth Corp., a nonprofit dedicated to sparking economic development in Los Angeles, and is being led by New York-based real-estate investment company Phoenix Realty Group. Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co., Milwaukee, and Los Angeles-based Far East Bank also are contributing to the fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If successful in Los Angeles, the Genesis fund is expected to catch in other cities with affordable-housing crunches, including Boston and San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we're going to see these kinds of funds pop-up in urban areas," says Evelyn Kenvin, director of investments for Citibank community development, a division of Citibank. The bank, which is a unit of New York-based Citigroup Inc., will contribute as much as $10 million to the fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Institutional investors have been reluctant to fund such projects in major metropolitan areas. In hot housing markets like Los Angeles, the homes often are built in abandoned industrial neighborhoods where land is more affordable. Such sites often require environmental cleanup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the Genesis group's first project entails building 165 condominiums in Lincoln Heights, a neighborhood just north of downtown Los Angeles where two major freeways cross. The site, once the home of a furniture factory, was contaminated. Junkyards and vacant buildings surround the site. One of the development's main draws is its proximity to a light-rail station that opened in 2003. The homes will be priced to be affordable to families making between $44,000 and $110,000 a year, or 80% to 200% of the median income, which is $55,100 in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most investors are reticent about going into these areas because it's a pioneering effort," says Percy Vaz, the president of AMCAL Multi-Housing Inc., the Westlake Village, Calif.-based developer that will be constructing Genesis' first project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Genesis group believes that if the Lincoln Heights development is successful more builders and investors will take an interest in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund plans to raise an additional $43 million. Institutional investors like Seattle-based Washington Mutual will meet obligations as set out by the Community Investment Act, a federal regulation that requires institutions to invest in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builders have been trying to develop these sites for years now but there was no traction," says Debbie La Franchi, a consultant and former chief executive of Genesis LA. "Hopefully we're helping developers build a track record and showing other people that there's a money to be made in these investments." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The job market, which has a major impact on confidence, appears to be gaining strength" and that has provided a major boost to sentiment levels, said Conference Board economist Lynn Franco. The results are based on a survey of 5,000 U.S. households.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The portion of consumers who claimed jobs are "hard to get" fell to 27.6% from 29.9% during March. Those saying jobs are "plentiful" grew to 15.8% from 14.7%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers' optimism about the next six months improved for the first time this year, with 20.5% of participants expecting business conditions to improve, up from 19.5% last month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, home buyers rushing to grab low mortgage rates lifted U.S. home resales during March, the U.S. National Association of Realtors said yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes climbed 5.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6,480,000 units in March from an upwardly revised 6,130,000 in February. The March pace was the highest since September's 6,680,000 level.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing needs of a growing population timed nicely with historically low interest rates and a rebounding economy in March," David Lereah, the trade group's chief economist said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Spurred by continued low mortgage rates, new-home sales surged 8.9% in March, the largest monthly increase in nine months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new, single-family houses rose to a record seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,228,000 units last month, up from the revised rate of 1,128,000 units in February, the U.S. Commerce Department reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buying probably will remain robust because of a strong economy and a rebounding labor market.

The Fed's current target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, is now at a 46-year low of 1%, after the central bank made 13 cuts in a row to pull the economy out of recession and nurture it past a series of shocks including the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage-finance giant Freddie Mac reported last week that the national average for the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 5.94%, the highest level since December.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- When U.S. Federal Reserve officials meet in two weeks, they are likely to conclude that the economic outlook has strengthened and inflation is a little less quiescent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the past few weeks, U.S. government reports have shown much stronger job growth and retail sales and bigger increases in consumer prices than private economists and Fed officials expected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These developments are almost certainly too tentative for the Fed to raise interest rates at its meeting on May 4. But the central bank will likely continue what officials refer to as "verbal tightening" of monetary policy: altering the statement that follows the meeting to convey that conditions for such an increase are falling into place. Fed policy makers' purpose is twofold: to be candid in their economic views, and to adjust investors' expectations so that when the Fed finally does lift rates, it isn't a surprise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most likely changes to the Fed's statement are a recognition that U.S. job growth is improving following March's 308,000 jump in nonfarm jobs, a four-year high, and that the inflation rate has stopped falling. So Fed policy makers will probably say the risks of inflation are balanced, unlike recent statements that warned of a small risk of it falling too far.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the Fed repeats that it can be "patient" about raising interest rates isn't so certain. Some officials might press to drop the phrase to give themselves more latitude to raise rates quickly if the U.S. economic expansion remains surprisingly sturdy. Markets might interpret that as a signal rates could rise in June. (They now see August as the most likely time for an increase.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Fed governor Donald Kohn said in a recent speech that "patient" doesn't only mean the Fed can be slow to start raising its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, and now at a 46-year-low of 1%. It could also mean that the Fed starts soon, but is slow to return the rate to a normal level.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under that logic, the Fed could retain its commitment to patience. As long as markets understood that logic, the commitment wouldn't preclude the Fed from raising rates whenever it likes, but would discourage investors from pricing in a rapid series of rate increases.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts argue the Fed is already "behind the curve," letting inflationary pressure build dangerously. As evidence, they point to the 0.4% jump in consumer prices excluding food and energy in March, the biggest since late 2001.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Fed officials don't share that view. First, they figure that 0.4% translates to a less alarming 0.2% to 0.3% rise in the lesser-known index of personal-consumption expenditures, their preferred inflation gauge. Second, the past year's sharp jump in energy and commodity prices, which recently fed through to consumers, is leveling off. Third, and perhaps most important, rising productivity and soft wage gains are still pushing down labor costs, the most important determinant of inflation pressure.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is apparent in the latest U.S. manufacturing data. On Friday, the Fed reported that industrial production declined 0.2% in March from February, the first drop since May. Much of that was due to a decline in utilities output. Manufacturing production was unchanged, as declining auto assemblies were offset by increased output of food, chemicals and computers. Manufacturers used just 75.2% of capacity during March, down from 75.3% in February.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the number of hours worked at manufacturers fell during March, implying that output per hour -- productivity -- actually rose a healthy 0.4%. That's faster than the 0.2% increase in hourly wages, so adjusted for productivity, factory labor costs declined in March. Indeed, while manufacturers continue to report buoyant sales gains, high unemployment has put a lid on manufacturing wage increases, which have slowed to 1.9% from 3.2% a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While job creation in the U.S. has picked up, more than a million workers stopped looking for jobs in recent years, many of whom will now resume the hunt, holding up the unemployment rate. Unused factory capacity, high unemployment and healthy increases in "productivity will help keep inflation under control for the next couple of years," Fed governor Ben Bernanke said last week.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, officials are watching developments that could change their currently optimistic view on inflation. U.S. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has argued that some increase in prices is inevitable as companies reverse unsustainable discounts offered when the economy was much weaker.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only when price increases reflect accelerating cost pressures will alarm bells sound. One warning sign: The surprising 1.8% jump in retail sales for March, combined with upward revisions to January and February sales, show surprisingly strong consumer spending.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Commerce Department also said Friday that housing starts jumped 6.4% to an annual rate of 2.007 million in March from February, fueled by low mortgage rates. That broad strength in consumer demand is giving many companies the ability to raise prices, and Fed officials suspect that before long it will also lead to higher wages.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Today's Market Forecast]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acid-Test Failure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the revolution in CEO pay hasn't happened by now, fear for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been plenty of hopeful anecdotes that corporate boards are finally getting serious about reining in CEO pay. The only hitch is what the numbers actually say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median realized pay for CEOs at 350 of the largest companies was $3.6 million in 2003, according to Mercer Human Resource Consulting. That is 19% higher than the median from 2002 of $3.02 million. (Since Mercer's sample is different each year, the firm says viewing that percentage difference as an increase can be misleading. On an apples-to-apples basis, CEOs' realized pay was up 16.4% last year, a faster pace than the 15% increase in 2002.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mercer measures CEO pay several ways. It calculates how much CEOs "realized" in a given year, counting gains on options in that year, restricted stock and long-term incentives. The firm also measures "expected" compensation, adding things such as an estimated value for option grants. CEOs had a pretty good year in "expected" compensation, too. The median CEO made $6.21 million last year, compared with the $6.1 million made by the median CEO in 2002, a rise of 1.8% in the median. Robin Ferracone, a compensation expert at Mercer, says that a hopeful sign is that on that same-CEO basis, this expected pay went down 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That $6.2 million in expected pay is 19% higher than the median CEO pay for 2000 and it was the highest at any time in the past 10 years, except for 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median white-collar worker made $46,100 a year in 2003, up 3.3% from the median in 2002, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking merely at the median of the CEO pack can blur the issue, which is about excessive pay at the top tier. The CEO at the 90th percentile took home $15.2 million in 2003, meaning 10% of CEOs earned that much or more. In 2002, that figure was at $12.6 million. So what exactly is being reined in?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CEOs were selling stock aggressively last year as their stocks rose for the first time in years. So it is notable that they are sitting on an increased amount of their companies' stocks. The value of CEOs' stock ownership, at the median, was $9.1 million compared with a $6.8 million median in 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warren Buffett has called CEO pay the acid test of corporate improvement. The problem is value for money. Most of the top CEOs didn't invent anything nor are they are entrepreneurs. They are custodians. Yes, they are caretakers with big responsibilities -- but not that big.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Greg Ip </div><div>844 words</div><div>2 April 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The already buoyant manufacturing sector accelerated in March, and manufacturers' hiring activity hit a 16-year high, a widely watched survey found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing activity rose to 62.5 in March from 61.4 in February. Any reading above 50 indicates an expanding factory sector. The readings, based on a survey of purchasing managers at U.S.-based manufacturing facilities, in recent months have been the strongest in 20 years and have historically corresponded to annual economic growth of more than 6%, the institute said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strength was broad-based, with 19 of 20 industries surveyed reporting increased production and new orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing's resurgence is due in part to the depths to which it fell during the recession and weak recovery of 2001-2003 because of plunging capital spending, weak exports hampered by a strong dollar and Herculean efforts to reduce inventories. In the process, some three million factory jobs were wiped out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in recent months, capital spending, exports and inventory restocking have all begun to improve, and manufacturing employment may have started growing again for the first time in almost four years. The institute's subindex of employment rose to 57 in March, the highest since December 1987. The employment index indicates the proportion of manufacturers increasing payrolls, but doesn't measure the number of employees being added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norbert Ore, a purchasing executive at Georgia-Pacific Corp. and chairman of the ISM's manufacturing survey committee, said, "Even though our numbers show employment up for five months it doesn't seem to be translating in the real world to improved job growth. I see a positive atmosphere as far as jobs are concerned but I don't think anyone is in a huge hurry." Mr. Ore noted that one respondent had hired a single employee in customer service, but as far as the ISM's survey is concerned, "that's as good as 1,000" employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonfarm payrolls have grown an average of just 60,000 a month for the past five months. Economists expect Friday's report on March employment to show more than 100,000 jobs were created, but similar forecasts have proven optimistic in recent months. Still, other reports also point to an improving labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday, the Labor Department said first-time claims for unemployment benefits declined 3,000 last week to 342,000. The less volatile four-week moving average was unchanged at 340,250, the lowest level in three years. That level of claims would normally point to monthly job creation of about 200,000. But lately, declining layoffs do not seem to be associated with increased new hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing upturn is a global affair. An index made up of purchasing managers' indexes from around the world rebounded to 56.9 in March from 55.8 in February as factory activity accelerated in the U.S., Japan, the U.K. and countries that use the euro, J.P. Morgan and NTC Research, who produce the index, said yesterday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM report also showed that manufacturers are dealing with sharply higher prices for raw materials. The prices-paid index jumped to a nine-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more muted picture was painted by a Labor Department report that wholesale inflation decelerated in February after rising sharply in recent months. The producer-price index rose 0.1% in February from January, a sharp slowing from January's 0.6% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding food and energy, "core" producer prices rose just 0.1%, also a slowdown from January's 0.3%, although core inflation would have been higher without a sharp drop in light-truck prices. After a long period of deflation, wholesale inflation has returned in recent months because of the weaker dollar and surging prices for commodities such as steel, oil and natural gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve officials remain sanguine, however, because little of that increase is filtering through to consumer goods and in any case consumers spend more on services whose costs are being kept in check by declining labor costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department said construction spending fell 0.1% in February from January, after declining 0.8% in January. Residential construction fell 0.3%, a drop possibly exacerbated by bad weather. However, nonresidential private construction, such as on office buildings and factories, rose 1.1%. Public construction, such as on schools and roads, shrank 1.0%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty and Jon E. Hilsenrath </div><div>754 words</div><div>26 March 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate profits in the fourth quarter rose at the fastest pace in nearly 20 years as companies benefited from low interest rates, rising demand and an ability to raise output without adding staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said total corporate pretax profits in the latest quarter surged 29% from a year earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.21 trillion. It was the biggest quarterly increase since the first quarter of 1984, when pretax profits jumped 36%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Profit growth is extraordinary," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at research firm Decision Economics in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government also said gross domestic product, the nation's total output of goods and services, expanded at a 4.1% annual rate in the fourth quarter, unchanged from the Commerce Department's previous estimate. That was down from the third quarter's unusually strong 8.2% increase but still a healthy pace, in line with economists' expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Profits are soaring largely because automation, more-effective use of computers and other efficiency gains have allowed many companies to increase sales without hiring more people. Productivity, or hourly output per worker, jumped 4.4% in 2003 and 5% in 2002, compared with an average of just 2.3% in the past 55 years. Borrowing costs are also cheap because the Federal Reserve has been holding its target for short-term interest rates at 1%, the lowest level in nearly 46 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of 2003, total pretax corporate profits rose 18%, compared with a 17% increase in 2002. Profits declined modestly in 2001 and 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As hiring remains slow and wages flat, stock owners are grabbing a bigger piece of the economy than wage earners. Profits as a percentage of GDP in the fourth quarter reached 10.7%, the highest since 1997, noted David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. The current level is near the 11% average of the 1960s but well above the averages of 8.5% in the 1990s, 7.2% in the 1980s and 8.6% in the 1970s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists think profit growth will slow but remain strong. A panel of about 50 economists polled by Blue Chip Economic Indicators of Kansas City, Mo., shows a combined forecast of 17% profit growth this year and 10% in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the economy keeps growing, companies eventually will have to step up hiring to keep up with demand, though employment gains may not match those of past economic expansions, Mr. Sinai said. In a separate report, the Labor Department said new claims for unemployment benefits increased a modest 1,000 to 339,000 in the week ended Saturday. Economists and investors are eagerly awaiting the Labor Department's report on payroll employment in March, due to be released April 2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other measures of corporate profitability also show huge increases. Among 1,478 companies tracked by Dow Jones &amp;Co. in the US Total Market Index, net income in the fourth quarter was $148.2 billion, more than twice the $62.9 billion recorded a year earlier. Those figures exclude Time Warner Inc., whose huge write-down of its AOL unit in 2002 distorted the comparison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airlines reported total profit of $96.6 million compared with a loss of $1.5 billion the previous year. Energy companies reported profit of $11.9 billion, compared with a loss of $493 million the previous year. Financial companies saw profit nearly double to $46.4 billion from $28.1 billion. Industrial companies saw profits rise to $16.7 billion from $9.6 billion. Technology companies reported profit of $13.4 billion, compared with a loss of $4.6 billion the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its latest report on GDP, the government revised its inflation figures slightly higher. The price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, a measure favored by the Fed, increased in the fourth quarter at an annual rate of 1%, up from a preliminary estimate of 0.7%. Stripping out volatile food and energy costs, the PCE index climbed 1.2%, compared with the previous estimate of 0.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market remained strong last month. Sales of previously occupied homes rose 2% to an annual rate of 6.12 million in February, the National Association of Realtors said. The NAR said the median price of resold homes was $168,100 in February, up 5.7% from a year earlier. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total U.S. corporate profits before taxes surged 29% in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department reported.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. agency also said gross domestic product, the nation's total output of goods and services, expanded at a 4.1% annual rate in the fourth quarter, unchanged from its previous estimate. That was down from the third quarter's unusually strong 8.2% surge but still a healthy pace, in line with economists' expectations. For all of 2003, the economy grew at a 3.1% clip, up from 2.2% in 2002 and 0.5% in 2001.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of 2003, pretax corporate profits advanced 18%, compared with a 17% increase in 2002. The corporate-profit figure is adjusted to strip out gains or losses on inventories and eliminate distortion caused by accelerated depreciation for tax purposes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Profit growth has been strong largely because higher productivity has allowed companies to increase sales without hiring more people.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other measures of corporate profitability have turned sharply higher. Among 1,479 companies tracked by Dow Jones &amp; Co. in the U.S. Total Market Index, net income rose by a factor of seven in the fourth quarter of 2003 from the previous year, to $148.9 billion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures are those actually reported by listed companies under generally accepted accounting principles, without the many special adjustments that Wall Street analysts often make to the numbers. The figures also aren't recorded at an annual rate, as are the Commerce Department figures.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year-to-year jump was distorted by the $44 billion charge taken by Time Warner Inc. in 2002 to write down the value of its America Online unit. But even with Time Warner excluded, the profits reported by companies more than doubled in the fourth quarter from the year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Dow Jones compilation, airlines reported profits of $96.6 million compared with a loss of $1.5 billion the previous year. Oil companies reported profits of $11.9 billion, compared with losses of $493 million the previous year. Financial companies saw profits double to $4.8 billion from $2.2 billion the previous year. Industrial companies saw profits rise to $16.7 billion from $9.6 billion. And technology companies reported profits of $13.4 billion, compared with a loss of $4.6 billion the year before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the U.S. Labor Department said new claims for unemployment benefits increased a modest 1,000 to 339,000 in the week ended March 20. Claims for benefits have been trending down in recent weeks as layoffs have slowed. But new hiring has remained slight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists and investors are eagerly awaiting the Labor Department's report on employment growth in March, due to be released next Friday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its latest report on GDP, the government revised its inflation figures to a slightly higher level. The price index for personal spending, a measure favored by the Federal Reserve, increased at an annual rate of 1%, up from a preliminary estimate of 0.7%. Stripping out volatile food and energy costs, the index climbed 1.2%, compared with the previous estimate of 0.7%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market remained strong in March, supported by low interest rates that are allowing more people to afford monthly payments. Sales of previously occupied homes rose 2% to an annual rate of 6.12 million, the National Association of Realtors said. The NAR's chief economist, David Lereah, said that he has been projecting a slight decline from last year's record sales but that "with a strong underlying demand for housing from a growing population in a recovering economy, we could be flirting with another record this year."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, a government report said sales of new single-family homes in February increased 5.8% from January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.163 million. That was the highest level since August.  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Orders for Durable Goods Rose 2.5% in February in Surprise Gain</span>
</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty and Jeff Bater </div><div>683 words</div><div>25 March 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders in the U.S. for big-ticket manufactured goods such as cars and aircraftrebounded in February, but the overall performance was mixed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Durable-goods orders, items generally expected to last more than three years, increased 2.5% to $183.82 billion last month, the U.S. Commerce Department said. Wall Street economists had been expecting a rise of only about 1.6%. The surprisingly large gain was due to a surge in aircraft and motor-vehicle orders; excluding transportation, durable-goods orders edged down 0.3%. The department also said orders fell in January more than previously estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shipments of capital goods other than those related to defense fell 0.6% in February after slipping 0.3% in January. As a result, economists at Morgan Stanley cut their forecast for first-quarter growth in gross domestic product, the nation's total output of goods and services, to 4% from 4.6%. David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley, said there is "decent underlying momentum" in orders, even though actual shipments lagged behind expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The durable-goods numbers often lurch up and down from month to month, and some economists saw the latest data as positive overall. "The manufacturing recovery is on solid ground," said Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist at the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, an industry group based in Arlington, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For January, the Commerce Department said, overall orders declined 2.7%, compared with the previous estimate of a 2.3% drop. Orders rose 1.7% in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, transportation orders jumped 9.9%, the biggest increase since July 2002. That came after a 10.5% drop in January. Nondefense aircraft orders leapt 34% in February, while orders for defense aircraft surged 61%. Cars and parts rose 5%, after dropping 4.4% in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the department reported strong sales of new homes as lower interest rates encouraged buyers. Sales of new single-family homes in February increased 5.8% from January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.163 million, the highest level since August. The February level of sales was well above Wall Street expectations: A Dow Jones Newswires/CNBC survey of 23 economists predicted sales would fall 0.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of houses also remains tight. The inventory of homes on the market fell to a 3.8-month supply last month from a 4.1-month supply in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have been revising upward their expectations for housing sales this year because of the recent decline in mortgage interest rates and expectations they will remain low the rest of the year. The average interest charge for a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage sank last week to 5.38%, according to Freddie Mac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve's policy of keeping short-term interest rates at their lowest level in nearly 46 years worries some economists, who warn that cheap borrowing costs are fueling excessive demand for homes and some other assets. A survey of 203 economists by the National Association for Business Economics, conducted early this month, found that 28% of them believed the Fed's monetary policy is too stimulative, up from 9% who held that view a year ago. In the latest survey, 70% of the respondents said monetary policy is about right and 3% called it too restrictive.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ray A. Smith </div><div>959 words</div><div>25 March 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A CONDOMINIUM CRAZE that's stretching across the country is resulting in sharply higher prices -- and casting doubt on the long-held belief that they're a bad investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time since such numbers were tracked beginning in the 1980s, the median sales price of a condo in the U.S. exceeded that of a single-family home -- and rose at a faster pace -- in the fourth quarter of 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a condo was $174,700, up 14.9% from $152,000 in the fourth quarter of 2002, according to the National Association of Realtors. By comparison, the median price of a single-family home was $171,600.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand has been fueled by a number of factors. A growing number of empty-nesters are downsizing from houses and choosing to live in urban centers; condos are often the most affordable way to buy property in a city. Low interest rates are driving younger people to buy condominiums rather than rent apartments. And high costs for single-family housing had priced many buyers out of that market in recent years, forcing them to turn to condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditionally, single-family homes have been seen as a better long-term investment in terms of appreciation. But on a national basis, condos have actually appreciated about 33% since 2001, compared with 15% for single-family homes. In some areas, such as Los Angeles, Boston and Phoenix, demand -- and thus prices -- has particularly surged. In the Los Angeles-Long Beach market, for example, condo prices have soared 79% in the past three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, the price advantage of condos helped them generate more rapid price gains, says Celia Chen, director of housing economics, at economic-research firm Economy.com. "Evidently, the strong demand for homeownership is lifting all boats, but some are rising higher than others," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condos built in the last few years tend to command the highest prices, says Daniela Kunen, managing director at real-estate firm Douglas Elliman in New York, largely because they are typically better constructed and have touches such as mahogany finishes, high ceilings and marble bathrooms. Condos in buildings with fewer apartments per floor have also been in high demand. And townhouse condos -- which offer more privacy as well as sometimes backyards and garages -- tend to appreciate more than apartment-style condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the median price for condos surpassed that of single-family homes only for the final quarter of 2003, appreciation was faster for condos throughout the entire year. The median existing condo price rose 15.2% to $163,800 in 2003; the typical single-family resale home price rose 7.5% to $170,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong national prices may be skewed somewhat by condo-heavy markets, such as New York and Chicago, where condos tend to be more expensive. "It's not that the average condo is worth more than the average house," says Michael Schill, director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University School of Law. It's that condos may represent a larger share of housing sales in those markets, he explains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, median condo prices exceeded those of median single-family home prices in markets such as the Santa Barbara, Calif., metropolitan area and Philadelphia, but not in most of the 37 metro areas in which research company Fiserv CSW of Cambridge, Mass., tracks condo prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors reports that median condo prices rose the most in the Northeast, followed by the West, the South and the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the fast growth is not without risk for buyers who choose to invest in condos. Condo development rose in the 1970s and 1980s, leading to overbuilding followed by steep declines in value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time around, developers are already voting with their bricks: Condo construction starts increased to 86,000 units in 2003, compared with 71,000 units the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another potential problem is that condo owners, unlike homeowners, have to worry about the solvency and behavior of their neighbors, says Nicolas Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. If a few unit owners fall behind on their association fees or are careless about maintenance, the value of the whole complex could suffer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the better opportunities for potential condo buyers are in Chicago, Cleveland, Phoenix and Portland, Ore., says David Stiff, senior economist at Fiserv CSW, because those markets are stable and steady. He worries about Los Angeles, San Diego and, to a lesser extent, Boston, New York and San Francisco -- all of which he describes as overheated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economy.com's Ms. Chen expects the rapid rise in condo prices "will cool this year and will likely slip relative to house prices." With the gap closing between condo and single-family house prices, condos won't look like much of a bargain anymore. Ms. Chen also predicts rising mortgage interest rates will damp demand for homeownership, ultimately bringing prices down for homes and condos.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Today's Market Forecast]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House Party</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling mortgage rates are working their magic on the economy -- again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buoyed by falling interest rates, new-home sales jumped 5.8% in February to their highest level in six months and beat expectations of a slight decline, according to a Commerce Department report released yesterday. Existing-home sales coming out today also are expected to rise to 6.2 million on an annual basis, from 6.04 million in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home purchases give the economy a kick as people open their pocketbooks or take on debt to build their castle or to buy an existing one. New furniture or other add-on spending often follows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower interest rates make the whole process more affordable. Some argue that the ugly jobs picture and terrorism fears that cause investors to flock to bonds, instead of stocks, push down yields and therefore make the housing market more attractive. As rates go down, people are willing to buy more expensive homes because the mortgage debt gets cheaper and cheaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a double-edged sword. Rates could go back up -- and when they do, houses bought or built in the days of a 3.7% 10-year Treasury yield might look a little pricey in retrospect. Of course, all things housing are local, so some areas will likely get hit harder than others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, "we're all concerned about a bubble," in housing, says Michael Cheah, a fund manager at AIG SunAmerica Asset Management. "We all like bubbles, but we are all fearful about when it will end."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cheah says renewed strength in the housing market will help the economy because it "lifts up the wealth effect." Part of this is psychological: Homeowners feel richer as their real estate appreciates in value. The other part is real, as people get cash from refinancing their mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, though, homeowners' income often isn't growing as fast as the value of their homes. For first-time home buyers, that means more cash needs to be saved or debt taken on to purchase a first home. And for them, there is less money on the side to buy that new furniture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larry Kantor, head of market strategy at Barclays Capital, is less concerned. Rising rates might eventually cause a slight drop in some home prices, but he says rates falling so far has helped consumers from becoming overextended in debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He sees more growth for housing -- in part because rates have fallen even further since last month and because a cold winter in many regions of the U.S. could lead to a building bounce in the spring.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building in the U.S. slowed in February for the second month in a row, but home builders say demand for new housing remains strong.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Commerce Department said housing starts declined 4% from January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.86 million. Starts were up 13% from the year-earlier rate. Economists and home builders said they are optimistic that 2004 will be another strong year for housing, largely because the recent declines in interest rates have encouraged more people to buy houses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are seeing incredible strength in the housing market," said Joel Rassman, chief financial officer of Toll Brothers Inc., a home builder based in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes by Standard Pacific Corp. in the first two months of this year were up 31% from a year earlier to 1,890, said Stephen J.

</div><div class="author">A Wall Street Journal News Roundup  </div><div>669 words</div><div>17 March 2004</div><div>The Asian Wall Street Journal</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2004 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Federal Reserve, observing that the expanding U.S. economy still hasn't resuscitated the job market, decided Tuesday to hold its key interest rate at a 46-year low.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's monetary-policy committee voted unanimously to keep the key federal funds rate at 1%, where it has been for the past nine months. Policy makers said they're in no hurry to push interest rates higher despite "solid" economic growth this year. That, they said, is because jobs have remained scarce and the outlook for inflation remains benign.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Output is continuing to expand at a solid pace," the Federal Open Market Committee said in its statement. "Although job losses have slowed, new hiring has lagged. Increases in core consumer prices are muted and expected to remain low." Under the circumstances, the committee said it believes it "can be patient in removing its policy accommodation."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision was expected on Wall Street. The sluggish pace of job creation in recent months has renewed investors' fears that the economic recovery could fizzle. It has also troubled Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who said last week that job creation was "lagging badly." Accordingly, all of the 23 primary bond dealers authorized to trade securities predicted the federal funds rate would remain unchanged.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy has been out of recession for 2 1/2 years, having been propelled by an extraordinarily large combination of tax and interest-rate cuts. But that stimulus so far has produced only paltry increases in the number of jobs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sluggishness, analysts say, poses a threat not just to President George W. Bush's re-election prospects but also to the economic recovery itself. The economy grew a robust 4.3% last year and is expected to grow slightly faster this year, but some analysts say it could lose steam after June if the pace of job creation hasn't picked up to an average of 100,000 or more a month by then.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We and most others have consistently overestimated employment growth in the past few months," Jan Hatzius, an economist with Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. in New York, wrote in a note to the firm's clients last week. "We still expect the pace of non-farm payroll gains to rise above 100,000 per month by early summer. But such an upturn now appears both more urgent and more uncertain than it did a few months earlier." If those gains don't materialize, he said, economic growth in the second half of 2003 could fall below 3%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, home building in the U.S. slowed in February for the second month in a row, but a recent survey of employers signaled a possible end to stagnant U.S. job market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said housing starts declined 4% from January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.86 million. But starts were still up 13% from the year-earlier rate and considered to be holding on to strong levels. Economists and homebuilders said they are optimistic that 2004 will be another strong year for housing, largely because the recent declines in interest rates have encouraged more people to buy houses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the job market, a survey of 35,000 employers last month by Manpower Inc. indicated that 28% of U.S. companies plan to add workers in the second quarter. Since the results are just projections, however, they aren't considered as significant as the monthly payroll numbers that the government reports.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The projections suggest the economy will get more new jobs during the second quarter than it did during the first quarter when seasonal differences are removed from the data. Sixty-two percent of employers don't plan to increase or reduce their work force, and 6% plan to get rid of workers. Four percent are undecided.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building in the U.S. slowed in February for the second month in a row, but home builders say demand for new housing remains strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said housing starts declined 4% from January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.86 million. The National Association of Home Builders blamed bad weather in much of the South and West. Even so, starts were up 13% from the year-earlier rate.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the job market has been weak this year, economists believe the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low indefinitely. That is bolstering the view that houses will continue to sell briskly in much of the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing has been the beneficiary of a weak labor market," said David Lereah, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. While some people are having trouble finding jobs, he said, those who do hold jobs have been bidding up the prices of homes, especially in coastal areas where supplies of available homes are low. As of yesterday, for instance, Standard Pacific had just three houses available for sale in California, Mr. Scarborough said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug Duncan, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association, forecast earlier this week that housing starts this year will total 1.83 million, down only slightly from last year's 1.85 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the latest figure fell short of the Wall Street consensus forecast calling for a rise of about 1% in February from a month earlier. The government said starts in January declined 6.3% from December, less than the previous estimate of a 7.9% decrease. February's drop left starts at their lowest level since August, and was 10% below the exceptionally strong rate recorded in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, an indicator of future building activity, fell 1.5% in February to a 1.90 million annual rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of construction varied widely from region to region. Starts jumped 25% in the Northeast and rose 7.1% in the Midwest, but dropped 11% in the South and 7.5% in the West.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Simon and James R. Hagerty </div><div>1159 words</div><div>11 March 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF YOU THOUGHT buying a home would be easier -- and cheaper -- this year, you may be in for a rude awakening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spring home-buying season is just getting off the ground, but it already looks like home sales could set a record in 2004. Some 7.2 million homes changed hands last year, according to the National Association of Realtors. With interest rates lower than expected, Frank E. Nothaft, chief economist at mortgage-financing company Freddie Mac, yesterday predicted home sales will reach a record 7.3 million this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices, too, are surging. Fiserv CSW, a research company, says home prices are expected to climb 7.4% this year, following a 7.5% rise in 2003. But gains could be far greater in the hottest markets, as buyers compete for a dwindling supply of homes. In Los Angeles, for example, prices are expected to climb some 15%. In such markets, the tight supply is leading to another round of multiple offers and bidding wars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This isn't what many economists were predicting just a few months ago. "Myself and all the experts thought this would be a slower year," says Kenneth Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California at Berkeley. But with mortgage rates remaining below 6% far longer than expected, many real-estate offices are buzzing and some economists are revising their forecasts upward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And mortgage rates could go even lower. Yesterday, 10-year Treasurys -- a key benchmark for mortgage rates -- closed at just 3.72%. With sluggish job growth, there's little concern that inflation will rise anytime soon. That, in turn, should keep mortgage rates low. The average rate for a 30-year conforming fixed-rate mortgage fell yesterday to 5.40%, the lowest levels since early July, according to HSH Associates, financial publishers in Pompton Plains, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some markets are at a near frenzy. Virginia's Fairfax County and California's Orange County report particularly strong demand for starter and midprice homes. The number of listings in Orange County was down 65% in January over a year earlier. "There's about a week's supply of homes on the market," says Leslie Appleton-Young, chief economist of the California Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation isn't much different in other parts of the state. Overall, California has just a two-month supply of homes. That's well below the seven months of supply that has been the average in California for the past 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Centreville, Va., outside Washington, D.C., a three-bedroom townhouse that went on the market in February, priced at $285,000, drew 30 offers and sold four days later for about $320,000. A fixer-upper in Ridgefield, Conn., priced at $734,900, recently attracted seven offers the day after it came on the market, according to Nancy Ollinger of Neumann Real Estate. In Las Vegas, a four-bedroom house listed in January for $216,000 received 43 bids and sold for $265,000, says Lee Barrett, president of the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors. Such fevered bidding has shown up in many parts of the country over the past few years, but until recently seemed to be subsiding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soaring prices aren't universal. Growth in home prices is expected to be below 5% in markets such as Atlanta, Cincinnati and Nashville, Tenn., according to Fiserv CSW, in part because of relatively high rates of new home construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the hot markets, the competition for choice properties is so stiff that some real-estate agents are advising would-be buyers to write letters to sellers explaining why their offer should be accepted. Other brokers are counseling buyers not to make the purchase contingent on an appraisal or inspection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kassy Kaiser, an agent with Re/Max Heritage Homes in San Diego, credits a personal letter that called the house "a forever home" and praised the home's "meticulous care" with helping her client win out over another bidder in a contest for a $529,000 home last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rachel Chavez, an insurance adjuster in Orange County, recently saw a four-bedroom home she coveted. By nine that evening, her broker, Chris Fry of Oaktree Realtors, was at the seller's door with an offer for $505,000. "As we were walking through, [the seller] was touching up the paint," recalls Ms. Chavez.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other bidders are including escalation clauses, agreeing to top other offers to a set limit. Or they're offering to let the seller stay in the house rent-free for a month or so after closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, some Realtors are advising buyers to consider skipping inspection altogether. "If they're asking for one, they probably won't get [the house]," says Vicki Nellis, an agent for Re/Max Allegiance in the Washington suburb of Burke, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors are working hard to drum up new listings by targeting homeowners who have been in their home for a long period or who might otherwise be interested in moving. Ron Phipps, a Realtor in Warwick, R.I., recently began sending out thick marketing packages to local homeowners, a move that doubled his inventory. "If you wait for listings to hit the multiple-listing service or the marketplace, or for a sign to go up, it's most likely they are going to be gone," says Maurice Veissi, president of Veissi &amp;Associates in Miami.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prolonged drop in interest rates has been a mixed blessing for home buyers. Lower mortgage rates make homes more affordable. But low rates have also pushed housing prices up so much that homeowners in some markets can't afford to trade up, which means fewer lower-price homes are coming on the market. Also, many people have pulled cash out and remodeled, another reason there's a thin supply of homes on the market. Refinancing began slowing last year as rates climbed, but now it's kicking back up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When mortgage rates finally do move upward -- as they almost surely will when employment rebounds -- selling a home will get tougher. If rates rise sharply and stay up, home prices could actually fall in some markets. "The risk is rising," says Mr. Rosen of the University of California at Berkeley. "The higher prices go earlier, the more likely we are going to have a correction in 2005 and 2006."</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty and Jon E. Hilsenrath  </div><div>1499 words</div><div>3 March 2004</div><div>The Asian Wall Street Journal</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2004 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After more than three years of declines in factory jobs, U.S. manufacturers say they are finally starting to hire again as orders rebound, exports perk up and inventories shrink.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists caution that the apparent turnaround, indicated in a bellwether survey of manufacturing managers, is in its early stages. They note that gains -- if they continue to spread -- would offset at best only a small portion of the three million manufacturing jobs lost since August 2000, at least in the near term. On Friday, the government will issue data on employment levels for February. That overall report, which showed disappointingly small job creation in December and January, might not reflect improvements suggested by Monday's survey, economists say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even a small reversal in hiring could help the Bush administration make a case that the recovery is finally benefiting ordinary Americans, not just corporate profits. The net loss of 2.4 million jobs under President George W. Bush, many of them outsourced to less-expensive overseas locations, has become a major issue in the election, with Democratic candidates, labor unions and other groups attacking the administration's economic record.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ohio, especially, one of 10 states that voted Tuesday in Democratic primaries, Democrats have seized on job losses. John Kerry, the Democratic front-runner, appeared in Toledo last week to propose new federal requirements that would force American companies to disclose publicly what jobs are moved overseas -- and to give workers three months' notice that their jobs are in jeopardy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new sign of tentative recovery in manufacturing came in a report Monday from the Institute for Supply Management, an association of supply managers that surveys purchasing agents at more than 400 industrial companies each month. The ISM's index of manufacturing activity registered 61.4 in February. Though down from 63.6 in January, it was the fourth consecutive month that the index has been above 60, and that is the best four-month performance in two decades. Readings above 50 indicate a generally expanding manufacturing economy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Businesses are back," said Norbert J. Ore, who heads the committee that conducts the ISM survey. "They're more willing to invest, and spending is improving."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, businesses are again buying machinery and equipment after long postponing such capital investment during the downturn. Another factor in the improvement is that the decline of the dollar is spurring exports by making U.S. goods less expensive in foreign markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is still reason for caution, given that manufacturing jobs have continued to decline in recent months despite the index's strong showing, though job losses have slowed. Prices of many raw materials, moreover, are rising, threatening a long-term recovery.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Manufacturers, the Washington-based manufacturers' trade association, expects a modest turnaround by year end, and is projecting an increase of 250,000 manufacturing jobs to a total of 14.6 million. Manufacturing accounts for about 11% of total U.S. nonfarm payroll employment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Kretzmer, senior economist at Bank of America, said the ISM's report makes him "less nervous" about standing by his forecast that employment levels finally will begin to rise more rapidly within the next few months. He projects that payroll employment will rise an average of 125,000 to 150,000 a month this year, compared with an average monthly decline of 4,000 in 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purchasing agents surveyed were particularly bullish on employment at manufacturers. The ISM's employment index stood at 56.3 in February, up from 52.9 in January. The February number was the highest since December 1987. The index is calculated by comparing the number of agents who describe conditions as improving with those who say they are the same or getting worse.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more hopeful trend is apparent at Innovative Machining Inc., a Wheat Ridge, Colorado, maker of parts for the medical equipment, aerospace and other industries. The closely held company is likely to double its factory work force to 50 by year end, said John Bryan, president. Many of those jobs, though, will be entry-level ones paying $6.50 to $7 an hour, he said. "I'm going to take kids out of Wendy's and McDonald's and teach them to be a machinist," he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders at Bison Gear &amp; Engineering Corp., a closely held St. Charles, Illinois, maker of electric motors used in industrial equipment, have been growing for the past six months, said Ron Bullock, chairman and chief executive officer. He said the weaker dollar is helping the company export more and that many customers have begun seeking accelerated deliveries as demand improves.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bison Gear's work force has expanded about 10% in the past year to 200 and the company still has a few openings to fill, Mr. Bullock said. But the company doesn't need to hire as many people as it did in past recoveries because it has become more efficient in terms of its factory-floor organization and flow of materials.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Productivity gains and competition from China also are tempering job growth at Technical Materials Inc., a Lincoln, Rhode Island, maker of coils of metal used in computers, medical equipment and other industries. The work force has expanded about 5% in the past four months to 215 but is still down from nearly 350 four years ago, said Al Lubrano, president of the company, a unit of Brush Engineered Materials. The decline reflects work lost to rivals in China. Mr. Lubrano said the company eventually will have to shift some of its production to China to stay close to customers that have moved there.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with stronger orders, many manufacturers are seeing rising material costs, particularly for steel and some other metals. The ISM's index for price increases stood at 81.5 in February, the highest level in nine years. If steel prices keep surging, said Mr. Bryan at Innovative Materials, "It's going to kill this recovery."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the ISM's manufacturing index remains strong, other indicators of manufacturing-sector activity paint a more sobering picture. Manufacturing output, as measured by the Federal Reserve, has been subdued, rising a modest 0.1% in December and 0.3% in January.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent report on plant shutdowns by Alliance Capital Management LP might cast some new light on these trends. According to Joseph Carson, director of economic research at Alliance, 21,513 U.S. factories were shut down in 2002 and 2003, up sharply from 13,824 shutdowns during the previous four-year period. Mr. Carson said it is possible these shutdowns weren't fully reflected in the ISM index in earlier months, since the survey is based on responses by purchasing managers at active plants rather than those at plants that have been closed. When a plant closes, the institute replaces it with another survey participant.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, with this wave of shutdowns in the manufacturing sector now largely passed, Mr. Carson said he believed that the index as presently constituted is pointing to a real recovery in the manufacturing sector. "We should see job growth within the manufacturing sector pretty soon," Mr. Carson said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ore, chairman of the institute's survey committee, noted that there was a slightly higher level of "churn" in survey participants late last year as new participants were brought in to replace exiting participants. He said he didn't believe this has affected survey results, however.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ore said he had noticed an increased number of survey participants remarking in recent months that demand for their products had risen more than expected, forcing them to increase production and employment. He said the breadth of the number of industries reporting a recovery was especially remarkable in February. All 20 industries reported improvement in economic conditions, including several basic materials industries that have lagged behind in the recovery, such as chemicals, paper, glass, printing and publishing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, reports from the Commerce Department showed fairly strong consumer spending and wage growth for employees. Personal income edged up 0.2% in January. That was the smallest increase since August, largely because of declines in farm, interest and rental income. But wages of employees on company payrolls increased a solid 0.5%, partly because of a longer average workweek. Personal tax payments dropped 4.9%, helped by bigger refunds, leaving more money in consumers' pockets. As a result, disposable income was up 0.8% from December.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But consumers didn't blow all of that extra cash. Consumer spending rose 0.4% in January. The savings rate climbed to 1.8% in January from 1.4% in December.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending dropped 0.3% in January. That was the first decline since May and partly reflected harsh weather.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. factory production remained strong in February, according to a private research group, amid signs that lower federal income taxes are encouraging consumers to keep spending.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management said its index of U.S. manufacturing activity registered 61.4 in February. Though down from 63.6 in January, that was still considered a strong showing because readings above the 50-point level indicate continued expansion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It appears that the manufacturing sector has sustainable momentum at this point," said Norbert J. Ore, director of procurement at Georgia-Pacific Corp. and head of the ISM survey, which gathers data from purchasing agents at more than 400 industrial companies. "This month, many respondents are particularly encouraged by the increased breadth of the recovery in manufacturing."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purchasing agents surveyed were particularly bullish on employment at manufacturers. The ISM's employment index stood at 56.3 in February, up from 52.9 in January. The February number was the highest since December 1987. The latest reading "shows that employment prospects in manufacturing appear to be improving rapidly," economists at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. said in a report. That should encourage economists and investors as they await Friday's U.S. government report on employment in the economy as a whole, which has been feeble during recent months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, reports from the U.S. Commerce Department showed fairly strong consumer spending and wage growth for employees.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal income edged up 0.2% during January, the smallest increase since August and well below expectations. A Dow Jones Newswires/CNBC survey of 13 economists before the data were released showed an average projection of 0.6%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That weakness partly reflected declines in farm, interest and rental income. By contrast, wages of employees on company payrolls increased a solid 0.5%, partly because of a longer average workweek. Personal-tax payments dropped 4.9%, helped by bigger refunds, leaving more money in consumers' pockets. As a result, disposable income rose 0.8% from December and 5.2% from a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But consumers didn't blow all of that extra cash. Consumer spending rose 0.4% in January, in line with expectations. The savings rate climbed to 1.8% in January from 1.4% in December.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. construction spending dropped 0.3% in January, the Commerce Department said. It was the first decline since May. Spending fell in office construction and was flat for homes.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Greg Ip </div><div>890 words</div><div>26 February 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan sided with President Bush by strongly opposing any tax increases to contain the spiraling budget deficit, instead proposing that the government scale back Social Security and Medicare benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greenspan struck a sensitive election-year nerve and drew swift criticism from Democratic presidential candidates. Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina said it was "an outrage" for Mr. Greenspan to suggest making tax cuts permanent on "unearned wealth while cutting Social Security benefits that working people earn." Front-runner Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts said the way to address the deficit was to roll back tax cuts for the wealthy and "the wrong way to cut the deficit is to cut Social Security benefits. If I'm president, we're simply not going to do it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bush distanced himself from Mr. Greenspan's comments, telling reporters he doesn't want to cut Social Security benefits for those near retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greenspan told the House Budget Committee that raising taxes by enough to solve the deficit would "pose significant risks to economic growth and the revenue base." Those risks, he said, "warrant aiming to close the fiscal gap primarily, if not wholly," though spending cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, he repeated his longstanding view that Social Security benefits should be pegged to a price index that measures inflation differently from the consumer-price index now used. He prefers the "chained" consumer-price index, which better reflects how consumers spend less on items that become costlier. Since 2001, inflation has averaged 2.1% according to the regular CPI, but 1.8% according to the chained CPI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also repeated his view that retirement ages for both Social Security and Medicare, slated to rise to 67, should be linked to increases in life expectancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In broader comments on the economy, Mr. Greenspan said the risk of deflation has faded considerably; gave a preferred range for the Fed's goal of price stability that underlined his scant tolerance for any rise in inflation; and noted that high growth in productivity and unused economic slack should "keep a lid on inflation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was his comments on the budget that drew the most attention, though. Mr. Greenspan has long said the budget should be balanced by cutting spending rather than raising taxes. But he was more emphatic yesterday, implicitly repudiating Democrats' calls to roll back the bulk of Mr. Bush's tax cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greenspan said that over time tax revenues are determined by economic and productivity growth. "If there are significant increases in taxation, risks are there to the long-term economic outlook, and therefore, the revenue base itself." Mr. Greenspan repeated his support for extending all Mr. Bush's tax cuts, which expire over the next decade, but only if paid for with spending cuts elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greenspan and most independent analysts agree that even if taxes hadn't been cut in 2001 and 2003, they would have to rise drastically to pay for the surge in Social Security and Medicare benefits to retiring baby boomers. Neither Mr. Bush nor his Democratic rivals have specified how they would deal with that looming crunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greenspan said in response to a question that the probability of deflation, or generally declining prices, "which was a year ago very low, is now much lower," though not zero, citing the behavior of goods prices. Owing in part to the declining dollar, which pushes up the price of imports, and rising commodity prices, consumer-goods prices excluding food and energy were unchanged in January after 16 consecutive monthly declines. That suggests the Fed may soon declare that inflation risks are balanced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greenspan also for the first time put numbers on his definition of price stability, the Fed's ultimate goal, saying it "probably" means inflation of between 0.5% and "a little under" 1%, although he didn't specify according to which price index. "In that regard, I think we are at price stability," he said. Inflation excluding food and energy is now between 0.8% and 1.1%, depending on the index. That suggests Mr. Greenspan may be more inclined to raise rates to prevent any increase in inflation than some of his colleagues, who have suggested a preferred range of 1% to 2%. Mr. Greenspan, however, said he and his colleagues "all agree where we want to be." Though some officials want to publish an inflation target, Mr. Greenspan said such a target wouldn't change how the Fed operated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, existing-home sales fell 5.2% in January to a 6.04 million annual rate from December, the National Association of Realtors said, though that remained a strong pace. The inventory of homes on the market rose to 4.4 months from 4.3 months, while the median home price rose 5.4% to $168,700 in January from January 2003.</p>

</div><div class="author">A Wall Street Journal News Roundup  </div><div>887 words</div><div>26 February 2004</div><div>The Asian Wall Street Journal</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2004 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan urged the U.S. Congress to reverse escalating budget deficits by cutting government spending and paring benefits for future Social Security retirees, rather than by raising taxes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In testimony before the House of Representatives Budget Committee, Mr. Greenspan said the deficit situation, with a projected record red ink of $521 billion this year, will worsen significantly once the baby-boom generation begins to become eligible for Social Security benefits in four years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the time being, the Fed chairman said the U.S. economy continues to promise robust growth. "The most recent indicators suggest that the economy is off to a strong start in 2004, and prospects for sustaining the expansion in the period ahead are good," he said. Helping fuel growth has been what he called a "highly accommodative" monetary policy with real interest rates close to zero. An improving debt situation in U.S. households and business, coupled with a continued expansionary fiscal policy, also should contribute to expansion in demand.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, he said increasing productivity and a "significant" level of unused production capacity have kept a lid on inflation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks rebounded as Mr. Greenspan's comments on the economy placated Wall Street and housing data showed a strong market despite a slight pullback in sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 44 points to 10611 by late morning, while the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 13.90 to 2019.30. The S&amp;P 500-stock index rose 5 points to 1144.10. The dollar was stronger.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Greenspan warned lawmakers that the rosy short-term outlook is clouded by the growing budget deficit. He focused on the prospect of the retirement of 77 million baby boomers, beginning in 2008, which will impose new strains on federal health-care programs and worsen the ratio between people working and paying into the Social Security retirement fund and those drawing benefits from the fund. While every retiree is projected to be supported by three workers in 2011, that number will slip to 21/4 workers by 2525, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This dramatic demographic change is certain to place enormous demands on our nation's resources -- demands we will almost surely be unable to meet unless action is taken," Mr. Greenspan said. "For a variety of reasons, that action is better taken as soon as possible."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the benefits received by retirees now shouldn't be touched, but he suggested trimming benefits for future retirees and doing it soon enough that they could begin making adjustments to their own finances to prepare for retirement.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greenspan suggested two ways to trim benefits. The annual cost-of-living adjustments for those receiving benefits could be made using a new version of the consumer price index called the chain-weighted index, which gives lower readings on inflation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The age for retirement should be indexed to take into account longer lifespans, he said. He said the age for being able to get full Social Security benefits is rising from 65 to 67 as one of the changes Congress adopted in the mid-1980s, based on recommendations of a commission Mr. Greenspan headed. Mr. Greenspan said Congress should go further and index the retirement age so that it will keep rising.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He indicated that lawmakers have the opportunity to start tackling the issue because the U.S. economy is healthy. While not ruling out the use of tax increases to deal with at least part of the looming surge in spending on Social Security and other entitlement programs, Mr. Greenspan urged caution in increasing taxes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, Fed governor Edward Gramlich said the U.S. trade deficits might destabilize the U.S. economy. Also, U.S. budget deficits may not be very harmful in the short run, but in the long run, the gaps "could become much more worrisome," he said in prepared remarks at the Euromoney Bond Investors Congress in London.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large trade deficits could trigger "equilibrating, and possibly dislocating, changes in prices, interest rates, and exchange rates," Mr. Gramlich said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. current-account deficit, the broadest gauge of the nation's global trade, is projected to exceed $500 billion in 2003, reaching a record 5% of gross domestic product.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gramlich warned against trade protectionism as a solution, saying such measures probably won't help correct trade imbalances. "Even if protectionist measures reduce imports, the added spending demand for import-competing industries will crowd out other types of production," Mr. Gramlich said. "Moreover, as is well known, trade protection lowers a nation's standard of living," he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other economic news, sales of existing homes in the U.S. decreased in January, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. Home resales fell to a 6.04 million annual rate last month, a 5.2% decline. The results were weaker than economists had predicted.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have to keep in mind that the level of home-sales activity over the last six months has been the strongest on record," said David Lereah, NAR's chief economist. "The January pace was the sixth highest ever and is above the total forecast for this year."  </p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>511 words</div><div>19 February 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D9</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners of million-dollar homes no longer qualify for bragging rights in some American cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report from the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University says owner-occupied, single-family homes costing $1 million or more have become downright common in some cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing Census data, the report finds that such homes account for 11.6% of the total in Cambridge, Mass., 7% in San Francisco, 3.8% in Los Angeles, 3.3% in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and 2.7% in Stamford, Conn. Cambridge's figure is high partly because the city has a dearth of single-family homes, the report says. (Although the New York City borough of Manhattan has many million-dollar housing units, most are apartments, not single-family homes, and were therefore excluded from some of the data.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total number of million-dollar homes is unclear. The 2000 Census found about 314,000 owner-occupied, single-family homes valued at $1 million or more, while 2001 survey data from the Federal Reserve showed that 850,000 households own primary residences in that range, up from 300,000 in 1989. The true figure probably lies between the Census and Federal Reserve estimates, the report says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rising number of high-cost homes reflects rapid price appreciation for older properties in prime neighborhoods, as well as the increasing size and quality of new houses. Even at the lower end of the market, price increases have been steep in much of the country. The median single-family home sale price recorded last year by the National Association of Realtors was about $170,000, up from $148,000 in 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California accounts for 41% of the million-dollar homes identified by the Census, followed by New York at 7.1%, Florida at 5.8%, Connecticut at 4.4%, Illinois at 4%, New Jersey at 3.8%, and Texas and Massachusetts, both at 3.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While low-income people in much of the country are struggling to afford down payments on ordinary homes, lots of wealthy buyers can easily afford million-dollar houses, the report says. It cites a survey of 200 sales associates at the Coldwell Banker real-estate chain, who reported that 31% of people who spent more than $1 million for homes plunked down the entire sum in cash. Many of those people planned to plow more money into renovations.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Housing starts fell for the first time in five months, declining 7.9% last month from December as cold weather apparently cooled the housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said starts fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.9 million units, after climbing a downwardly revised 0.6% to a 2.1 million annual rate in December -- then the high point of nearly 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Weather was probably responsible for a good part of January's slippage," said Steve Stanley, an economist at RBS Greenwich Capital. Starts in the Northeast and Midwest fell 14% and 21%, respectively, but declined 5% in the South and 1% in the West, regions less susceptible to the cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing demand is likely to remain firm, though it may not grow much, if at all, from current buoyant levels. The National Association of Home Builders said its index of home-builder sentiment regarding sales of new, single-family homes slid to 65 points in February from a revised 69 in January. That still suggests a lot of optimism. When the index is over 50, it means the number of builders who see "good" sales outnumber those who see "poor" sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic concerns flared anew at the White House yesterday over a rosy prediction by President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers that the number of jobs created this year would grow by 2.6 million over the level posted in 2003. The outlook assumes far greater job growth than is so far evident. Scott McClellan, Mr. Bush's press secretary, played down the prediction, contending it was based on "forecasts made by economists at a specific point in time based on the data at that point."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, more than half of major U.S. companies shifted some jobs abroad last year, according to a new survey by the Business Council. The association of more than 100 chief executive officers said 54% of its members said their companies had shifted domestic employment abroad over the past year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Housing starts in the U.S. dropped for the first time in five months, declining 7.9% last month from December as cold weather apparently cooled the housing boom.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners of million-dollar homes no longer qualify for bragging rights in some American cities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report from the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University says that owner-occupied, single-family homes costing $1 million (779,000 euros) or more have become downright common in some U.S. cities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing U.S. Census data, the report finds that such homes account for 11.6% of the total in Cambridge, Massachusetts, 7% in San Francisco, 3.8% in Los Angeles, 3.3% in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and 2.7% in Stamford, Connecticut. Cambridge's figure is high partly because the city has a dearth of single-family homes, the report says. (Although the New York City borough of Manhattan has many million-dollar housing units, most are apartments, not single-family homes, and were therefore excluded from some of the data.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total number of million-dollar homes in the U.S. is unclear. The 2000 Census found about 314,000 owner-occupied, single-family homes valued at $1 million or more, while 2001 survey data from the U.S. Federal Reserve showed that 850,000 households own primary residences in that range, up from 300,000 in 1989. The true figure probably lies between the Census and Federal Reserve estimates, the report says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rising number of high-cost homes in the U.S. reflects rapid price appreciation for older properties in prime neighborhoods, as well as the increasing size and quality of new houses. Even at the lower end of the market, price increases have been steep. The median single-family home sale price recorded last year by the National Association of Realtors was about $170,000, up from $148,000 in 2001.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Factory activity in the U.S. rose in January for an eighth straight month, amid the biggest rise in prices since March 2000, according to the Institute for Supply Management.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other monthly reports for December, personal incomes edged up 0.2%; inflation, by the Federal Reserve's preferred measure, fell to a low of 0.7%; and construction spending rose 0.4%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM reported that its index of manufacturing activity rose to 63.6 in January from 63.4 in December, which had been revised downward. Readings above 50 indicate expansion in activity, while those below point to contraction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute said the January report was powered by broad-based vigor in the factory sector. "The manufacturing sector gained momentum in January as the PMI [purchasing managers index] continued to accelerate," ISM survey director Norbert Ore said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest movers in the index was the price component, which sharply rose to 75.5 in January from 66 in December, the biggest gain in nearly four years. The sharp increase occurred as "the metals and energy categories showed significant price volatility," Mr. Ore said. The new-orders index edged down to a still-high 71.1 from 73.1, and the production index edged up to 71.1 from 69.2. The employment index fell to 52.9 in January compared with 53.5 in December, but still pointed to a third straight monthly gain in factory employment after 37 months of contraction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM report is based on data compiled from monthly replies to questions asked of purchasing and supply executives at more than 400 industrial companies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, personal income rose by 0.2% in December, after climbing 0.3% in November, the Commerce Department said. Personal consumption increased by 0.4% after rising 0.5% in November. After subtracting a 0.2% increase in prices, inflation-adjusted personal consumption rose 0.2%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in prices kept the year-to-year change in the price index of personal consumption at 1.3%. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, the annual increase in the index dropped to 0.7% -- the lowest since the collection of data began in 1960 -- from 0.9% in November. The Fed said this index is a superior measure of inflation compared with the better-known consumer-price index.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Jim Carlton </div><div>680 words</div><div>3 February 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect 2004 to bring yet another year of feverish homebuilding. But providers of basic homebuilding materials have been able to raise prices only slightly, if at all, helping to keep homes affordable but leaving them on the wayside of one of the greatest housing booms in U.S. history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the most part, the makers of building materials have no one to blame but themselves. A burst of additional manufacturing capacity added in the late 1990s to take advantage of escalating demand and rising prices added more production than the industry required.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their lack of pricing pressure also reflects consolidation in recent years among big homebuilders, which negotiate better prices for themselves based on sheer size. Homebuilders also have proven adept at finding alternative products when prices rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"None of us are getting rich, let me tell you," says Alan Thielemann, vice president of marketing for building products at Georgia-Pacific Corp., the Atlanta-based forest-products giant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wallboard manufacturers, for example, haven't been able to increase their prices beyond the rate of inflation. Prices on insulation products remain similarly mired, as do prices for roofing, carpeting and other major ingredients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for granite have dropped, thanks to competition and increased imports from China. As a result, prices have dropped to the extent that Pacific Properties, a big builder in Las Vegas, reports that its materials cost for outfitting a two-bedroom condominium with granite has dropped by more than one half to about $1,000 from $2,500 five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only lumber and engineered-wood products have spiked in price. But those run-ups have taken place during the past year as the housing boom was well underway, and they have subsided considerably from their peaks. Those price jumps were attributable, in part, to fires that crimped logging in some parts of North America as well as to a surge in demand for more wood after Hurricane Isabel slammed into the East Coast last September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homebuilders say stable building-products prices have helped offset the run-up in land prices and permit fees in many markets. While median new-home prices have grown 17% since 2000, they might have been higher otherwise, they say. "Generally, it's been a good time to be a home builder," said Daniel Fulton, president and chief executive officer of the Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Co., a homebuilding unit of Weyerhaeuser Co., based in Federal Way, Wash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders didn't always have it so good. When homebuilding went on a tear in the late 1990s, supplies became so tight for many materials that contractors were hit with some hefty price increases. Wallboard prices, for example, more than doubled in 1999 as manufacturers were caught unprepared for the onslaught in demand. Insulation prices soared, too, as demand increased faster than manufacturers' ability to keep pace with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But manufacturers quickly added capacity. Georgia-Pacific, for example, ramped up its capacity for making gypsum board, which is used for drywall in homes, to 6.8 billion square feet by the end of 1999 from 6.1 billion in 1998, a jump of 11%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then homebuilding cooled at the end of the decade, sending prices lower for drywall and insulation. The recovery since then has been slow. "It's been a supply and demand issue, pure and simple," said Scott DeShetler, a marketing director for insulation-maker Johns Manville, a Denver-based unit of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A general consolidation of the housing industry into one made up of fewer, large builders has given contractors more bargaining power. Officials at both Dallas-based Centex Corp. and Los Angeles-based KB Home, for instance, say they can lock in discounted prices on many materials for months at a time. Said Jeff Mezger, chief operating officer of KB Home, of the company's suppliers, "We're large enough. We get their attention now." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on public construction grew 0.6% during December to a rate of $220.8 billion, the Commerce Department said.

</div><div class="author">A Wall Street Journal News Roundup  </div><div>565 words</div><div>3 February 2004</div><div>The Asian Wall Street Journal</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2004 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. factory activity rose during January for an eighth straight month, amid the biggest expansion in prices since March 2000, the Institute for Supply Management said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, personal incomes edged up 0.2% during December from November and the inflation rate by the U.S. Federal Reserve's preferred measure fell to a record low of 0.7%. Meanwhile, construction spending rose 0.4%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM reported that its index of manufacturing activity rose to 63.6 from the downwardly revised 63.4 during December. Readings above 50 point to expansion in activity, while those below indicate contraction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM said that the January report was powered by broad-based vigor in the factory sector. "The manufacturing sector gained momentum in January as the PMI [purchasing managers index] continued to accelerate," ISM survey director Norbert J. Ore said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest movers in the index was the price component, which sharply accelerated its pace of advance during January. The ISM said its prices index was up at 75.5, compared with 66 during December, marking the biggest gain in nearly four years. Mr. Ore said the "significant" acceleration in the index occurred as "the metals and energy categories showed significant price volatility." The new-orders index edged down to a still-high 71.1 from 73.1, and the production index edged up to 71.1 from 69.2. The employment index dropped to 52.9 during January from 53.5 during December, but still pointed to a third straight monthly gain in factory employment, after 37 months of contraction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM report is based on data compiled from monthly replies to questions asked of purchasing and supply executives at more than 400 industrial companies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, December's gain in personal income followed a 0.3% rise during November, the Commerce Department said. Personal consumption increased by 0.4% during December, after rising 0.5% during November. After subtracting a 0.2% increase in prices, inflation-adjusted personal consumption rose 0.2%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Personal incomes are growing at a healthy enough pace to sustain good growth in consumption," said Mickey Levy, a Banc of America Securities economist.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in prices kept the annual change in the price index of personal consumption at 1.3%. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, the annual increase in the index fell to 0.7%, the lowest since the collection of data began during 1960, from 0.9% during November. The Fed said this index is a superior measure of inflation to the better-known consumer price index.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department said construction spending rose to a seasonally adjusted $933.2 billion during December from November. Construction spending during November was revised sharply downward to a 0.5% rise from 1.2%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential private construction rose 0.9% to $502.2 billion, while nonresidential private construction, which includes office buildings, factories and health-care facilities, fell at a 1.1% annual rate to $210.2 billion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on public construction grew 0.6% during December to $220.8 billion, the Commerce Department said. The category includes roads, sewer systems and schools. Federal government outlays fell 1.8%, while state and local spending edged up 0.8%.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Jon E. Hilsenrath   </div><div>601 words</div><div>29 January 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report that took some gloss off the outlook for a manufacturing rebound, the U.S. Commerce Department said new orders for big-ticket items such as cars and computers were flat in December from the month before, after falling 2.3% in November. Reported declines in communication-equipment orders were especially pronounced for the second straight month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the decline in durable-goods orders contradicted a raft of other recent data showing a manufacturing and technology rebound, not to mention relatively optimistic assessments from tech executives during recent earnings announcements. As a result, economists were reluctant to overemphasize the latest swing in orders.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You'd have to be insane to change your mind about the big picture, in either direction, based on two months of durable-goods orders figures," said Ian Shepherdson, a bullish economist with High Frequency Economics, an economic-research company in Valhalla, New York. Underscoring his point, the government report said that actual shipments of durable goods rose in November and December, even as orders were falling.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two months of disappointing durable-goods orders figures marked a pause in what was otherwise an impressive run in order growth during 2003. Between April and October of last year, monthly orders rose 10%, to $185 billion (146.5 billion euros) from $168 billion on a seasonally adjusted basis. But by December, they had slipped back to $181 billion.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reported turnaround in tech equipment was especially sharp. The Commerce Department said orders for communications equipment fell 18% during December from November, after declining 46% the month before. Overall computer and electronic equipment orders slipped 2.7% after rising 21% between April and October.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That turnaround came as a surprise to many because tech executives have been generally upbeat in their assessments of the outlook during recent weeks. International Business Machines Corp. reported last week that fourth-quarter revenue from big computers was up 18%, led by mainframes, and personal computers rose 16%, led by laptops. In the communications sector, Verizon Communications Inc., New York, recently announced that it planned to spend $3 billion during the next two years to upgrade its networks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a quarter that just kept getting stronger," Michael Marks, chief executive of contract manufacturer Flextronics International Ltd., told investors in a conference call earlier this week.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is possible that the weakness in the durable-goods orders report is related to the movement of production by U.S. companies overseas. The Commerce Department surveys companies about their order books just for U.S. operations. It is also possible that the latest decline was a statistical quirk. Before seasonal adjustments were applied, new orders in December were up by more than $10 billion, and orders for computers and other tech equipment were up nearly $7 billion.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homes fell 5.1% during December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.06 million units, defying analysts' expectations for an increase. But the level of sales during the previous two months was revised higher, moderating the extent of the downward drift in sales. At current rates, homebuilders had on average 4.3 months of supply of homes, up from a low of 3.5 months during August. The National Association of Realtors said on Monday that existing-home sales rose 6.9% in December to an annual rate of 6.47 million units.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>1499 words</div><div>27 January 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp;Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE MEDIAN house price in State College, Pa., in 2003 was $164,500, up 23% from three years earlier, according to the local Realtors association. In a table accompanying a Personal Journal article Jan. 27 about rising home prices, the figure was incorrectly stated as $218,360, up 54.8%, because of an inaccurate estimate provided by Fidelity National Financial Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ Feb. 20, 2004)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END) </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE LATEST BULLETINS from Realtors and home builders sound reassuring: The house party will rage on in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheaper mortgages have helped get the housing market off to a fast start this year. Most forecasts suggest prices will rise substantially again in 2004, albeit at a slightly slower pace than in the past few years. The National Association of Realtors reported yesterday that sales of existing homes in December rose a stronger-than-expected 6.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.47 million units. The national median home price in December was $173,200, up 6.7% from a year earlier. For the full year, sales hit a record 6.1 million homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the local market can be much different from the national average, and risks remain for people who have bought recently or are thinking of buying in some West Coast and East Coast markets. Price increases have been particularly dizzying there in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a paper to be published soon in the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, house-price gurus Karl E. Case of Wellesley College and Robert J. Shiller of Yale University find that the national measures of market trends can be very misleading. In most of the country, house prices tend to rise gradually, in line with personal income, they find. But California, New Jersey, New York, New England and Hawaii -- all of them short on land for building new homes -- are prone to lurch from booms to busts or periods of stagnation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upshot: Buying a house in a popular, land-starved place doesn't necessarily mean you will gain more in percentage terms over the long term. In the 21 years ended in the first quarter of last year, Messrs. Case and Shiller found, prices in Milwaukee more than tripled, about the same as in Los Angeles. The difference was that prices in Milwaukee rose steadily, while Los Angeles rode a roller coaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now much of California is on another wild ride. Median single-family home prices in the San Diego area have surged 60% over the past three years, according to Fidelity National Financial Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vanessa Bachman, a paralegal, calls that number "terrifying." Even so, she and her husband, Richard, a radio-station promotions director, have just agreed to buy their first home, a $200,000 condominium, in the San Diego suburbs. "We kept waiting for [prices] to go down," Ms. Bachman says. "We finally decided to go for it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditionally, falling prices have been the exception. The more common pattern is that a period of frenzied price rises in a city or neighborhood is followed by years of flat prices; buyers lower their offers, but most sellers hold out, waiting for better times rather than selling at a loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even a leveling off can be painful for people who have stretched their finances to the limit and are counting on a quick killing in real estate to produce college or retirement funds, says Mike Sklarz, chief valuation officer at Fidelity National Financial Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the decline in interest rates has made housing more affordable for most people in recent years, even though house prices have risen. But Fidelity National's affordability index for some cities is worrisome. The index shows that the typical consumer in Miami can afford only 83% of the city's median house price. The readings are even scarier in Los Angeles (68%), San Diego (65%) and San Francisco (63%). Those numbers suggest that lots of people are getting priced out of the market, which eventually should help restrain prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few housing pundits see much risk of a national plunge in house prices. Indeed, according to David Lereah, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, there has never been an annual decline in the national median price in the past four decades. Even in the recession of the late 1980s, he says, prices edged up slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">January is likely to be another busy month because the recent drop in interest rates allows people to buy more house for the same monthly payment. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate stood at 5.64% last week, the lowest since last July and down from 8.3% four years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's very hard to concoct a scenario where housing is going to fall out of bed anytime soon," says Mr. Lereah. Demand for housing generally exceeds supply, he says. The recent numbers have been so strong that he is considering an upward revision in his forecast that the median house price will rise 4.6% this year and that sales of existing homes will total 5.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders, returning from their annual show in Las Vegas last week, also are whooping it up. The National Association of Home Builders predicts that housing starts this year will be almost as strong as last year's record pace, despite earlier talk of a slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a local level, though, prices do sometimes fall. For instance, data from Fiserv CSW Inc. show that prices in Los Angeles dropped about 29% from 1990 to early 1996. (Adjusted for inflation, the drop was 40%.) San Francisco had a decline of 14% in the early 1990s, and Boston slumped 16%. More recently, some Bay Area cities, such as Saratoga and Cupertino, have suffered steep drops, according to data from Mr. Sklarz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coe Lewis, an agent at Century 21 Award who represents the Bachmans of San Diego, says some people worry too much about prices. "They get paralyzed," Ms. Lewis says. "They almost overthink the process. They think there's got to be a dip. There's not going to be a dip. I'm not afraid at all of a bubble in Southern California."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Messrs. Case and Shiller, however, see signs that a bubble mentality has developed in some of the hotter markets. Last year they surveyed 700 people who had recently bought homes. The survey found that many of these people had very high -- and probably unrealistic -- expectations of how much home prices would keep rising. On average, respondents in the San Francisco area thought prices would rise nearly 16% a year over the coming decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another sign of self-delusion: Some people surveyed thought prices in places like San Francisco and Boston should continue to rise faster than those elsewhere because they are such attractive places to live and there is little space for new housing. Those factors do explain why home prices in those cities are relatively high, the authors note, but they don't mean that prices should keep on rising at a faster rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alas, write Messrs. Case and Shiller, "the single-family home market is a market of amateurs, generally with no economic training."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing homes rose 6.9% in December, the National Association of Realtors said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes reached 6.1 million units for all of 2003. "That shatters the previous record of 5.56 million in 2002," said NAR Chief Economist David Lereah. "The strong sales combined with limited inventory led to a 7.5% price appreciation for the entire year. That's the strongest since 1980, which was 11.7%." Sales last year were up 9.6% from 2002.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales rose to an annual rate of 6.47 million units last month, up from November's revised 6.05 million annual pace. November sales had previously been reported at a 6.06 million annual rate, down 4.6% from October.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The December figure exceeded economists' expectations for a relatively flat annual rate of 6.07 million homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market has remained strong for the past several years, including during the 2001 recession. Although mortgage rates inched up somewhat last summer, they hovered at historically low levels during 2003. The average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 5.88% in December, according to Freddie Mac.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, the inventory of existing homes on the market fell 7.3% to a 4.3-month supply, from five months in November. The median home price rose to $173,200 in December, compared with a revised $169,900 in November.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales increased across the U.S. last month, rising 7.9% in the West, 9.4% in the Midwest, 5.3% in the South and 2.9% in the Northeast.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing continues to boom because interest rates continue at historical lows," Mr. Lereah said.  </p>

That was up 1.7% from the previous month and was the fastest pace of home starts since February 1984. For all of 2003, builders started 1.85 million units, the most aggressive construction pace since 1978, when baby boomers were charging into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around the middle of last year -- as mortgage rates began to shoot up -- many economists predicted the housing market would deflate by now. But that hasn't happened. One reason for the surprise is that interest rates have begun to sink again. Last week, rates on a conventional 30-year fixed rate mortgage sank to 5.66%, the lowest level since mid-July, according to Freddie Mac, the mortgage-finance company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists still expect the pace of home construction to slow this year. According to a December survey by The Wall Street Journal, housing starts are expected to slip to 1.7 million units in 2004. There are some signs a slowdown might be looming. For instance, new-home sales declined 2.4% in November to the slowest pace in six months and the backlog of homes for sale has begun to creep up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, a slowdown is far from certain. Other indicators suggest housing has considerable momentum. Yesterday's report showed builders in December received a rising level of permits to build new homes, a leading indicator of future activity. Building permits rose 3.3% to a 1.924 million annual rate. Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said its mortgage application "purchase index," which tracks mortgages obtained to purchase a home rather than refinance, increased 12.5% to 501.6 in mid-January, a record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With mortgage rates blipping down again, and, we believe, job markets improving, fundamentals look decent for starts early this quarter," said Susan Hering, an economist with UBS Investment Research, in a note to clients. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WESTFIELD, N.J. -- After she was laid off from her technical-support job at a hospital, Eulondia Reese-Turner spent months searching for computer work. Then her husband suggested she try a much hotter segment of the economy: residential real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a big downside: A lot of other people had the same idea. As a newly licensed real-estate agent at the Burgdorff ERA real-estate brokerage here, Ms. Reese-Turner is now competing with a swelling pool of agents. She is working as many as 12 hours a day to find clients and sometimes takes on people snubbed by other agents for being too picky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thousands of refugees from corporate downsizings and outsourced technology departments have begun jumping into real-estate sales -- and are finding it a much tougher field than they expected. The housing market is starting to cool off, meaning all those new agents are competing for a dwindling number of clients. At the same time, the Internet is making consumers less reliant on their friendly neighborhood agent for information. The result is likely to be a drop in income for many agents -- but better service and lower commissions for consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the surface, real estate seems the perfect refuge for frustrated job seekers. Fueled by the lowest short-term interest rates in 45 years, housing sales and prices have surged. As immigrants buy starter houses, more established American families trade up to fancier homes. Some agents make six-figure incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, though, home sales have begun to slow, partly because mortgage interest rates rose modestly in the second half of 2003. The National Association of Realtors projects a 5% fall in sales of existing homes in 2004 to 5.8 million from last year's record 6.1 million. Existing-home sales are the largest part of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, even with that decline, home sales would be at the second-highest level ever, and some economists are predicting housing will stay hot, particularly in the market for new homes. The risk to such forecasts is that home sales probably will slump further if interest rates rise more steeply than expected or if the U.S. continues to export jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the rosier forecasts come true, more agents will be chasing fewer transactions in 2004. Membership in the NAR, which includes most of the nation's more active agents and brokers, has surged 27% in the past three years to 977,000. More are on the way: Schools that train people for real-estate licensing exams report booming enrollment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the residential real-estate industry has a boom-time mentality reminiscent of the one that pervaded Silicon Valley and Wall Street in the late 1990s. "The great thing about real estate is that we upsize, we don't downsize," says Bill Spadea, head of career development at Weichert Realtors, a brokerage that operates on the East Coast. Weichert recruits corporate-layoff victims as well as fresh university graduates who no longer see corporate jobs as secure. Mr. Spadea says the best recruits already have business skills and know how to smile at customers -- "even when they're talking on the phone."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Helping to fuel the boom: Unlike most businesses, real-estate brokerage firms don't need to worry much about hiring too many people. That's because nearly all agents work as independent contractors for brokerage firms, not as employees. The brokerage firms don't pay salaries or benefits. Agents make money only when they earn commissions by completing transactions. Whether they are doing deals or not, the agents have to pay such hefty expenses as car and cellphone costs out of their own pockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, it's easy to become an agent. In New Jersey, for instance, students must complete 75 hours of course work at a licensed school, then pass a state examination. By contrast, obtaining a hairstyling license requires 1,200 hours of instruction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The glut of agents will add downward pressure on commissions, says Steve Murray, editor of Real Trends, an industry newsletter. He estimates that the average commission already has declined to 5.1% from 6% in the early 1990s, partly because most people now search on the Internet before riding around in a car with an agent. While trawling the Web, prospective buyers find pitches from discount brokers offering commissions as low as 2% of the sale price. Foxtons, a four-year-old discount brokerage firm that operates in the New York region, touts 2% commissions with such slogans as "Pay off your mortgage, not your Realtor" and "Beware of sharks charging 6%."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some upstart agents are willing to work for peanuts to build up business. Frank Borges LLosa, a 29-year-old computer whiz who became an agent last year, recently agreed to serve as the agent for the sellers of a Tudor house in McLean, Va., listed at $2.7 million. His fee: $1. Mr. LLosa figures he's getting great publicity by having his sign on the lawn of such a swanky house. And he hopes the owners will use him when they buy their next home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even at 5% or 6%, commissions aren't as lucrative as they seem. In a typical sale, the agents representing the buyer and the seller each get around 2.5% to 3%. On a $300,000 sale, that would be $7,500 to $9,000 each. The agents then share as much as half of their take with the brokerage firms where they work. The most successful agents, who bring in lots of business, can persuade the brokerage firm to take a smaller cut of each deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2002, the latest year for which data are available, median income for agents was $39,300, according to the NAR. Given the slowing market and the huge influx of competition, the typical agent's income is almost certain to fall this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elyse Eskanos of Denver says she used to make as much as $150,000 in annual commissions. That fell to $40,000 or less in recent years as more and more people became agents. "Everybody has a friend or a relative who's a realtor," Ms. Eskanos says. She found that some people planning to sell houses were interviewing five or six agents, then choosing the one who offered to work for the smallest commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After deciding "I'm just sick of it," Ms. Eskanos last year gave up real estate. She now runs a Denver bar called the Dirty Duck, featuring the "best burgers east of I-25."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokerage firms have no trouble finding recruits, though. At Weichert headquarters in Morris Plains, N.J., call-center operators ring a bell every time they get someone to commit to attend a seminar for prospective agents. Last year, 30,000 people agreed to attend those seminars, and over 2,000 became Weichert agents. On a recent morning, the recruitment bell was dinging every minute or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's crop of newcomers is different from the stereotypical real-estate agent: a suburban mom or a retiree seeking part-time work for extra income. "It used to be people who came because of the flexible schedule. Translation: `I don't have to work that hard,' " says Greg Rand, managing partner of Prudential Rand Realty in White Plains, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, he says, many new agents are hard-chargers with lots of business experience and computer skills who are primary breadwinners for their families. Many have lost good jobs and need to replace the income. Mr. Rand thinks some of these newcomers will outperform old-timers who aren't willing to work as hard or haven't developed computer skills needed to do research and communicate efficiently with customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median age of NAR members is 51. But operators of some training schools report a big influx of younger people. A recent survey at Anthony Real Estate Schools, part of Washington Post Co.'s Kaplan subsidiary, found that 43% of students preparing for real-estate license exams were under 35. People in the industry say low interest rates have allowed more young people to buy houses and, in the process, given many of them the temptation to try their luck as agents. As computer skills become more important in selling real estate, some young people also think they will have an edge over veteran technophobes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Computers and the Internet are a mixed blessing for agents. Agents can save time by using e-mail to communicate with their customers. They can avoid some fruitless house-viewing trips by encouraging customers to look at offerings on the Web first. But the Internet also changes the way some people choose an agent. One common way to find an agent is to ask a friend for a recommendation, giving agents with the biggest social circles an advantage. Now a growing number of people are open to finding an agent online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Online brokerage firms such as eRealty Inc. and zipRealty Inc. several years ago began attracting customers by putting large amounts of information about houses on their Web sites. "Customers are able to choose the homes they want to see instead of having agents suggest what they should see," says Sonia Taylor, a spokeswoman for zipRealty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now traditional bricks-and-mortar brokerage firms are working harder on their Internet marketing. Weichert last year opened a call center to respond to people who click for more information on Internet ads. Weichert's aim is to call those potential customers within 60 seconds of receiving the e-mail. People surf from one site to another so fast that "it's really a race for the customer," says Bret A. Violette, who runs the Internet operation. When the call-center employees connect with a good prospect, they immediately patch that person through to a Weichert agent's cellphone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a catch for the agents, though: If those Web-harvested customers complete a transaction, the agent has to turn over a much bigger-than-usual slice of the commission to Weichert. Mr. Violette says that bigger slice is needed to pay for the costs of the call center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Reese-Turner, the former hospital employee, needs to help her husband, a school-bus inspector, meet mortgage payments, raise three children and care for aged relatives. Even if it means working long hours six or seven days a week, the 45-year-old Ms. Reese-Turner plans to stick with her new job in real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(MORE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Reese-Turner hoped to sell houses to former colleagues from her hospital job. But some of them have recently lost their jobs and others are so fearful of layoffs that they don't want to make big financial commitments. To cast a wider net, she wears her Burgdorff name tag everywhere, even while shopping or visiting the doctor, and volunteers to work at open houses organized by colleagues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one recent event, she met Ruth Skerritt-Abraham. Over the past year, two other agents had given up on Ms. Skerritt-Abraham, who works as a middle manager at an insurance company. She says those agents decided it would be too difficult to find something in her price range that she would want. With few other customers, however, Ms. Reese-Turner was willing to try her luck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first house they visited was on a short street just off a major highway. At one corner was an adult video shop. A rusting shopping cart lay on its side in a vacant lot across from the house. Ms. Reese-Turner searched for something positive to say, then offered: "You have few neighbors." Ms. Skerritt-Abraham didn't even get out of the car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next house looked more promising, but the tiny backyard was in the shadow of a highway overpass. Ms. Skerritt-Abraham again decided not to go inside. The two women fled the next house after finding a young man, surrounded by fast-food wrappers, in a deep sleep on the third floor. Ms. Skerritt-Abraham then rejected the next several houses because the yards were too small. "I'm picky," she said softly. "I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No, no," Ms. Reese-Turner replied. "This is a life decision."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 7 p.m., the tour was complete. As she got out of the car, Ms. Skerritt-Abraham said she might want to go back to one house with her husband. Ms. Reese-Turner, having already put about 70 miles on her car during the day, headed back to the office to check her e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next day Ms. Skerritt-Abraham called to say her husband thought they should be looking at bigger houses. Ms. Reese-Turner seemed to have wasted a day, but she sounded upbeat. She noted that while driving she received two calls on her cellphone from potential clients among her circle of family and friends. "Things are starting to move!" she said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jim Carlton </div><div>405 words</div><div>20 January 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAS VEGAS -- The National Association of Home Builders forecast a continued healthy housing market and said this year's results could rival last year's if the current low interest-rate environment continues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Seiders, chief economist for the Washington-based builders group, forecast 1.45 million single-family housing starts this year, a drop of about 3% from last year's 1.5 million but still a historically high number. However, Mr. Seiders said his estimate may well prove conservative because continued weakness in job growth and other factors are putting pressure on mortgage rates to stay low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing has boomed in recent years even as other portions of the economy have faltered. The boom was driven in part by low interest rates, which set mortgage rates and helped bring them down to their lowest levels in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Seiders, presenting his forecast at the International Builders' Show in Las Vegas, expects low interest rates to continue. He forecasts that the surprisingly weak December employment data reported earlier this month and the continued low inflation rate will make gains in the short-term rates controlled by the Federal Reserve less likely this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists point out that other factors that have been driving housing sales -- including rising consumer confidence and a growing pool of immigrant buyers -- are likely to remain in play for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, several builders report little let-up from last year's blistering pace in housing activity. Executives at Toll Brothers Inc., a Huntingdon Valley, Pa., builder, say they are backlogged with orders for the rest of their fiscal year, which ends in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another big builder, Dallas-based Centex Corp., reports continued strong activity following a December-ended fiscal third quarter during which orders rose 9% over a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing prospects aren't uniform nationwide; the association predicts slower activity in states like Oregon and Ohio, which have been hit by manufacturing cutbacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing appreciation, meanwhile, is expected to cool somewhat this year. New-home prices should rise an average of 5% in 2004 from increases of nearly 8% in each of the past two years, David Berson, chief economist for mortgage titan Fannie Mae, said in a report released at the builders show. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The pace of U.S. construction spending climbed to a record in November, pushed higher by home building. Outlays on construction rose 1.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $934.5 billion, the U.S. Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street was expecting a smaller increase of 0.5% in November outlays. The advance followed an upwardly revised 1.1% rise in October. Spending for October was estimated as a 0.9% gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report showed residential construction advanced 1.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $501.6 billion in November. The U.S. housing sector remained strong through the economy's slump and into last year, when gross-domestic-product growth accelerated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low mortgage rates have been driving home buying. Government data showed home-building activity rising to its highest level in nearly 20 years in November. Housing starts advanced by 4.5% to a seasonally adjusted 2.07 million annual rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report showed office construction rose 1.3%, while outlays on highways and streets climbed 4.1%. Health-care construction fell 1.7%.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outlays on construction rose 1.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $934.5 billion (742.18 billion euros), the U.S. Commerce Department said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street was expecting a smaller increase of 0.5% in November outlays. The advance followed an upwardly revised 1.1% rise in October. Spending for October was estimated as a 0.9% gain.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report showed residential construction advanced 1.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $501.6 billion in November. The U.S. housing sector remained strong through the economy's slump and into last year, when gross-domestic-product growth accelerated.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Patrick Barta and Ray Smith </div><div>1181 words</div><div>2 January 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>R16</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE RESIDENTIAL real-estate market defied expectations in 2003, remaining robust through a fragile economic recovery. But by some measures, the long-running housing boom showed signs of moderating, leading many analysts to predict a less frenetic -- though still healthy -- market for 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outlook for commercial real estate, on the other hand, remains somewhat less sanguine. While the industry performed well for investors in 2003, sky-high vacancy rates in offices, apartments and industrial properties could weigh on prices and returns this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For home sales, 2003 was a blockbuster year, based on the latest numbers. In November, for example, sales of pre-existing homes clocked in at their fifth-highest monthly pace ever, extending a long streak of stellar monthly sales reports. According to projections from Fannie Mae, the giant mortgage-finance company, Americans will have bought some 6.02 million existing homes and 1.07 million new homes by year end, pushing total home sales in 2003 to all-time highs. Meanwhile, new-home construction in November soared to its highest level in 19 years, reflecting continued optimism by builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of this strength can be attributed to interest rates, which fell to their lowest levels in a generation in early summer. The average rate on the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dipped to just above 5%. Although rates started to head back up in the fall, in the short run that only served to stir up more activity, by encouraging many home buyers who had been sitting on the fence to buy quickly before rates went higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, by some measures, the market wasn't as frenzied as in 2002 and 2001, when fears of a possible housing "bubble" became widespread. Average U.S. home prices, for example, rose 5.61% during the year ended in September, the most recent period for which data are available. Home-price appreciation has been cooling since the middle of 2001, when annual home-price growth hit a recent peak of 8.24%. Also, despite the record sales nationwide, numerous markets remained noticeably weaker than a few years ago, among them Texas, Colorado and parts of North Carolina.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The luxury-home market continues to struggle, as the pool of rich impulse buyers, which expanded during the late 1990s boom, has dried up due to a tougher economy. Real-estate agents report that bidding wars between buyers -- a sure sign of overheated market activity -- have become far less common in many parts of the country, though they are still occurring in some places, particularly parts of the Northeast and California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heading into 2004, most analysts expect interest rates to begin climbing anew once the recent economic recovery gains more traction, which could ultimately sap demand for homes, especially after so many families accelerated their plans to buy houses in 2002 and 2003 while interest rates were so low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market "is probably going to tail off in the second half of the year," says Steve Wood, chief economist at Insight Economics in Danville, Calif. He says home-price growth should slow to an annual rate of about 3% to 4% in 2004 and slightly lower than that in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, few economists are expecting an outright collapse of the housing market in 2004. David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, notes that a stronger economy in 2004 should lead to more job growth, creating some new demand for homes. While activity likely will slow a little, he says, "we're hard pressed to think of serious problems evolving in 2004."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial real-estate industry could certainly benefit from any job growth this year. The office sector has suffered mightily from corporate cutbacks, with the national vacancy rate rising to an average of about 17.1% in 2003, from 16% in 2002, according to Reis Inc., a New York-based real-estate research firm. The 2003 rate is the highest since 1993, when it was 17.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, the average national apartment vacancy rate rose to about 6.9% in 2003 -- the highest level since 7.2% in 1988 -- from 6.3% in 2002, according to Reis. The industrial vacancy rate rose to 11.8%, the highest since Reis began tracking the market in 1980. Industrial vacancies were 11.2% in 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the awful fundamentals, commercial real estate continued to attract institutional and individual investors. A record $4.5 billion flowed into real-estate mutual funds, which hold the stocks of publicly traded real-estate investment trusts, as of Dec. 23, 2003, according to AMG Data Services, of Arcata, Calif. That was the highest inflow amount since 1997, when $4.13 billion poured into the funds. About $3.4 billion was invested in real-estate mutual funds in 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bucks didn't end there. Fueled by low interest rates, individuals and institutions bought lots of properties directly, too. Transaction volume totaled about $113.8 billion in 2003, up from $102.5 billion in 2002, according to Real Capital Analytics Inc., a New York-based real-estate research firm. Meanwhile, property prices, especially high-quality, well-leased buildings, rose through the roof. The average price for a high-quality office building in a central business district rose to $293 a square foot in 2003, up from $252 a square foot in 2002, Real Capital Analytics says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial properties returned 1.97% to institutional investors as of the third quarter of 2003, up from 1.79% for the year-earlier period, according to the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries, a Chicago-based association of institutional real-estate professionals. Real-estate investment trusts returned 37.5% to investors in 2003, up from 3.6% in 2002, according to the Morgan Stanley REIT index, marking the fourth straight year REITs have outperformed the S&amp;P 500-Stock index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But investments in real estate, be it through REITs or actual properties, could slow in 2004 as other sectors rebound and become more attractive, taking back investors who sought stability in real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks of public REITs aren't inexpensive, trading at 12.5 times the next four quarters' earnings, above their historical average multiple of 10.2 times, according to Lee Schalop, an analyst at Banc of America Securities in New York. "That suggests there's more downside than upside for REITs in 2004," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the commercial-property level, some expect the deterioration in real-estate market conditions to either cease or slow considerably. "We don't see vacancy moving appreciably from here up or down [across the board] at least over the near term," says Barry A. Ziering, senior director, research and strategy at SSR Realty Advisors, a Morristown, N.J., real-estate advisory and management firm. "While we have seen employment growth starting to pick up, it's still below the levels really needed to bring down the vacancy in any material way." </p>

</div><div class="author">By Ray A. Smith </div><div>1140 words</div><div>31 December 2003</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2003, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ASHLEY BANDER moved from an apartment to a two-bedroom, two-bath home in Tysons Corner, Va., without having to change her address, phone number or pack anything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's because the 24-year-old purchased her rental apartment in a stylish apartment complex called the Fountains of McLean, owned by Miami-based Crescent Heights Development, when it was converted into a condominium last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bander bought into a housing trend that has taken up steam: rondos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rondos are condominium units, typically in higher-end buildings, that have been converted from rental apartments. Such conversions were big in the 1980s. Now they're back -- thanks to the strength of the housing market, with low interest rates and favorable lender policies allowing for low to no down payments, as well as weak rental-apartment market conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transaction volume of apartments purchased for condominium conversion totaled about $1.466 billion as of Dec. 29, up from $670 million in 2002 and $526 million in 2001, according to Real Capital Analytics Inc., a New York-based real-estate research firm. In unit terms, volume totaled 11,168 as of Dec. 29, compared with 5,865 in 2002 and 3,910 in 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the bulk of conversions in recent years had been limited to Atlanta, Chicago, Phoenix, and Miami, the trend is spreading to new markets like Las Vegas, Los Angeles, lower Manhattan, Orlando, Seattle and Tampa, Real Capital Analytics says. In the Washington, D.C.-area, for instance, 2,000 rondos were projected to be ready between July and January, double the number of a year ago, according to Delta Associates, an Alexandria, Va.-based consulting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for condominiums in general has been so strong that it has prompted some big rental-apartment developers such as Atlanta-based Trammell Crow Residential to not only sell their buildings to condo developers but also to switch their plans midstream, starting out projects as rental apartments and then turning around and making them condominiums instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And with poor rental-market conditions nationwide forcing landlords to lower rents and give concessions such as two months free rent, apartment owners can make more money by selling or converting. More than 10% of about 300 respondents to a National Association of Home Builders survey conducted over the summer indicated they were planning to convert some existing rental units into condos in the near future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest condo-conversion trend reflects the continued strength of the U.S. housing market, which has been the economy's pillar over the past three years. It also reflects the extent to which condos have become a major force in the nation's housing market. Condominiums have been a fast-rising segment of the overall housing market, especially as interest rates fell, making them more affordable. Sales of existing condos and co-ops rose to 820,000 units in 2002, up from 746,000 units in 2001, according to the National Association of Realtors. The organization expects 2003 sales to reach close to 900,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the conversions highlight the continued weakness of the rental-apartment industry, which has been plagued by high vacancies, low interest rates prompting would-be renters to become home buyers and overbuilding in certain markets for the past three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average vacancy rate for apartments in the top 50 U.S. metropolitan markets rose to abour 6.9% in 2003 -- the highest level since 1998 when it was 7.2% -- from 6.3% a year earlier, according to Reis Inc., a New York real-estate research firm. Three years ago, the vacancy rate was just 3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boom in conversions is a double-edge sword for the apartment industry. "Some would say the current boom in condo construction and conversions of rental units into condos is good news, that it reduces rental supply," says Gleb Nechayev, an economist with Torto Wheaton Research, a Boston-based real-estate research firm. "But the way I see it, it also reduces rental demand because those who will go after those condos are more likely to currently be in the rental-demand pool. It's taking away a share of rental demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, there is the chance that more and more developers will jump on the condo-conversion bandwagon and ultimately flood the market with condos. If interest rates rise, interest from potential buyers could fade, leaving unsold condos across the U.S. but some good deals for buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condominiums appeal especially to young people and empty nesters, who want to live in or very near to cities and who don't want or need a whole house -- and the raking of lawns, shoveling of snow, hiring of plumbers and other responsibilities that come with owning one. (Condo owners pay maintenance fees that cover the costs for someone else to take care of such things.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, in many areas of the country, condominiums are less expensive than single-family homes, though the gap has narrowed as strong demand for condos has driven up prices. The national median price of a condo rose to $167,200 in the third quarter from $143,400 in the third quarter of 2002, according to the National Association of Realtors. That compares with $177,000 and $160,800, respectively, for a single-family home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rondos are proving to be popular as well. One reason is that they are generally less expensive than new or existing condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, the average price of a rondo in the Washington, D.C., area can range from $160,000 to $600,000, compared with between $300,000 and more than $1 million for an original condo, according to a survey conducted by Delta Associates. They cost less partly because they tend to be smaller since they were designed as apartments -- 600 to 1,200 square feet compared with 700 to 1,800 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rondos also give people who were renters in the building extra incentives to buy: They are approached before the general public and are given discounted prices. Mid-City Urban LLC, a Silver Spring, Md.-based developer, offered renters a discount of $10,000 below market rate to buy condos in a converted apartment complex in Ashburn, Va. About 20% of the renters in the 339-unit complex bought units, the company says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Obrinsky, chief economist of the National Multi Housing Council, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group, concedes that conversions could move a renter already considering buying into home ownership quicker. But, he adds, "it's not likely that it creates a homeowner who was not looking to become an owner." </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing homes continued to soften in November, dropping 4.6% from October, the National Association of Realtors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales fell to a 6.06 million annual rate in November, down from October's 6.35 million annual pace, which was down 4.9% from a record set in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We peaked in September. Yes, it's a 4.6% drop, but we're still at lofty levels," said NAR Chief Economist David Lereah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It appears that housing demand has cooled modestly from this summer's unsustainably torrid pace but remains incredibly strong by any reasonable standard," said Steve Stanley, economist at RBS Greenwich Capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although mortgage rates inched up somewhat this summer, they have hovered at historically low levels all year with the average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages at 5.93% in November, according to Freddie Mac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, the inventory of existing homes on the market increased to five months, from October's 4.6 months, the NAR said. The median existing-home price was $170,900 in November, up 5.9% from November 2002. Half of homes sell for more than the median, half sell for less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes were down in all regions, falling 2.4% in the West, 6.6% in the Midwest, and 4.1% in the Northeast and 5.1% in the South. Separately, the Conference Board said that its consumer-confidence index for December fell to 91.3 from a revised 92.5 in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The present situation index, a gauge of consumers' assessment of current economic conditions, dropped sharply to 73.9, from a revised 81 the prior month. Meanwhile, the index of consumer expectations for the state of economic activity over the next six months increased to 102.9 from a revised 100.1 in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumers' lackluster assessment of current conditions reflects continuing anxiety about labor-market conditions," economist Lynn Franco of the Conference Board, a New York-based research organization, said in a written statement. Still, she added that "the improvement in consumers' expectations signals healthy economic growth in 2004."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board said those who say jobs are "hard to get" rose to 32.6% in December from 29.6% the month before. Those who deemed jobs "plentiful" fell to 12.5% of respondents, versus 13.5% in November. But looking ahead, the survey found that households expect an improvement in labor-market conditions over coming months.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Elizabeth Price and Jeff Bater Dow Jones Newswires  </div><div>484 words</div><div>29 December 2003</div><div>The Asian Wall Street Journal</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2003 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The manufacturing sector's recent recovery appeared to hit a pothole last month as orders for big-ticket items unexpectedly fell for the first time since August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dragged down by reduced demand for computers, communications equipment and aircraft, orders for durable goods -- those meant to last three or more years -- dropped 3.1% in November to $180.1 billion from October, the Commerce Department said. Offsetting that, the increase in orders for October was revised upward to 4% from the previously estimated 3.4%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimates on durable goods are volatile and subject to sizable revisions. Furthermore, other data suggest the manufacturing sector is in good shape. The Institute for Supply Management's index of manufacturing activity posted its strongest reading since 1983 in November and U.S. industrial production showed its biggest gain in four years during the month. The Commerce Department said actual shipments, as opposed to orders, of durable goods rose 0.1% last month.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The manufacturing sector's recent recovery appeared to hit a pothole last month as orders for big-ticket items unexpectedly fell for the first time since August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dragged down by reduced demand for computers, communications equipment and aircraft, orders for durable goods -- those meant to last three or more years -- dropped 3.1% in November to $180.1 billion from October, the Commerce Department said. Offsetting that, the increase in orders for October was revised up to 4% from the previously estimated 3.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimates on durable goods are volatile and subject to sizable revisions. Furthermore, other data suggest the manufacturing sector is in good shape. The Institute for Supply Management's index of manufacturing activity posted its strongest reading since 1983 in November and U.S. industrial production showed its biggest gain in four years during the month. The Commerce Department said actual shipments, as opposed to orders, of durable goods rose 0.1% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-defense capital-goods orders excluding aircraft, a key gauge of business investment, were off 5.9%. Transportation orders fell 1.6%, dragged lower by waning demand for both defense and non-defense aircraft. Orders for cars and parts sank 1.2%.

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>917 words</div><div>24 December 2003</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2003, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ONLINE REAL ESTATE brokers, who once promised sizable discounts on the standard commission for selling houses, have quietly raised their rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ERealty Inc., a pioneering online broker, has dropped from its Web site an offer to sell homes for a 4.5% commission, well below the 6% commission charged by many traditional brokers. The Houston-based company also stopped giving buyers a rebate equal to 1% of the purchase price. Now, like most real-estate brokers, eRealty will negotiate commissions on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move comes about a year after another online broker, zipRealty Inc., Emeryville, Calif., stopped promising 4.5% commissions. The company says the average now is around 4.75%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ERealty's fee increases came after the company concluded that its emphasis on discounting was scaring away some potential customers who want lots of personal service. ERealty says the new fees make it clear that it's a full-service broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both eRealty and zipRealty say they still offer lower commissions than most of the big-name chains. But the increased commissions show that the Internet has failed to create the revolution in home buying and selling that was widely anticipated just a few years ago. Some traditional brokers feared that Internet sites would provide an easy way of connecting buyers and sellers, making a professional intermediary less important -- and slashing commissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While those fears haven't been realized, commissions have been eroding throughout the industry. Real Trends, an industry newsletter, estimates that commissions across the U.S. averaged 5.12% in 2002, down from around 6% in the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downward pressure on commissions has also been fueled by the explosion in housing values. As home prices have ballooned, brokers can afford to work for a smaller cut. When a home's price rises to $500,000 from $400,000, a 5% commission rises to $25,000 from $20,000. Low interest rates have resulted in a boom in housing sales. The National Association of Realtors estimates that the national median price for existing single-family homes surged 9.1% this year, well above the long-run trend of around 5% annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly, not all firms are backing away from cut-rate commissions. Foxtons, which operates in New York City and surrounding suburbs in New Jersey and Connecticut, aggressively promotes its 2% commissions. The firm heavily advertises with slogans such as "Pay off your mortgage, not your Realtor."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foxtons is challenging one of the industry's holiest shrines: the multiple listing service, or MLS. Under local MLS agreements, brokers pool information on their listings and show one another's houses, splitting commissions on sales. That encourages brokers to cooperate rather than duke it out over fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under its 2% plan, Foxtons doesn't use an MLS, saving itself the expense of sharing commissions with other firms. That means rival brokers won't show Foxtons-listed houses, narrowing the range of potential buyers. But Foxtons says its advertising drives plenty of potential buyers to its Web site, where they can preview homes and set up appointments to see them. The actual showing of homes is left to the seller rather than an agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rival brokers say customers want more hand-holding, but Foxtons argues that some of the things traditional agents do, such as attending closings, are unnecessary expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some full-service firms have experimented with their own cut-rate options. For instance, Coldwell Banker, a unit of Cendant Corp., is testing a service dubbed Blue Edge in parts of Pennsylvania and Illinois, offering 2% commissions for a reduced level of service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One problem for sellers in evaluating the varying levels of service is that it's impossible to know which one will produce the maximum sale price for any given house. Some customers are willing to pay a big commission because they think a particular agent has the skills and contacts to jack up the sale price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Internet merchants long ago slashed costs for such things as travel and stock trading, online operators remain a small presence in residential real estate, with a market share estimated at less than 1% of U.S. sales of existing homes. That isn't as insignificant as it seems, though, because real estate is very much a local business with thousands of tiny firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ERealty and zipRealty are among the most prominent survivors from the dot-com era, when online real-estate firms proliferated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the flameouts was Homebytes.com, which shut down in 2001 because it couldn't raise more venture capital, said Craig Weber, who was Homebytes's chief operating officer. Homebytes offered to list houses for a flat fee of $599. Some consumers couldn't believe they would get decent service at that rate, he says, adding: "It's almost as if we created a model that seemed too good to be true."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">                   How to Choose The Right Broker 
 
 
   -- Traditional brokers like Century 21 or Re/Max offer lots of hand- 
holding for people who want others to sweat the details. Typical commission: 
5% to 6% 
 
   -- Online brokers like eRealty and zipRealty cater to consumers who like 
to do a lot of research before they view homes. Typical commission: 5% 
 
   -- Discounters like Foxtons keep fees low by having buyers show their own

</div><div class="author">By Greg Ip  </div><div>573 words</div><div>17 December 2003</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2003, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Underlying inflation dropped to its lowest level in the U.S. in 40 years last month, as ample slack in the economy continued to put downward pressure on prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as industrial production and home construction surged, the consumer price index fell 0.2% in November from October, mostly on a drop in energy costs, the Labor Department said. That cut the 12-month rise to 1.8% from 2.1%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, "core" consumer prices, an indicator of underlying inflation, declined 0.1% in November, the first monthly decline since 1982. That brought the 12-month rate of change down to 1.1%, the lowest core inflation rate since 1963, from 1.3% in October.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separate reports showed that in the same month, industrial production surged 0.9%, its biggest gain in four years, and housing starts rose 4.5% to a 19-year high annual rate of 2.07 million units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in prices surprised economists and probably also surprised the Federal Reserve, which last week said the risks of an "unwelcome fall in inflation" were "almost" equal to the risk of an increase, breaking a seven-month stretch in which it firmly placed inflation risks on the downside.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An underlying inflation rate of 1.1% is getting uncomfortably low for Fed officials, many of whom want a buffer of at least 1% against outright deflation, or declining prices. Still, it is probably too soon to conclude deflationary risks have returned. The drop in November prices may be an anomaly. It was heavily influenced by a sharp drop in the prices of consumer goods such as apparel and furniture. But other data suggest that goods prices are stabilizing as the lower dollar feeds through to higher prices for imports and increased pricing power for U.S. business. Inflation was also restrained by a mere 0.1% rise in the cost of home ownership, but statistical distortions related to fluctuating natural-gas prices have cast doubt on the reliability of that measure.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, the Fed believes inflation will be determined by how much unused business capacity and high unemployment continue to put downward pressure on wages and prices. Both are diminishing as the expansion gathers steam. The November surge in industrial production meant U.S. factories were operating at 75.7% of capacity, the highest since September 2002, up from a revised 75.1% in October, according to data released by the Fed Tuesday. That is still well below the 80% to 82% range associated with an economy operating at normal strength with no bottlenecks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Production was boosted by rising output of capital goods, a sign that business investment continues to improve. Technology-industry output jumped 4.1% and is up 27.5% in the past 12 months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November's rise in housing construction shows the Fed's commitment to keep its short-term interest-rate target low for a "considerable period" -- which has kept mortgage rates low -- keeps paying dividends. The Commerce Department said single-family starts rose by 3.3%, setting another record at a 1.695 million annual rate. Multifamily starts rose by 6.3%. But building permits fell 5.4% to a 1.874 million-unit annual rate, suggesting a moderation in new construction ahead.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp;Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE INSTITUTE for Supply Management's manufacturing employment index was above 50 in November for the first time in more than three years, indicating employment growth in the manufacturing sector. An article on the ISM's manufacturing index in yesterday's edition incorrectly said that manufacturing employment rose to the highest level in more than three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ Dec. 3, 2003)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END) </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. manufacturing last month showed the most robust activity in two decades, lifting employment in the sector to the highest level in more than three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The private Institute for Supply Management said its November index of manufacturing activity came in at 62.8, up from 57 for October. Providing solid evidence of an improving manufacturing jobs picture, the ISM's employment index climbed to 51 from 47.7. It marks the first time since September 2000 the gauge exceeded 50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Readings of at least 50 indicate growth in the U.S. industrial sector, which has lagged behind other areas of the American economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic data were stronger than even optimistic forecasts. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and CNBC had expected the overall industrial index to rise to 59 for November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, order backlogs increased and supplier deliveries slowed, indicating that demand is outstripping production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"More and more sectors of manufacturing are beginning to be influenced by the recovery," including steel, said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street cheered the improvement, with major stock indexes extending earlier gains on the news and bond prices, which are sensitive to interest rates, falling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 116.59, or 1.2%, to 9899.05, and the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 29.56, or 1.5%, to 1989.82. The dollar rallied. The euro, which had risen to a high of $1.2040 in London trading, weakened to $1.1975, down from $1.1991 late Friday in New York. The dollar advanced mainly against major European currencies, while heavy selling of euros against the yen limited the dollar's strength against the Japanese currency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calling the survey results "astonishing," Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics Ltd. in Valhalla, N.Y., said the November reading is consistent with an economic growth rate of about 7%. He said the employment survey suggests "the three-year run of industrial-job losses will soon end."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the U.S. Commerce Department said construction spending for October increased a higher-than-expected 0.9%, as residential home building reached unprecedented levels. Big gains also were registered in public projects as federal and state governments have ramped up spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall construction spending rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $922 billion from an upwardly revised $913.5 billion for September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While private residential-construction spending rose 2.2% to a record $484.1 billion from $473.6 billion, private nonresidential construction slipped 2.1%. The decline, the steepest since a 2.3% drop in December 2002, was driven by weakness in construction of commercial facilities, power plants and factories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic reports indicate that U.S. growth is likely to continue. "Based on this data, it appears that the recovery is gaining momentum," said Norbert Ore, who directs the survey for the ISM. "Indications are that the manufacturing sector is ending 2003 on a very positive note, and all of the indexes support continued strength into 2004," he said. </p>
