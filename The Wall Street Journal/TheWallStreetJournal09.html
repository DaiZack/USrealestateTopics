<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HANOI—Three Chinese warships will dock Saturday at Vietnam's strategic naval base at Cam Ranh Bay, three weeks after two U.S. naval vessels docked[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-warships-dock-in-vietnam-1475561601] there for the first time since former wartime foes Hanoi and Washington normalized relations 21 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vietnam has recently made the Cam Ranh Bay base available to visiting foreign naval vessels in an attempt to maintain a strong international presence in the South China Sea amid maritime disputes with China. Beijing has claimed nearly all the strategic waterway, conflicting with claims by Vietnam and other nations including Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese warships with 750 sailors on board will visit the base for four days, during which time they will hold exchange activities with Vietnamese navy sailors, Vietnamese state media reported Wednesday, citing the Department of Foreign Affairs of Khanh Hoa province, where the base is located.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The visit marks an improvement in relations since Vietnam sent patrol vessels to defend its claims against a Chinese drilling rig towed into contested waters[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/vietnam-tells-china-to-remove-oil-rig-from-disputed-waters-1460042757], said Carlyle Thayer, a Vietnam expert and emeritus professor at the <span class="companylink">University of New South Wales</span> and the <span class="companylink">Australian Defense Force Academy</span>. The tensions led to anti-Chinese riots in Vietnam. China eventually withdrew the rig.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vietnam and China subsequently moved to improve ties through high-profile visits and friendly military exchanges on their border. In September, they conducted coordinated coast guard patrols in the Gulf of Tonkin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These exchanges now involve meetings between their respective defense ministers…and the [Chinese navy] visit to Cam Ranh Bay extends these confidence-building measures to the maritime domain," Mr. Thayer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apart from the recent visit by U.S. warships, vessels from Japan, Russia and France have recently docked at Cam Ranh Bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, <span class="companylink">Vietnam's Foreign Ministry</span> spokesman, Le Hai Binh, reaffirmed that Vietnam won't allow other countries to set up military bases at Cam Ranh Bay. The statement followed Russian media reports that Russia was considering reopening Soviet-era bases in the country.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing Starts Fell</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9% in September</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell for the second straight month in September, but builders received more permits, a sign residential construction should pick up in the coming months amid steady demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September's drop in starts was due to an unusually large decline in the volatile multifamily category, but an uptick in permits for multifamily housing indicated the steep fall was likely an aberration. The more stable category of single-family homes posted monthly gains in both permits and starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits issued for privately owned housing units rose 6.3% in September from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.225 million, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Permits for single-family homes, about 60% of all permits, rose to a rate of 739,000, up 0.4% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 9% in September to an annual rate of 1.047 million, as starts on multifamily buildings dropped sharply. But single-family starts continued to climb, rising 8.1% in September to a rate of 783,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September's rise in permits, based on a survey of local governments, had a margin of error of 1.9 percentage points. Last month's decline in starts, based on a survey of builders and homeowners, came with a margin of error of 9.2 percentage points.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">U.S. Transportation Department</span> is proposing that airlines refund fees on bags that arrive very late, own up to more mistakes, and follow other new rules to promote competition between carriers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government officials are soliciting comment on changes that would build on consumer-protection guidelines released in 2009 and 2011 by a Transportation Department that has been proactive in sanctioning carriers for violating consumer and disability rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't clear when rules will be completed, officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several rules will oblige airlines to report more mistakes. For instance, airlines will have to report incidents of mishandled wheelchairs so that travelers with disabilities can compare the service they might receive on different carriers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said the new rules will give air travelers better information about how their airlines are performing and save them from paying for services they don't receive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most onerous rule for major carriers could be requiring them to report some missteps on their regional carrier partners as well as their flagship brand, such as punctuality, mishandled bags and involuntary bumping of passengers on oversold flights.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faculty at 14 public universities in Pennsylvania went on strike Wednesday after contract negotiations between the faculty union and the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education broke down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 100,000 students attend the affected schools, which include <span class="companylink">Millersville University</span>, West Chester University and California University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faculty at <span class="companylink">Penn State University</span>, a public university, the <span class="companylink">University of Pittsburgh</span>, known as a state-related institution, and <span class="companylink">University of Pennsylvania</span>, which is private, aren't involved in the labor action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Association of Pennsylvania State College and University Faculty represents about 5,500 faculty and coaches. The strike is the first in the public university system's 34-year history, according to system spokesman Kenn Marshall. The faculty union contract expired in June 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though they had made some progress in discussions about wages, union President Ken Mash said, the two sides were still far apart on health-care costs, the role of adjunct and temporary faculty, sabbaticals and online courses.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developer Patrick Kennedy wants to build apartments for middle-class families near San Francisco's Financial District, but he is struggling to win the city's approval. The problem: in one spot the building's courtyard is 5 feet too narrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kennedy said his efforts constantly run up against such obstacles, which he said drive up the cost of construction and make it nearly impossible to build anything but luxury housing in one of the nation's most expensive markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The courtyard requirement in the city's planning code is designed to ensure units have sufficient light and air circulation and that the property offers usable outdoor space. Mr. Kennedy said it would force him to eliminate 16 bedrooms from apartments priced about 30% below market rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such requirements are pushing out all but the very rich and creating a kind of economic segregation, he said. "There are a lot of ways you can have modern-day Jim Crow [segregation] through zoning," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this year's election, candidates have focused blame for rising income inequality on broad economic forces, from globalization to the decline of the U.S. manufacturing base. But a growing body of research suggests another factor: The price of the average single-family home for sale, from Fairfield, Conn., to Portland, Ore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to research by Daniel Shoag, an associate professor of public policy at Harvard University, and Peter Ganong, a postdoctoral fellow at the <span class="companylink">National Bureau of Economic Research</span>, a decadeslong trend in which the income gap between the poorest and richest states steadily closed has been upended by growth in land-use regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moving to a wealthier area in search of job opportunities has historically been a way to promote economic equality, allowing workers to pursue higher-paying jobs elsewhere. But wage gains lose their appeal if they are eaten up by higher housing costs. The result: More people stay put and lose out on greater incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the cities with the stiffest demand for housing, and thus the highest prices, are on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. They also tend to be the cities that impose the strictest rules on land use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Messrs. Shoag and Ganong looked at mentions of "land-use" in appeals-court cases and found the number of references began rising sharply around 1970, with some states seeing a much larger increase than others. For example, the share of cases mentioning land use for New York rose 265% between 1950 and 2010 and 644% in California during the same period. By contrast, it increased only 80% in Alabama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rules generally are intended to preserve the historic charm of neighborhoods, ensure sunlight and fresh air can reach the streets, and limit congestion on sidewalks, streets and public transportation. But while such efforts are well intentioned, they are having an unintended side effect: increasing social stratification between wealthier and poorer areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average incomes in a poorer state such as Alabama, for example, rose 73% in the decade starting in 1950, compared with 53% in a richer state like New York, according to Mr. Shoag. In contrast, during the 2000s, average incomes in New York and Alabama grew at virtually the same pace -- 38% -- increasing the wealth gap between the two places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During that time, New York state saw inward migration rates fall off. In 1950, its population was growing by 13% annually, compared with 7% in Alabama. Between 2000 and 2010, the pattern reversed: Population in Alabama grew about 7%, compared with 2% in New York, Mr. Shoag said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The typical home in New York in 1970 cost 4.5 times as much as the income per capita, while a home in Alabama cost about four times what a typical family made. By 2010, that gap had widened significantly, with a home in New York costing six times what a typical family makes and one in Alabama costing roughly 3.5 times as much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are traditionally two ways to change your fate -- get an education or move to a higher-wage part of the country," Mr. Shoag said. "The second channel isn't really available because the prices make that a bad deal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the U.S. as a whole might benefit from making it easier for lower-income residents to move to wealthier cities, that doesn't mean places like San Francisco and New York would necessarily be better off. Large amounts of new housing could destroy the distinctive housing stock that helped make these cities appealing in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most of those regulations aren't just crazy. They're there to maintain a sense of identity that people care about," said Vishaan Chakrabarti, founder of Practice for Architecture &amp; Urbanism, a New York architecture firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York and San Francisco also are partly bounded by water, making it difficult to continue building housing at a rapid clip. Mr. Kennedy, in San Francisco, said he doesn't plan to back down on the courtyard design and plans to continue his fight with the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Planning Department is working with the developer to help them determine a design that will allow for an increased unit count, yet is also compatible with the neighborhood in which it is located," a spokeswoman said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing Starts Fell</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9% in September</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell for the second straight month in September, but builders received more permits, a sign residential construction should pick up in the coming months amid steady demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September's drop in starts was due to an unusually large decline in the volatile multifamily category, but an uptick in permits for multifamily housing indicated the steep fall was likely an aberration. The more stable category of single-family homes posted monthly gains in both permits and starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits issued for privately owned housing units rose 6.3% in September from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.225 million, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Permits for single-family homes, about 60% of all permits, rose to a rate of 739,000, up 0.4% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 9% in September to an annual rate of 1.047 million, as starts on multifamily buildings dropped sharply. But single-family starts continued to climb, rising 8.1% in September to a rate of 783,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September's rise in permits, based on a survey of local governments, had a margin of error of 1.9 percentage points. Last month's decline in starts, based on a survey of builders and homeowners, came with a margin of error of 9.2 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected overall September permits to rise to a 1.17 million annual rate and starts to rebound to a 1.18 million pace. Construction typically begins a month or two after a permit is issued.</p>

The survey collected anecdotal information on economic activity from late August through early October from 12 district banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Outlooks are positive, although contacts in several sectors cite the upcoming presidential election as a source of near-term uncertainty, delaying some business decisions," the Fed's Boston district said in the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The beige book report comes two weeks before Fed officials gather for their Nov. 1-2 meeting. Most economists expect policy makers to hold off on any move until the final month of the year—a Wall Street Journal survey of economists found 81.4% believed the Fed will raise rates at its Dec. 13-14 meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank last increased its benchmark rate in December 2015. Since then, officials have held steady amid slow growth and an uncertain outlook. Three Fed officials voted to raise rates in September, though the majority prevailed against any move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There isn't this tremendous urgency to act on monetary policy right now," New York Fed President William Dudley said last week. "It's not like if we wait a meeting or don't wait a meeting[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/feds-dudley-expects-a-rate-increase-this-year-1476474952] that it has huge consequences for the trajectory of the economy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One factor generating uncertainty: the U.S. presidential election. Americans go to the polls on Nov. 8 to decide between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton. Control of the Senate, and perhaps the House, also is at stake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The beige book report found fairly steady progress across the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Labor market conditions remained tight across most districts," the Fed said. "While reports of labor shortages varied across skill levels and industries, there were multiple mentions of difficulty hiring in manufacturing, hospitality, health care, truck transportation and sales."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wage growth remained modest and price growth mild, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere in the economy, reports were varied, with transportation-related manufacturing a bright spot, consumer spending mixed, real estate activity expanding despite low inventories and rising prices for homes, and commercial and industrial lending increasing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worst appears to be over for the oil and gas sector, which had been punished by a sharp drop in prices. The farm sector, meanwhile, faced mixed fortunes amid high yields but low commodity prices, the Fed said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anna Louie Sussman </div><div>806 words</div><div>19 October 2016</div><div>10:37</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Housing starts fell for the second straight month in September, but builders received more permits, a sign residential construction should pick up in the coming months amid steady demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September's drop in starts was due to an unusually large decline in the volatile multifamily category, but an uptick in permits for multifamily housing indicated the steep fall was likely an aberration. The more stable category of single-family homes posted monthly gains in both permits and starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits issued for privately owned housing units rose 6.3% in September from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.225 million, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Permits for single-family homes, about 60% of all permits, rose to a rate of 739,000, up 0.4% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 9.0% in September to an annual rate of 1.047 million[http://www.census.gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf], as starts on multifamily buildings dropped sharply. But single-family starts continued to climb, rising 8.1% in September to a rate of 783,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Single-family construction is maintaining a steady climb, with permits for single-family structures pointing to continued growth ahead," said Brittany Baumann, macro strategist at TD Securities USA, Inc. She predicted "upward path in single-family home construction" to continue through the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes, about 90% of the housing market, have grown fairly strongly this year, reaching a postrecession peak in June, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Steady job growth, wage gains and low interest rates on mortgages have supported home buying. But low inventory of new and existing homes is driving up prices, putting a purchase out of reach of some would-be buyers. Realtors are looking to home builders to provide much-needed supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite strong demand for housing in many parts of the country, fixed residential investment dropped in the second quarter, dragging on overall U.S. growth. Home builders' sentiment is still running high, coming in at 63 in October, the second-highest level of the year, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> reported earlier this week, but many builders continue to report shortages of lots and labor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That suggests that "supply constraints will remain an inhibiting factor" to a full bounceback in residential construction, according to Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is a mystery that in an environment that sounds like it would be very positive for housing, activity fell in real terms at a nearly 8% annual clip in the second quarter and may have declined at close to a 6% pace in the third quarter," Mr. Stanley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the construction growth this year has been in single-family homes. Through the first nine months of the year, permits were up 0.6% compared with the same period in 2015, while single-family permits were up 8.1%, year to date. Starts were up 3.7% through September, and single-family starts were up an even higher 8.6% through the nine months. Relatively stronger momentum for single-family home construction suggests that builders are responding to rising prices and steady demand for that segment, while construction of larger multifamily projects is slowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both permits and starts fell sharply in the years leading up to the recession, as the housing crisis took hold, and remained near all-time low levels for two years after the recession ended. The construction gauges have rebounded since 2011, but the pace of gains slowed over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly housing figures are often choppy and can be subject to large revisions. August permits were revised up to a 1.152 million rate from 1.139 million. August starts were revised to 1.150 million from 1.142 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September's rise in permits, based on a survey of local governments, had a margin of error of 1.9 percentage points. Last month's decline in starts, based on a survey of builders and homeowners, came with a margin of error of 9.2 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected overall September permits to rise to a 1.17 million annual rate and starts to rebound to a 1.18 million pace. Construction typically begins a month or two after a permit is issued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors group will release data on existing-home sales for September on Thursday. The Commerce Department's September report on new-home sales is due out Oct. 26.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Chris Kirkham   </div><div>1073 words</div><div>19 October 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Europe Edition)</div><div>WSJE</div><div>B9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders sprung back to life after the housing bust by focusing on high-end projects in upscale neighborhoods. One Texas builder is using an aggressive marketing operation to carve out success on the opposite side of the spectrum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">LGI Homes</span>, based in the Houston area, deals almost exclusively in low-price entry-level homes -- often in far-flung suburbs and exurbs. One of its new developments in Howe, Texas, for example, is 56 miles north of downtown Dallas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, <span class="companylink">LGI Homes</span> is forecasting 24% growth in new developments, the fastest rate in the publicly traded U.S. home-building industry and triple the weighted average of all public builders, according to data from John Burns Real Estate Consulting in Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key: LGI's extensive marketing operation. The company sends out 400,000 targeted fliers each week to apartment complexes and other rental units within a 25-mile radius of its new home developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Tired of paying rent?" reads one LGI flier from the Phoenix area. "Own a new home for $799/mo."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LGI also notes in its fliers that its homes may not require a down payment. That is because home buyers may be able to qualify for rural home buyer programs run by the <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Agriculture</span> or loans from the <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To close the deal, LGI instructs prospective buyers to call a toll-free number to set up an appointment for viewing a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They know what they're paying on rent, and if that number on the flier is lower, that's going to open their eyes," said Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Real Estate Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LGI's sales offices operate 359 days a year, from 8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., according to the company. LGI closely tracks the number of calls received from its flier campaigns, how many of those calls result in meetings, how many of those meetings result in contracts and how many contracts lead to closings, said Nishu Sood, a home-building analyst with <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Eric Lipar, LGI's chief executive, said he believes the entry-level market has "the most consistent demand of any of the different product segments."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We believe that most people in the United States, at some point in their career or some point in their life, are going to go from renting to homeownership," he said. "Most of the time that's not based on the economic situation of the world or where oil prices are. It's based on their personal lifestyle decision."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">April McKie was looking to buy a home in the Charlotte, N.C., area earlier this year after she gave birth to a son. A friend referred her to LGI and she was pleased to find out there were homes prebuilt and ready to move in about 20 minutes from her work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The process was pretty easy," she said. "I had my son in April and by the end of May I had already selected the home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers said they have been frustrated with the quality of construction. Jon Rodgers and his wife, Sara, bought a home last year in Rosenberg, Texas, about 35 miles southwest of downtown Houston. Over the past year they said they have had problems with flooding in their yard, which isn't level. A plumber also discovered that contractors building the home had left rags and screws in the pipes, causing their toilet to back up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company paid to replace the carpet and put in a drain in the yard, but it hasn't solved the pooling problem, Mr. Rodgers said, adding that he and his wife are saving up to move elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just about every major home builder deals with customers complaining about construction defects. LGI said in a statement that its homes are "built to the highest quality standards," but it recognizes that "occasionally repairs are needed" within the home's warranty period. The company says it works to provide covered repairs "promptly and to complete satisfaction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One key to LGI's approach is buying cheaper land in more distant suburban locations, where few other builders have ventured so far during the recovery. The average sale price for its homes is $197,450, compared with $362,000 and $290,400 for large builders <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>., respectively, according to the most recent quarterly filings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lipar said the company doesn't "go farther out just to go farther out," and wants to be "as close to jobs, as close to shopping, as close to schools" as other builders. Maintaining affordable price points that are more attractive than renting means going farther out, but he said the company's experience shows buyers are willing to compromise with a slightly longer commute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-founded in 2003 outside Houston by Mr. Lipar, a residential land developer, LGI Homes was among the few large home builders to continue growing during the housing downturn. Some of that owes to its significant presence in Texas, which was less affected by the housing bust than markets such as Arizona or Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since going public in 2013, LGI has nearly quadrupled its revenue and expanded beyond its core market of Texas to other areas such as Charlotte, Nashville, Tenn., Denver and Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home construction remains nearly 30% below historical averages, and most builders have cited the slow return of first-time home buyers as a prime factor. A <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> survey from last year found that the share of first-time buyers was at 32% -- the lowest level since 1987, down from a long-run average of about 39%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year that has started to change, with public builders such as <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> and <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> telling analysts on recent calls that they are seeing a resurgence in demand from this sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But replicating LGI's model would be difficult, analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The first thing I would have to do is spend a lot of money on fliers, and quadruple my staffing levels everywhere," Deutsche's Mr. Sood said. "And then I would have to take a leap of faith on if my sales people are that effective."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Doug Oberhelman spent his first years as Caterpillar Inc.'s chief executive plowing billions of dollars into factories to build more of its familiar yellow machines and move the company deeper into mining equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a bold bet, spectacularly mistimed. On Monday, Mr. Oberhelman announced plans to step down[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/caterpillar-ceo-to-retire-in-march-1476709599] as chief executive by year's end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, when he took charge, the world was gripped by a global commodities boom, along with strong postrecession demand from developing markets and the energy industry. The world was ordering excavators and bulldozers and giant dump trucks at a rapid clip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Oberhelman bet he could grab an outsize share if he could just make more equipment. He spent almost $10 billion world-wide on plants and equipment from 2010 through 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of that went toward building more of its flagship CAT construction machinery. It also paid $8.8 billion in 2011 for Bucyrus International Inc[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB10001424052748703326204575616223898424894]., a Milwaukee mining-equipment maker, to gain a position in giant open-pit-mining shovels and underground-mining machines <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> didn't make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In China, <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> was "going to play offense and we're going to win," Mr. Oberhelman proclaimed in 2010[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB10001424052748704476104575439380471438718]. It had missed opportunities in China before. From 2011 to 2014, <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> roughly doubled its number of plants and facilities there to 26.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everybody was convinced that this time would be different," said Ken Banks, who retired in 2013 as manager for Caterpillar's electric mining shovels. "They thought the Chinese market was so hot, that commodity prices would continue to be very strong and <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> would increase sales substantially."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> said Monday that Mr. Oberhelman would be succeeded as chief executive by Jim Umpleby, a company group president and 35-year veteran. <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> chiefs by tradition haven't stayed beyond age 65, which suggests Mr. Oberhelman is leaving ahead of schedule. Mr. Oberhelman will remain as executive chairman of Caterpillar until March 31, when he will retire from the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year 2012 would prove to be a peak for <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span>. Soon after, miners began shelving equipment-buying plans as commodity prices fell. China's growth slowed. Then oil prices fell[http://topics.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/subject/O/oil/3428], along with demand for related equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> now faces its fourth straight year of falling sales, the longest decline in its history. Its stock is up 29% this year—the best-performing in the Dow Jones Industrial Average—but trades 25% below its 2012 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everybody was surprised by the size of the downturn and the length of it," Mr. Oberhelman, 63 years old, said at a September mining trade show in Las Vegas. "I firmly believe we couldn't have forecast that at the time" of the Bucyrus deal. The company declined to make Mr. Oberhelman available for comment for this article.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slumps are common in <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span>'s world, and rivals are suffering, too. <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span>, though, has long been a flagship American firm, a reliable blue chip in the Dow industrials and a major job creator with plants around the world. Now, it has fallen behind in the slow-growing economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> has reduced its workforce 20% in the past four years, about 30,000 jobs, and has said it expected to close or consolidate as many as 20 plants[https://www-google-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj63rjy8cTPAhXEKyYKHXqlAbsQFggrMAM&amp;url=http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/caterpillar-cuts-jobs-revenue-outlook-1443100742&amp;usg=AFQjCNHB_lVNL2uWg4PbsCbtFhxFu3STMw&amp;sig2=OhfkS78RBPBa0wGuHQGWWg]. In China, <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> said, it has closed one plant and is operating many others at low production rates. <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> in August said it would sell off some of the mining-equipment lines[https://www-google-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjin9n39sTPAhUD4CYKHdWzCv0QFggcMAA&amp;url=http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/caterpillar-plans-to-sell-underground-mining-equipment-lines-1471561600&amp;usg=AFQjCNHdZ54RBPuZ7ehR5g1xezFiD67ebA&amp;sig2=PtT9wUeqrAf1xHvYX2f1cQ&amp;bvm=bv.134495766,d.eWE] it gained with the Bucyrus acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its stock, up 46%from the beginning of Mr. Oberhelman's tenure, trails the S&amp;P 500 index's 107% rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They overlooked the possibility that the whole market would collapse," said Charles Yengst, a Connecticut equipment consultant. "They opened factories all over the place to operate at a market peak that doesn't happen every year or even every 10 or 15 years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> is still the world's largest seller of construction and mining equipment and continues to gain market share, especially in China. The Peoria, Ill., company has posted annual profits throughout Mr. Oberhelman's CEO tenure. "In what is likely to be our fourth down year for sales and revenues, we're proud of what we're accomplishing," Mr. Oberhelman said in a July release, adding that "our machine market position has increased, including in China, product quality continues to be at high levels, and the safety in our facilities is world class."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caterpillar spokeswoman Amy Campbell said <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> expects to handle the next upturn with a more-nimble manufacturing operation. "We're lowering our cost structure," she said. "The company has learned a lot of lessons on how you drive more capacity without spending on capex."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The possibility of a market collapse was almost unthinkable when Mr. Oberhelman, who joined <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> in 1975, became CEO in July 2010. The northeast-Illinois native, whose father was a Deere &amp; Co. salesman, had been chief financial officer in the 1990s and developed a cost-reduction contingency plan credited with helping <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> navigate the last recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Doug had been in the succession pipeline for a number of years," said Gail Fosler, a Caterpillar director who left the board in 2010. "The board felt he would bring a performance discipline to the company that it really needed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expansion strategy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His strategy was to expand <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span>'s dominance into the developing world. In particular, he set sights on markets such as Brazil and China where mining and infrastructure construction were running full tilt. Meanwhile, strong crude prices were driving sales of oil-field-related equipment, especially in North America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Oberhelman voiced determination to avoid production-capacity constraints that had clipped <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span>'s sales growth before the recession. He increased production of the equipment that contractors use to construct buildings and roads and pipelines—<span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span>'s forte—in existing plants. <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> built new factories such as one in Victoria, Texas, to produce some excavator models and another near Athens, Ga., for small dozers—machines it previously made overseas and imported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mining companies were telling <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> they wanted to buy more of their equipment from one source. <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> already made some mining machinery, such as the giant dump trucks strip mines and quarries use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To produce more trucks at its Decatur, Ill., plant, <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> used a tack it repeated during the boom: It narrowed the plant's assembly lineup by relocating some other work to new, smaller plants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The approach would come to hurt the Decatur plant's workforce, but during the mining boom it allowed <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> to pledge a 30% increase in mining-truck production capacity. The company also planned to double production capacity in East Peoria, Ill., for large bulldozers it mainly exported to mining customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> still needed in its catalog were the gargantuan shovels used in open-pit mines and rock-shearing machines for underground mining, among other pieces of mining machinery. Rather than building capacity in-house, as it traditionally did, <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> agreed to buy Bucyrus, the largest deal in the company's history. <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> thus secured a line of shovels, underground-mining equipment and large assembly plants in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In less than six months on the job, Mr. Oberhelman had turned <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> into a full-line mining-equipment player.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In China, Mr. Oberhelman went on an investing spree. In 2008, <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> had bought Chinese construction-equipment concern SEM, gaining a local brand to sell in lower price ranges; it now invested to expand the brand. It expanded existing factories and built new plants to produce more machines and engines, and Bucyrus made <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> a stronger competitor there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It acquired <span class="companylink">ERA Mining Machinery Ltd</span>. in Zhengzhou for nearly $700 million, which sold hydraulic roof supports for mechanized underground coal-mining systems. Months after the 2012 deal closed, <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> said, it discovered ERA had inaccuracies in reported profit, revenue and inventory. <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> eventually wrote down ERA's value by $580 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Oberhelman's strategy still looked like a winner. <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> reported profit of $5.68 billion in 2012, nearly 60% above 2008 results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the peak</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year 2012 would prove to be the high point. Afterward, prices for mined and other commodities began to fall. China's GDP growth waned, and equipment sales slowed around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market weakened in 2013 as developing countries cut construction and consumed fewer commodities. <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span>'s machinery and engine sales fell 16% in 2013 from 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2014, oil prices began falling. <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> sales fell 15% in 2015 as fracking drillers deployed less equipment. U.S. coal mining fell as pollution regulations and cheap natural gas reduced the generation of coal-produced electricity. <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> continued layoffs and in September 2015 said it would make permanent job cuts that could exceed 10,000 positions through 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rivals were hurt, too. Mining-equipment maker <span class="companylink">Joy Global Inc</span>. of Milwaukee expects revenue of about $2.4 billion for its current fiscal year, down from $5.6 billion in 2012. Japan's <span class="companylink">Komatsu Ltd</span>., which in July agreed to acquire Joy, said it expects a 5% to 10% drop in demand for its construction equipment in its current fiscal year and a 15% to 20% decrease in its mining business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A significant sign of strategic retreat was <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span>'s August announcement that it would sell some underground-mining equipment lines that serve markets Mr. Oberhelman had aimed to expand in by acquiring Bucyrus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The amount of investment it would take to make that business successful we thought was better placed elsewhere in our product portfolio," said Denise Johnson, president of the mining-equipment group, at the Las Vegas trade show. "We have to make choices in this environment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its Decatur, Ill., plant, <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span>'s mining emphasis has cost jobs. To focus on the giant trucks, <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> moved away assembly of some other products including graders, used in road building, which it shifted to a new plant in North Little Rock, Ark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Decatur didn't have those lines to fall back on, as it had in many past downturns, when big-truck orders waned. "Graders kept the lights on for a lot of years," said Craig Karnes, president of the United Auto Workers Union Local 751. "When we lost them, it hurt us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer than 600 mining and other off-highway dump trucks left the Decatur plant last year, down 78% from the plant's 2011 peak, according to market-research firm Power Systems Research, which forecasts 543 trucks this year. Decatur's production workforce has fallen to about 800 workers, the lowest in more than 50 years and a third of 2012 levels, Mr. Karnes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> confirmed the plant's volume and production workforce have declined, but had no comment on the research firm's or the union's calculations. The company plans to send some powertrain-assembly work back to Decatur that it moved to a new plant in Winston-Salem, N.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charlotte Opalka was laid off April 2015. "I like building those big mining trucks," said Ms. Opalka, 45, who assembled hoods and cowls. Each month without work puts more strain on her family. "It took our pay and cut it in half," said Ms. Opalka, whose three small grandchildren live with her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> has enough production capacity to benefit from the next upturn, industry analysts say. And investors have shown renewed confidence in <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span>, which has remained profitable by slashing expenses, driving its stock price up in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. construction-machinery sales, though, are being held down by a slow-growing economy and persistent inventories of used fracking-related equipment. In the mining-equipment market, sales droughts typically last seven or eight years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> said it expects overall revenue—including sales and revenue from its finance business—of about $40 billion this year, down 39% from 2012, and profit of $2.75 a share after restructuring expenses, down 68%. Through the first six months of 2016, <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span>'s overall revenue was $19.8 billion, down 21% from the same period in 2015; profit dropped 60% to $821 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Oberhelman now won't likely be at the helm when fortunes turn. He recently warned that any recovery probably wouldn't start this year. Still, he said at the Las Vegas show, "When the industry emerges, we'll be a very key player and a very solid performer for our customers."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In China's leveraged housing market, it isn't the size of the debt but its speed that matters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeking to quell worries that China's home-finance market has gotten out of hand, a banking regulator disclosed this week that the loan-to-value ratio in the housing market, or the ratio of the value of mortgage loans to the value of underlying property, was on average 55%. This isn't a figure the government regularly cites, so it is worth examining whether such a level is really safe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As first glance, this could seem like a comforting metric. It means the average mortgage has 45% of equity standing behind it. So if property values plummet, borrowers wouldn't immediately be underwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the absolute level may not matter as much as the pace of increase. <span class="companylink">UBS</span> estimates the loan-to-value ratio of new-home purchases is even higher, closer to 70%, having surged from 15% in 2012. Much of that rise has happened in the past year. On the banking side, mortgages accounted for more than 70% of all new lending in recent months, up from an average 33% last year. That has sent property and land prices through the roof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a comparison, U.S. mortgages before the housing bubble burst had a loan-to-value ratio of less than 60%, even if this figure obscured second mortgages and lines of credit. In any event, that basic number very quickly rose to over 90% when the bubble popped and prices dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because so many of China's mortgages are of recent vintage, the value side of their loan-to-value calculation rests on the most recent surge in prices. Simplistically, should prices correct, say, 20%, LTVs would suddenly on average be at 70%. That doesn't take into account individual markets where leverage and price increases might be higher. Nor does it factor in the vast market for shadow lending, which anecdotally has been helping buyers fund down payments, heaping leverage on top of leverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite playing down the problems, regulators are also showing signals they understand that such a boom in residential debt needs to be curbed. Restrictions on mortgages have spread in specific markets. More curbs, perhaps aimed at the banks, seem likely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble is, the surging sales and price gains are closely tied to the wider availability of mortgages. Any signs of a drop in value and those loan-to-value ratios don't look so sturdy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have a way of overcorrecting.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's Housing Problem Highlights Regulators' Oversight in Monitoring Risk</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's bubbling housing market is a sign of Beijing's most recent failure to deal with emerging financial risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In developed countries, financial watchdogs generally work to ensure that their institutions become more conservative. Market mechanisms decide which parts of the economy are funded, with banks lending to borrowers they consider creditworthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in China, financial authorities—from the <span class="companylink">People's Bank of China</span> and the <span class="companylink">China Banking Regulatory Commission</span>, down to the local governments—have another role. They are tasked with ensuring Beijing's aims, usually by directing the flow of money to spur economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, a bubble formed on the domestic stock market, fueled in part by authorities' belated response to the buildup of leverage, via loans from brokerages. That story ended badly. The unwinding of debt exacerbated the market's declines, wiping away trillions of U.S. dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, Chinese authorities have been trying to direct credit to the property market, a key driver of top-line growth.They have loosened down-payment restrictions[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-02/02/c_135069057.htm] since late 2015 as a way to address the market's supply glut, the result of booming construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, maintaining a robust property market[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/china-sees-new-challenges-in-mortgage-surge-1476334558] is more important than ever. Leaders are targeting GDP growth of at least 6.5%. Beijing has also been trying to shift the country's debt burdens to households, as worries grow about the ability of companies in shouldering their debt loads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With housing prices soaring out of control, authorities appear again to have been too lax. They now face huge challenges in reining back the flood of money, especially in major coastal cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgages, developer loans and other property-financing streams accounted for 69% of total social financing in China during the second quarter of 2016, according to <span class="companylink">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span>. In the first quarter of 2014, funds going to property made up only 22% of this broad measure of credit, which also includes bank loans and nonbank lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roughly 30% of credit to the sector has come from nonbanks, such as trusts, wealth-management products and other shadow-bank channels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The ability of the authorities to control how money flows is more of a challenge today than it was in the past," said Mark Young, managing director of Asia-Pacific financial institutions at <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>. "There's more credit available through the shadow-banking system which can't be controlled."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities across the country have imposed further restrictions[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chinese-cities-restrict-home-purchases-to-cool-buying-frenzy-1475821594] in recent weeks, like requiring higher down payments and preventing people who already own real estate from buying more. Ideally, authorities would like to forcefully rein in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen but keep the funding taps open in smaller metropolises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the short term it works, but the incentive for local governments to hold their tightening is weak," said David Cui, strategist at <span class="companylink">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span>. Local governments will face decreased incomes from land sales and taxes, he explains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices have largely risen since the late 1990s, building up the perception that authorities will never let the market collapse. By now, "people believe in implicit guarantees," Mr. Cui said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the transcript of a private talk she gave three years ago to <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>., she sounds more sympathetic to the views of the regulatory critics, suggesting that the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul act has stifled lending, a point Mr. Trump has made.</p>

Many of them are already engineering ways to keep it to a nibble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting Christmas Eve, the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul will require companies that package most types of loans into bonds to keep at least 5% of the securities they create.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shaky Ground in China Housing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In China's leveraged housing market, it isn't the size of the debt but its speed that matters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeking to quell worries that China's home-finance market has gotten out of hand, a banking regulator disclosed last week that the loan-to-value ratio in the housing market, or the ratio of the value of mortgage loans to the value of underlying property, was on average 55%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This isn't a figure the government regularly cites, so it is worth examining whether such a level is really safe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As first glance, this could seem like a comforting metric. It means that the average mortgage has 45% of equity standing behind it. So if property values plummet, borrowers wouldn't immediately be underwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the absolute level may not matter as much as the pace of increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">UBS</span> estimates that the loan-to-value ratio of new-home purchases is even higher, closer to 70%, having surged from 15% in 2012. Much of that rise has happened in the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the banking side, mortgages accounted for more than 70% of all new lending in recent months, up from an average 33% last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That surge has sent property and land prices through the roof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a comparison, U.S. mortgages before the housing bubble burst had a loan-to-value ratio of less than 60%, even if this figure obscured second mortgages and lines of credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any event, that basic number very quickly rose to more than 90% when the bubble popped and prices dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because so many of China's mortgages are of recent vintage, the value side of their loan-to-value calculation rests on the most recent surge in prices. Simplistically, should prices correct by, say, 20%, LTVs would suddenly on average be at 70%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't take into account individual markets where leverage and price increases might be higher. Nor does it factor in the vast market for shadow lending, which anecdotal evidence indicates has been helping buyers to fund down payments, heaping leverage on top of leverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite playing down the problems, regulators are also showing signals they understand that such a boom in residential debt needs to be curbed. Restrictions on mortgages have spread in certain specific markets. More curbs, perhaps aimed at the banks, seem likely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble is, the surging sales and price gains are closely tied to the wider availability of mortgages. Any signs of a decline in value and those loan-to-value ratios wouldn't look so sturdy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have a way of overcorrecting.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deutsche Bank Needs Friends to Keep Capital on Track</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no doubt <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>'s best friend right now is the Qatari royal family, so the German lender needs to treat it well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Funds controlled by the Qataris lifted their stake to almost 10% in <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> in July and nominated one of its board members. For now, they support the management of John Cryan, chief executive, and Paul Achleitner, the chairman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they are concerned about the threat posed by legal fines and whether the bank is focused on its long-term strategy, according to The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> can't easily deliver solutions to those problems, but it must keep the Qataris on its side. Their support will be crucial when the bank comes to raise more equity, which seems almost certain to happen in the next two years particularly as German Chancellor Angela Merkel
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">seems to have ruled out state aid for the lender. The bank doesn't have enough capital to deal with fines and restructuring costs and then hit its regulatory minimums in 2019 because chronically poor profitability stops it from building capital through retained profits alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Justice</span> hit <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> last month with an initial demand of $14 billion in fines and compensation for mortgage bond misselling. The bank said it wouldn't pay that much, and most observers don't expect it will. However, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> also has to go back to the DOJ at some point to negotiate a penalty for a probe related to Russian equity trading, which might make it wary of fighting too hard today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> needs to cut costs and assets to boost profitability in a world of super-low interest rates and costlier regulatory requirements. These factors have hurt the economics of its businesses, especially its investment bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> could cut staff far more quickly, but that would very likely slash its revenues. At the same time, it is very hard for any investment bank of <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>'s size to cut assets quickly without fire-sale losses. Furthermore, while a bank still has assets, it needs accountants, risk and compliance people on staff to look after them as they run off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is like turning off a nuclear power station you stop selling electricity, but you face years of huge costs to close the thing down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no quick routes to restoring profitability, but <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> needs to show the Qataris and other investors that it is on an improving track soon or it will struggle ever to get the capital it needs. The <span class="companylink">German government</span> won't help.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most companies, the days of state-sponsored Chinese growth ended a few years ago. Not so <span class="companylink">Volkswagen</span>, but the expiration date is looming now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world's largest car market has long been the most important source of profits for <span class="companylink">Volkswagen</span> passenger cars, the embattled unit within <span class="companylink">Volkswagen Group</span> that makes the eponymous brand. Since last year's diesel crisis, it also has become their key source of growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September sales figures released Friday showed year-to-date growth of 0.6% in the number of VW-branded cars sold world-wide the first positive figure this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Volkswagen</span>'s brand is recovering from the diesel crisis, albeit very slowly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. sales were down 7.8% year over year in September, better than in previous months, and growth in Europe turned very modestly positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But an acceleration in China, which has never bought many diesel cars and paid little attention to VW's fiddling of U.S. emissions tests, is a far more powerful driver of the company's turnaround. VW sales in the country rose 23% to 288,800 for September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outsize importance of China to VW is worrying, given the uncertain growth in the country. After a dismal summer in 2015, the government cut the sales tax on cars. The measure was wildly successful, but comes to an end this December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese medicine has worked wonders on VW, but the effect will soon wear off. Detoxifying the brand in Europe and the U.S. remains an urgent priority.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans no longer will have to count their Montecristos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Barack Obama's announcement Friday that the U.S. was further easing trade restrictions on Cuba means that even more of the Caribbean island's storied cigars will become available to yanquis, potentially denting their cachet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past couple of years, an American visiting Cuba could bring back $100 worth of stogies on an official trip to Cuba.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cigar Aficionado reported in 2015 that $100, exchanged into convertible pesos, would be enough to buy only a box of 10 Montecristo Double Edmundos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That made a Cuban cigar in America a hot item indeed, though perhaps not as hot as John F. Kennedy's stash of 1,200 cigars purchased the night before he signed a trade embargo that was to last 52 years.</p>

<span class="companylink">SoftBank</span>'s $100 Billion Elephant Gun Packs a Scare</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan's richest man delayed his retirement to work on a few crazy ideas. Now those ideas are taking shape and could indeed be nerve-racking for investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SoftBank</span>, controlled by billionaire Masayoshi Son, said Friday it will form a fund with up to $100 billion to invest in technology companies. Saudi Arabia's public investment fund will put in as much as $45 billion over the next five years with some other "large global investors" also interested in chipping in. SoftBank itself would put in at least $25 billion and could apparently call the shots with its "investment proficiency, operational expertise and breadth of experience."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To put this into context, companies backed by venture capital raised a total of $130.9 billion last year globally, according to a report by <span class="companylink">KPMG</span> and CB Insights. A $100 billion fund would be able to buy all of <span class="companylink">Salesforce.com</span>, <span class="companylink">LinkedIn</span>, <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, <span class="companylink">GoPro</span> and Fitbit and still have a few billion left over. <span class="companylink">SoftBank</span>'s market capitalization is $75 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SoftBank</span> shares rose 3% Friday, reflecting investors' confidence in Mr. Son's investment acumen. In fact, SoftBank itself is kind of a technology fund. It owns a 27% stake in China's e-commerce giant Alibaba, an 83% stake in U.S. telecom operator Sprint and 43% of <span class="companylink">Yahoo Japan</span>. Those investments have done well this year. <span class="companylink">Sprint</span> has more than doubled from January lows. Alibaba is up 70% since February. The two stocks have netted SoftBank nearly $30 billion in the past six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet this new investment commitment, together with the $32 billion purchase of U.K. chip designer ARM Holdings completed last month, would add to SoftBank's already high debt load. Excluding <span class="companylink">Sprint</span>'s borrowings, analysts estimate SoftBank has net debt of around 7 trillion yen to 8.3 trillion yen ($67 billion to $80 billion). <span class="companylink">Sprint</span> seems to have turned a corner recently, but if things start to look bad again, SoftBank may have to divert more resources to the indebted telecom operator. <span class="companylink">SoftBank</span> has already provided funding to <span class="companylink">Sprint</span> by buying its assets and leasing them back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or SoftBank could cash out some of its existing investments. It pocketed some handsome profits earlier this year by trimming its Alibaba stake. More could be coming.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WELLINGTON—New Zealand home prices rose in September but sales were weaker, data from the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand showed Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The REINZ said the national median home price in September was NZ$515,000 ($364,194), up 4.7% from the previous month, and 6.3% higher from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales totaled 7,397 nationally in September down 2% from the prior month, and down 10% from the same month a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices outside Auckland hit a record median high of NZ$400,000 in September, it said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The real-estate market in New Zealand appears to be in something of a two-speed mode at present, with Auckland pausing for breath during a wet school holiday period and ahead of likely new Spring growth," said Bryan Thomson, a spokesperson for REINZ.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Art Patnaude </div><div>580 words</div><div>7 October 2016</div><div>10:05</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In London's priciest neighborhoods[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/london-luxury-house-prices-keep-falling-after-brexit-vote-1470229733], renting is on the rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate broker Knight Frank signed a record number of prime central London rental agreements in September, Tom Bill, the firm's head of residential research, said on Friday. Knight Frank declined to state the number of leases signed, but Mr. Bill said it was 34% more than in September 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers and sellers have been holding back on luxury London homes because they were uncertain about the direction of prices. Brexit has compounded the issue. With clarity still hard to come by, many are opting to rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rental boom comes after a period of falling home prices in areas around Buckingham Palace and Hyde Park. Prime prices are down 10% from their peak in 2014, according to residential-data provider LonRes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can't deny Brexit has added a layer of uncertainty [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/investors-go-bargain-hunting-for-u-k-property-1468902601]to the market," Mr. Bill said. "But it's by no means a primary driver."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House hunters are facing a higher transaction tax, known as stamp duty, which has significantly slowed high-end sales. Buyers might be willing to pay the stamp duty if a path to rising prices is clear, but uncertainty about price growth abounds, Mr. Bill said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another attractive feature for wealthy tenants: the cost of renting in prime-central London was down 4.7% year-over-year in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop follows a jump in supply. Facing a weaker sales market, would-be sellers are increasingly putting their homes up for rent. The number of new rental properties on the market in August was up 44% from a year earlier, Knight Frank data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the financial crisis, central London mansions and penthouses became one of the hottest global assets for foreign investors looking to take refuge from political and financial instability. But the shifting tax regime, low oil prices, volatile stock markets and an element of sticker shock after years of rising values all hit demand in the past couple of years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there are signs demand could start picking up. And Brexit's behind this, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in sterling [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/computer-driven-hedge-funds-in-focus-after-sterlings-plunge-1475838822]against global currencies after the Brexit vote has increased demand among foreign buyers, property brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For buyers with dollars, or currencies pegged to the U.S. currency like those in Hong Kong and Singapore, central London is the most affordable it has been since 2012, two years before prices peaked, a LonRes report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even buyers from continental Europe are getting relative bargains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Exchange rate fluctuations will, we expect, create far greater buying opportunities for prime central London property than changes in prices," the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside of London, the picture is similar: The number of people renting is on the rise, while property prices are cooling due to shrinking demand. U.K. house-prices fell 0.1% in the past three months, mortgage lender Halifax said in its monthly report Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But unlike luxury pads in central London, falling demand is down to stretched affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout the U.K., "a lengthy period where house prices have risen more rapidly than earnings has put pressure on affordability, therefore constraining demand," said Martin Ellis, housing economist at Halifax.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heiress Seeks $200 Million in L.A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After conducting a major renovation, British heiress Petra Stunt is relisting the Spelling Mansion -- the massive Los Angeles home built by late television producer Aaron Spelling -- for $200 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Holmby Hills home is roughly 56,500 square feet, making it one of the largest private homes in Los Angeles, said Rick Hilton of Hilton &amp; Hyland, who is listing the home with colleague David Kramer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On roughly 5 acres, the home has seven bedrooms plus a service wing, Mr. Hilton said. The home's entry has 30-foot-high ceilings and a double staircase. There is a two-lane bowling alley, catering kitchen, gym and a beauty salon with massage and tanning rooms. The roughly 7,000-square-foot master suite has its own kitchen, living room and a two-level closet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside there is a swimming pool, tennis court, formal gardens and a motor court with a fountain and space to park 100 cars, Mr. Hilton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Spelling and his wife, Candy, built the French chateau-style home around 1990. After her husband's death, Ms. Spelling listed the house for $150 million, and it was on the market for about two years before it was purchased in 2011 for $85 million by Ms. Stunt, the daughter of the British billionaire and Formula One racing boss Bernie Ecclestone. Ms. Stunt embarked on an extensive renovation, employing about 500 workers. "She didn't spare any expense in the renovation," Mr. Hilton said, although he declined to specify how much the project cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hilton said Ms. Stunt and her husband, entrepreneur James Stunt, are selling because their children are in school in London and they aren't spending much time in Los Angeles. She bought a home in London's Chelsea neighborhood in 2010 for about $90 million. The Stunts could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a spate of big-ticket sales in the past few months, Los Angeles has seen a number of ultrahigh-end properties go on the market. A Beverly Hills estate once owned by William Randolph Hearst listed in September for $195 million -- up 18% from its last listing price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Lynch Lists Large Scottsdale Retreat</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Lynch, the former mutual-fund manager famed for his investment savvy, said he is likely to see a loss on the sale of his Scottsdale, Ariz., vacation home, which he is putting on the market for $14 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lynch, 72, declined to say how much he spent building the house, but said costs were close to its current asking price. "If we sold for this price, we wouldn't break even," he said, though he added that the property "was never an investment." As it is, the home is one of the most expensive residential properties in Scottsdale, according to according to Jay Pennypacker of Russ Lyon Sotheby's International Realty, who has the listing with colleague Debbie Negrin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjacent to the golf course in the gated community of Estancia, the five-bedroom main house measures about 11,200 square feet, with an elevator and multiple patios, including one off Mr. Lynch's upstairs office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The grounds -- 4 1/2 acres with views of the surrounding mountains -- include a caretaker's cottage and a two-bedroom pool house with a game room. Fed by a three-story rock waterfall, the heated outdoor swimming pool also has a roughly 40-foot-long waterslide. Next to the pool there is a barbecue cabana and an outdoor dining area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lynch, who retired in 1990 after running the <span class="companylink">Fidelity Magellan Fund</span> for 13 years, said he has lived in the Boston area for much of his life, but he and his wife fell in love with Arizona while driving across the state on their honeymoon. To build the home, Mr. Lynch said he bought four vacant home sites in the early 2000s, paying about $4 million. The house was completed in 2005, and the couple planted about 20 different types of cactus on the property, include a rare double-crested saguaro that stands about 25 feet tall, Mr. Lynch said. They later bought another two sites totaling approximately 3 acres across the street to maintain their privacy and views. Those lots aren't listed but could be purchased through a separate negotiation, Mr. Pennypacker said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lynch said his grandchildren are in the Boston area and in California, so he now spends very little time in Arizona. His wife, Carolyn, died last year, and "there's no way I'm going there by myself."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A $20 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home in</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An oceanfront South Florida home is going on the market for $20 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house is in the town of Golden Beach, about 20 miles north of Miami. According to listing agent Janet Ben Zvi of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>, the four-bedroom home measures about 5,000 square feet. The nearly 1-acre lot on Ocean Boulevard also includes a separate garage, a cabana and a swimming pool overlooking the ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built in 1941, the brick house was purchased by cardiovascular surgeon Malcolm Dorman in 1985 for $700,000, according to public records. Dr. Dorman remodeled the house about five years ago, but a new owner could demolish the property and rebuild, Ms. Ben Zvi said. Now largely retired, Dr. Dorman lives in the Palm Beach area, she added.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ryan Dezember   </div><div>667 words</div><div>6 October 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Europe Edition)</div><div>WSJE</div><div>B5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big short is going long on the U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald Mullen Jr., the former Wall Street executive who a decade ago helped oversee <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>.'s lucrative bet against the U.S. housing market, co-founded real-estate investment firm Pretium Partners LLC, which is raising $1 billion to buy single-family homes to rent out to tenants, according to fundraising documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mullen, the onetime head of Goldman's mortgage-and-credit business, is now pitching pensions, endowments and other large investors on a wager that, four years after the housing market hit bottom, rents and home prices will continue to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We believe tight credit availability is preventing new households from being able to obtain mortgages to purchase their first home," <span class="companylink">Pretium</span> wrote in its 69-page pitch to investors. "Households that have been unable to obtain mortgages have become renters, thus driving high occupancy rates and robust rent growth."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through a spokesman, Mr. Mullen and <span class="companylink">Pretium</span> declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the housing crash, the ranks of apartment renters swelled across the U.S., pushing up rents by 20% since 2012. In the second quarter, the U.S. homeownership rate fell to 62.9%, the lowest level since the government began keeping track in 1965.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the housing market has stormed back, with the S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller index of national home prices in July just 0.6% shy of its 2006 peak. It has jumped 37% since its 2012 bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But economists expect the homeownership rate to keep declining over the next decade due to tough lending standards and a younger generation of potential buyers mired in student debt and less compelled to own homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the crash, investors swooped into the housing market, picking up homes in foreclosure auctions and renting them out to tenants. In all, the six largest home buyers have spent more than $28 billion on U.S. houses since the latest peak, according to research firm <span class="companylink">Green Street Advisors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> for a time spent $150 million a week on houses on its way to accumulating about 50,000 properties it manages through its <span class="companylink">Invitation Homes LP</span>. <span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span>, launched in 2012 by self-storage magnate B. Wayne Hughes with cash from Alaska's state oil fund, owns about 48,000 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate moguls Barry Sternlicht and Thomas J. Barrack Jr. merged their rental-home pools earlier this year to create <span class="companylink">Colony Starwood Homes</span>, which said it owned about 31,000 houses as of June 30. Shares of Colony and <span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span> have risen more than 23% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Pretium</span> rents and manages its homes under the name Progress Residential. It is raising money for what would be its third fund dedicated to residential real estate. The first, which raised $1.2 billion in 2012, was used to buy more than 16,500 homes at big discounts. In 2014 it raised $900 million to purchase 14,000 nonperforming home loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Pretium</span>'s third fund, like the first, aims to buy houses and rent them out. But with foreclosures having returned to normal levels, Mr. Mullen and his colleagues will likely be buying more properties on the open market and fewer on the courthouse steps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The timing of the effort could be tricky. After a six-year boom, the overall market for rental properties has slowed amid a construction boom in luxury apartments, with apartment rents in some big cities declining in the third quarter, the first quarterly decline since 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But single-family homes continue to show potential. Rents for new leases of single-family homes grew 4.25% in the third quarter of 2016, accelerating from 4.1% a year earlier, according to Green Street, even as the pool of rental homes has grown.</p>

<span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> officials and private economists predicted for months that U.S. economic output would rebound strongly in the third quarter after dismal first half growth. That rebound now looks like it didn't materialize.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes in the U.S. that went under contract fell in August to the lowest level since January, the latest sign the housing market lost momentum in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index of pending home sales, reflecting tentative purchases of previously owned homes, fell 2.4% in August to a reading of 108.5, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected sales to be flat in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales offer an early peek at the direction of the housing market because they measure sales at the time a contract is signed, but before "closing," or when it becomes final. The closing process typically takes weeks or months, and many contracts are canceled for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales have fallen for three of the past four months. Over the past year, pending sales have decreased 0.2%. The figures mimic other reports suggesting Americans are reducing purchases of home sales after a surge in buying earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most closely watched measure of housing—the Realtors group's monthly report on existing home sales—showed that home sales have fallen for two consecutive months[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/existing-home-sales-fall-for-second-straight-month-1474553092]. Sales of existing homes, as opposed to newly built homes, reflect roughly 90% of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Earlier this summer[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-climb-to-strongest-pace-in-nearly-a-decade-1469110085], existing-home sales, which measure purchases once they are final, reached the highest level since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist, attributed the dip in sales to a run-up in prices in recent years and shortage of for-sale homes. Many prospective buyers today are now unable to afford to buy or aren't happy with the few options available on the market, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Contract activity slackened throughout the country in August except for in the Northeast, where higher inventory totals are giving home shoppers greater options and better success signing a contract," Mr. Yun said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the latest weakness, the housing market remains solid overall. And the ingredients for steady growth—persistently low mortgage rates and strong job growth—remain in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's report showed sales rose in the Northeast in August from July but declined in the West, Midwest and South.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the 10,000 people who evacuated from low-lying areas have started to move back, Mr. Buelow said. He said the city is coming up with a plan to reduce the voluntary evacuation zone as water levels recede.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are nearing their precrisis peak in 2006—good news for homeowners. But price increases have led to a slowdown in the volume of home sales because it is making it difficult for new buyers to enter the market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported that home sales fell for the second straight month[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/existing-home-sales-fall-for-second-straight-month-1474553092], as rising prices have made it increasingly difficult for new buyers to purchase homes. Sales of previously owned homes fell 0.9% from a month earlier to an annual rate of 5.33 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hottest markets in the country have shifted away from California and toward the northeast, as many buyers priced out of the Silicon Valley area flee to secondary tech hubs. Portland reported a 12.4% year-over-year gain, Seattle showed growth of 11.2%, and Denver had a 9.4% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-over-month prices the U.S. Index rose 0.7% in July before seasonal adjustment, while the 10-city index rose 0.5% and the 20-city index increased 0.6% from June to July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After seasonal adjustment, the national index rose 0.4% month-over-month, the 10-city decreased 0.1% and the 20-City index remained unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national index is now within 0.6% of the record high set a decade ago in July 2006, but Mr. Blitzer said there is little danger of a bubble given that mortgage debt remains low. Currently, outstanding mortgage debt on one-to-four family homes is 12.6% below the peak seen in the first quarter of 2008 and up less than 2% in the last four quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is no reason to fear that another massive collapse is around the corner," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes pulled back in August after surging the prior month, though the broader trend showed solid momentum in the market for single-family houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of new, single-family homes declined 7.6% in August from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 609,000, the Commerce Department said Monday. It was the largest one-month drop since September 2015. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected sales would fall 8% to a 602,000 pace in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July sales were revised up to a 659,000 rate from an earlier estimate of 654,000, a jump of 13.8% from June to the strongest monthly sales pace since October 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More broadly, through the first eight months of 2016, new-home sales were up 13.3% compared with the same period in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market has appeared to slow in recent months, despite low borrowing costs. Existing-home sales slipped in August for the second straight month, squeezed by tight inventory and high prices, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Also, residential building permits and housing starts fell in August, the Commerce Department said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Bill Cary   </div><div>1102 words</div><div>24 September 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A16</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With their three children in their 20s and a new condominium complex going up in downtown Bronxville, Richard and Marcella Dresdale decided it was the perfect time to downsize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They put their five-bedroom Tudor on the market and bought a two-bedroom apartment in the complex, called VillaBXV. Their move, planned for next summer, will bring them into the heart of this well-to-do, tightknit Westchester County community of 6,500 that they have grown to love in the 25 years since they came from Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For us, it's a great opportunity -- to be a block, two blocks from everything," said Mr. Dresdale, a private-equity investor who still commutes the 15 miles into Midtown a few times a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What's great about Bronxville is that you can come here, even for people from other countries, and immediately be welcomed into the community and have a network in place," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roots of Bronxville itself are deep. A prosperous farming community in the 18th century, it was incorporated as a village within the town of Eastchester in 1898.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of Bronxville's grand homes, on winding streets with stately trees, were built roughly a century ago when the village was home to an artists' colony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Bronxville has several sites on the National Register of Historic Places, including the post office, the Bronxville Women's Club and the Lawrence Park Historic District.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The village is having a really nice resurgence," said Mayor Mary Marvin, noting that there are few empty storefronts. "It's a really special place. The intangibles are amazing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of its excellent school system, proximity to New York City and its rich mix of historic housing stock, Bronxville has a strong real-estate market, even in lean times, said Sheila Stoltz, an agent with Houlihan Lawrence who has lived in the village for 15 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Remarkably, it always does well," said Ms. Stoltz. "Even in 2008 and '09, we were down, but we were so much better than Connecticut and elsewhere."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The square-mile vibrant downtown business district and easy walkability add to its allure, Ms. Stoltz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everyone who comes from the city wants to walk and be close to everything," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most Bronxville residents live in either single-family homes or cooperatives. The village also has a small number of townhouses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like demand, housing prices have stayed high. For the first half of this year, the median price for a single-family home was $2.3 million, with 22 closed sales, compared with $2.7 million, with 19 closings, for the same period last year, according to the Hudson Gateway Multiple Listing Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But 2015 was an outlier because we had two houses that sold for $8.5 million," Ms. Stoltz said of the higher median price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for a townhouse was $940,000, compared with $990,000, according to Hudson Gateway. For co-ops, the median price for the same six-month periods was $465,000 for 2016 and $550,000 for 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VillaBXV is the first new housing development in many years, said the mayor, Ms. Marvin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's keeping some wonderful people in Bronxville, longtime involved residents who didn't want to leave," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condo complex is also drawing residents from New York City and other Westchester communities, including Dru Richards, a resident of Manhattan's Upper East Side for more than 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think of Bronxville as urban-suburban -- there's a sophistication about it," Ms. Richards said. "I'm thinking of it as another neighborhood of New York City."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transportation: The commute to Grand Central Terminal takes about a half-hour on Metro-North's Harlem line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schools: All public-school students, from kindergartners to seniors, attend classes in what is known as the Bronxville School, a brick building on Pondfield Road. The participation rate in Advanced Placement courses at Bronxville High School is 80%; math proficiency is 81% and English proficiency is 98%, according to <span class="companylink">U.S. News &amp; World Report</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dining: The Bronxville Diner, which opened in August, serves classic American fare. Underhills Crossing dishes up new American cuisine with a French flair. Sammy's Downtown Bistro &amp; Bar focuses on continental and American fare. Slave to the Grind is a retro coffeehouse. For international flavors: Blue Moon Mexican Cafe and Rosie's Bistro Italiano.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entertainment: The three-screen Bow Tie Bronxville Theater shows first-run films. Both Concordia College, which is in the village, and Sarah Lawrence College, just over the border in Yonkers, have theater, music and lecture series.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The photo of Big E Farm was provided by the Corcoran Group. An earlier version of this article had an incorrect photo credit. (Sept. 21, 2016)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long Island's North Fork has a healthy residential real-estate market right now: Demand is strong, fewer homes are for sale and prices are rising, according to reports from real-estate firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet prices for North Fork wineries and vineyards have been reduced. Would buyers be better off putting their money into the wine business instead?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest and priciest offering is the 200-plus-acre Big E Farm in Riverhead, N.Y., that includes multiple homes, a former Thoroughbred breeding farm, a large wedding venue and more than 100 acres of vineyards as well as the Martha Clara winery. The property went on the market just over two years ago for $25 million; today, the asking price is $20 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are selling a lifestyle and it's a bonus that the winery is included in the sale," said Sheri Winter Clarry, a broker with <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> and the estate's listing agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The day that Ms. Winter Clarry gave me a tour of the farm was the same day that owner Robert Entenmann, the former chairman of Entenmann baked goods and the founder of Martha Clara winery, had passed away. "I'm feeling a little emotional," Ms. Winter Clarry said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Winter Clarry was upbeat about the farm's many possibilities. "There are so many different options," she said, with a sweep of her hand that took in the farm's extensive vineyards and pastures where horses grazed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purchase price included the horses, Ms. Winter Clarry noted, offering to send me a "full inventory" of the animals that included Thoroughbreds, miniature donkeys and llamas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Winter Clarry has toured the farm with many potential buyers, "from New England to Europe," but the right one hasn't come along yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same holds true of Palmer Vineyards in Aquebogue, N.Y., which has been on the market since 2009, the year its founder, Robert Palmer, passed away. "We're looking for someone with the passion to keep this going," said Kathy LeMorzellec, Mr. Palmer's daughter and the winery's president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Potential buyers from China, India and Japan have all visited the property but are perhaps scared off by the high cost of production and "the labor market in Long Island is a little scary," said Ms. LeMorzellec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The size of the winery (around 11,000 cases) was probably a bit daunting as well. As Ms. LeMorzellec said, "We're not a boutique."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Palmer Vineyards went up for sale, the price was $6.9 million for the winery, main house and 45 planted acres and $4.1 million for 48 planted vineyard acres and 3½ buildable acres in Cutchogue; today, it is $5.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third winery is for sale as well: Osprey's Dominion in Peconic, N.Y., quietly went on the market in September 2014 for $20 million. The price has been reduced to $15 million. The package includes the winery, tasting room, 90 acres of vineyards and other buildings. (The winery's founder, Bud Koehler, told me he preferred not to talk about the sale when I reached him by phone.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are two vineyard options. The first is Southold Farm + Cellar in Southold, N.Y. Owned by Regan and Carey Meador, the restored farm house on 23.5 acres with nine acres of grapes is priced at $1.795 million, down from $1.899 million. The second is a 5,000-square-foot house in Cutchogue with a few acres of Pinot Blanc grapes owned by the principals of the Premium Wine Group; the price is just under $3 million, said the listing agent, Thomas McCloskey, of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>, in Mattituck, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McCloskey said the house itself is nice, but the vineyard acreage is what has generated the greatest interest. In fact, "buyers have inquired about acquiring additional acreage," he said. The purchase, though, wouldn't be a business but a "vanity project," Mr. McCloskey said, adding that "none of the people looking at this property are going to pick their own grapes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps business-minded buyers should look to Big E Farms and Martha Clara, where a thriving wedding business is booked all the way into next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We will sell with the weddings in place," said Ms. Winter Clarry. "So the brides don't have to worry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not to mention all those horses, donkeys and llamas.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Peter Grant </div><div>1059 words</div><div>22 September 2016</div><div>12:03</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-equity giant <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> has cut a deal to pay $1.5 billion for a portfolio of logistics centers, in the latest sign that this e-commerce-driven business is one of the hottest areas in the commercial-property industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blackstone, the world's largest private real-estate owner, has signed a contract to buy the 12 million-square-foot portfolio of mostly West Coast property from <span class="companylink">LBA Realty LLC</span>, an Irvine, Calif.-based investment company with properties in the western U.S., according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once closed, the deal will mark Blackstone's biggest purchase of U.S. distribution centers since it exited from the U.S. logistics business in 2015 by selling <span class="companylink">IndCor Properties</span> for $8.1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Logistics properties typically include warehousing and distribution facilities for moving goods from manufacturers to stores and customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investor demand for such real estate has shown unusual resilience during what many analysts and investors consider to be a late stage of a bull market for commercial property. Prices keep rising even as those in other commercial-real-estate sectors, such as office buildings and malls, have shown signs of cooling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives at logistics companies say their businesses are benefiting from the growing importance of distribution in retail and other industries. Increasingly, business profitability is being determined by the efficiency, speed and costs of moving goods, they say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some businesses, like retailing, are being completely transformed by distribution as consumers migrate online, cutting out the need for bricks-and-mortar stores. Many mall owners have suffered while owners of logistics properties have been the big winner from this trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Distribution used to be just another part of the supply chain," said Charles Sullivan, president of U.S. operations for Global Logistic Properties Ltd., the second-largest owner in the U.S. sector. "Now logistics has moved up in its importance in corporate strategy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big private-equity firms like Blackstone and foreign investors such as Singapore's <span class="companylink">GIC Pte. Ltd</span>. and the <span class="companylink">Abu Dhabi Investment Authority</span> have been among the most recent investors. Meanwhile, other investors such as private-equity giant TPG, LBA and Ross Perot Jr.'s <span class="companylink">Hillwood Development</span> Co. have been responding by putting logistics portfolios on the block. Hillwood sold a $1.1 billion portfolio earlier this month to Singapore-based Global Logistic, whose major shareholders include GIC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stock investors also have been bullish. Big public logistics companies such as <span class="companylink">Prologis Inc</span>. are trading at a premium of about 7% to the value of their properties, according to analysts. Companies that own other properties like malls, office buildings and hotels are trading below asset values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The logistics sector's strength is being fueled by rising demand for space from <span class="companylink">Amazon.com Inc</span>. and other Internet retailers. Rents and occupancy rates are rising beyond the expectations of many analysts and industry participants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net income of real-estate investment trusts that focus on logistics, warehouses and other industrial property is expected to rise 4.8% this year, more than any other property type except apartment buildings and self-storage, according to <span class="companylink">Green Street Advisors LLC</span>. Last year, income in the industrial sector increased 4.5% versus the industry average of 4.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investing now could be particularly risky. An expected surge in new supply in several parts of the country—including the Atlanta and Dallas regions—could weigh on returns, analysts said, while the torrid growth of e-commerce could slow. Because of razor-thin margins and high delivery costs, online retail remains unprofitable or barely profitable for many companies despite its surging popularity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But so far, demand growth from tenants is outpacing new supply, according to analyst Eric Frankel of Green Street. "In some markets there's meaningful new supply, but it's being absorbed very quickly," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investor appetite for logistics property began growing in the early years of the economic recovery and expansion partly because they expected online retail to grow. Also prices were low thanks to the pounding the sector took during the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the economy strengthened, the sector was helped by improvements in the home-building and automotive industries, both heavy users of warehousing and distribution space. In some regions, other factors fueled demand, including marijuana legalization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the Denver market, all the functionally obsolete space got absorbed by the marijuana industry," said Andrew Van Tuyle, chief acquisitions officer of BH Management Inc., which owns about 500,000 square feet in that market. "All of a sudden the vacancy for the overall industrial market became very low."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changes in the online retail business also have fueled demand for logistics space. As Amazon and others began offering faster delivery, they began looking for so-called in-fill properties closer to population centers that were partly designed to process individual packages rather than pallets of goods bound for stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TPG spent about $300 million of equity capital to build a portfolio of about 16 million square feet of in-fill properties starting in 2014, which it named Evergreen Industrial Properties. Earlier this summer, the firm hired Eastdil Secured LLC and <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>. to sell Evergreen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blackstone was one of the early movers of the recovery in the logistics market. It built its IndCor portfolio through about 18 acquisitions, often buying buildings from distressed sellers like the <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> estate. Blackstone cut a deal to sell IndCor to Global Logistic in late 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blackstone made its IndCor investment through one of its "opportunity" funds, which tend to make shorter-term, more highly leveraged bets in pursuit of higher returns. Its purchase of the LBA portfolio is through one of Blackstone's "core-plus" funds that typically uses less leverage and hold investments for longer periods of time, say people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blackstone also owns 150 million square feet of logistics real estate in Europe that it accumulated during the recovery. The firm has been expected to try to sell it soon in an initial public offering but so far hasn't announced its plans.</p>

</div><div>Associated Press</div>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DENVER—Gross mismanagement, delays and lax oversight by the Veterans Affairs Department added hundreds of millions of dollars to the cost of a new Denver-area VA hospital, federal investigators said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report from the department's internal watchdog also said a former senior VA official[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/veterans-affairs-construction-chief-retires-1427321266], Glenn Haggstrom, knew the project was veering toward huge cost overruns but didn't tell lawmakers that when he testified before Congress in 2013 and 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That prompted lawmakers to call for a perjury investigation. Mr. Haggstrom didn't immediately return a telephone message seeking comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hospital, now under construction in suburban Aurora, is expected to cost about $1.7 billion, nearly triple the 2014 estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 184-bed facility is about 70% complete, and construction is expected to be done in January 2018. It will replace an aging, overcrowded facility still in use in Denver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sloan Gibson, deputy secretary of Veterans Affairs, has said that everyone involved in the cost overruns has either retired or was transferred or demoted. No one has been fired or criminally charged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That angers some members of Congress. Rep. Jeff Miller, chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, said Wednesday he will ask the Justice Department to look into perjury charges against Mr. Haggstrom and others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To this day, the department's handling of the replacement Denver VA medical center continues to be a case study in government waste, incompetence and secrecy," said Mr. Miller (R., Fla.).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rep. Mike Coffman (R., Colo.) had asked the inspector general to consider recommending a criminal investigation if warranted, but the report didn't address that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Coffman said he was frustrated and disappointed and would ask the inspector general again to consider recommending a criminal investigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm trying to get to the bottom of this. And I think quite frankly the Veterans Affairs (Department) doesn't seem to care," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This was an internal investigation and I think it was compromised" because it ignored possible criminal conduct, Mr. Coffman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inspector general's report repeated some conclusions from earlier investigations[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/colorado-va-hospital-construction-is-more-than-1-billion-over-budget-1426636241] but is the most scathing account of the project to date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It accused senior VA leaders of making poor business decisions, allowing architects to include lavish and unnecessary design features and delaying decisions on construction changes by up to three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inspector general accused the VA of "gross mismanagement" for assigning far too few engineers and project managers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gibson said the department has taken responsibility for the problems and has made changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two weeks ago, Mr. Miller's committee subpoenaed documents on a separate internal VA investigation into the cost overruns. The department hasn't said whether it would comply with the subpoena.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The VA has said making the documents public could have a chilling effect on future internal investigations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The subpoena also seeks documents related to millions of dollars spent on artwork and ornamental furnishings at VA offices nationwide, including more than $6.4 million spent on the Palo Alto, Calif., health-care system.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Donna Borak </div><div>550 words</div><div>21 September 2016</div><div>19:16</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said policy makers are closely watching for signs of overheating in the commercial real-estate market, given the swift rise in property prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are worried that bubbles could form in the economy and we routinely monitor asset valuations," said Ms. Yellen in her press conference following a two-day meeting of the central bank's monetary policy committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added, however, that the central bank isn't ready to declare the sector overheated, saying: "Nobody can know for sure what kind of valuation represents a bubble—that's only something one can tell in hindsight."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Yellen said the issue was raised as policy makers met to discuss whether to lift short-term interest rates during their September meeting. The central bank agreed Wednesday to keep rates unchanged[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-stands-pat-but-says-case-for-rate-increase-has-strengthened-1474481243], while signaling plans to raise them before year-end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unclear how, if at all, the Fed would respond even if it did feel it needed to rein in property prices. One blunt response would be to raise rates, which would make it more expensive for real-estate investors to borrow, but would also likely damp economic growth over all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, regulators, including Ms. Yellen, have emphasized moving to make the financial system more resilient against unexpected risks. She has in recent years pointed to tools available to regulators such as running "stress tests" for banks, as well as plans to implement a so-called countercyclical buffer that forces banks to hold additional capital to guard against frothy lending. The Fed chairwoman didn't specify how the central bank might address a real estate bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Yellen said one possible sign of overheating was that property prices seemed "high" relative to rental costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low interest rates and a flood of cash pumped into economies by central banks have made commercial real estate look attractive compared with bonds and other assets. By keeping interest rates low, central banks around the world have pushed investors to seek returns from a broad range of riskier assets, such as high-yield, or "junk," bonds and real estate. The surging demand for commercial property has drawn comparisons to the mid-2000s boom, which burst amid the financial crisis, crushing many developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This isn't the first time regulators have signaled concern about the sector in recent months. In December, officials signaled to bankers they were preparing to crack down on risky commercial real-estate lending, threatening to force banks to hold more capital against those loans[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-banking-regulators-step-up-rhetoric-on-commercial-real-estate-loans-1450452802] as they scrutinize lending practices this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers are worried there are signs that lending standards have weakened, a common pattern for the volatile sector. When values are low, lenders are wary and credit is tight. But as values rise, lenders are more eager to lend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed chair said Wednesday that bank supervisors have provided guidance to banks to beef up their underwriting standards. It is also an area the Fed is examining as part of yearly stress tests of the country's largest banks to ensure they are holding sufficient capital to buffer against any potential losses.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer building permits were issued in the U.S. last month, and housing starts slumped, but underlying data suggests there is modest momentum for single-family home building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits issued for privately owned housing units fell 0.4% in August from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual level of 1,139,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.

Lennar, KB Home Profits Top Estimates Amid Housing Recovery; Home builder posts another quarter boosted by gains in key metrics</span>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builder Lennar Corp. posted another quarter of gains in key metrics as the U.S. housing market continues to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's third-quarter results came in above analysts' expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fellow builder KB Home also reported continued growth in the latest quarter on Tuesday afternoon, with its per-share earnings beating analysts' expectations. The Los Angeles company's shares, up 21% this year, rose 3.5% to $15.45 in recent after-hours trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar Chief Executive Stuart Miller said "the housing market's recovery has continued to progress on a slow, steady and sometimes, choppy path."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, its margin fell and metrics for Miami-based <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>, one of the largest U.S. home builders by houses constructed, posted slower growth than in recent quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Lennar</span> shares, which fell 3.5% to $43.50 on Tuesday and are down 11% this year, were inactive after hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross margin on home sales fell to 22.6% from 24.1% on rising land costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number and average price of homes delivered rose in the quarter, driving revenue growth. The number of deliveries rose 7% for the third quarter from a year before as the average price of a delivered home increased 3.7% to $363,000. The number of new orders increased 8% as backlogs increased 12%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's results were hurt by its Houston segment whose large energy sector has been challenged by low energy prices in recent quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Lennar</span> reported a quarterly profit of $235.8 million, or $1.01 a share, up from $223.3 million, or 96 cents a share, a year prior. Revenue grew 13.7% to $2.83 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts polled by <span class="companylink">Thomson Reuters</span> projected 89 cents in per-share profit on $2.68 billion in revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> reported a profit of $39.4 million, or 42 cents a share, up from $23.3 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier. Total revenue increased 8.3% to $913.3 million. Home-building revenue grew 14% thanks to an 11% increase in deliveries and a 2% rise in average selling prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts polled by <span class="companylink">Thomson Reuters</span> expected per-share profit of 39 cents and revenue of $945 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net orders grew 16% to 2,508 and net order value improved by 20% to $930 million.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. households collectively reached a record net worth of $89.1 trillion in the second quarter, but behind that improvement were a wide range of outcomes for households digging out of an economic downturn over the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest snapshot of American wealth, released Friday by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>, marked the third straight quarter in which household wealth reached a new high, generally driven by a strong stock market and rising home values. Since the first quarter of this year, wealth in stocks and real-estate equity increased half a trillion dollars each, according to the central bank's quarterly report measuring the aggregate wealth of U.S. households and nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data underscore the U.S. economy's round trip over the past decade, from a housing bubble to a deep recession to a long and slow recovery that, while impressive in aggregate, has left many households behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The winners in recent years aren't the same people who lost out in the crash," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices peaked in 2006 and stocks peaked in 2007. Both plunged sharply as the U.S. collapsed into recession at the end of 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for those who held on through the crisis, prices have gradually rebounded in recent years. Stocks began to climb sharply in 2009 and by 2013 household wealth in stocks had reached a new peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Household net worth is the sum of all assets, such as homes, stocks, bonds, vehicles and cash, minus all debts like mortgages, credit cards, student loans and auto loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's report provides no information about how assets are distributed among households, but a relatively modest share of the stock market is owned by middle-income households. Edward Wolff, an economist at New York University, has estimated that as of 2013, about 90% of stocks and mutual funds were owned by the wealthiest 10% of households.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the middle-class stock wealth that does exist is tied up in retirement accounts, which are considered indirect holdings and may be largely off limits for years or decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home equity, however, is a different story. Mr. Wolff estimates 60% of the wealth in principal residences is held by those outside the top 10%. While the homeownership rate has declined in recent years, about 63% of homes still are owner-occupied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those homeowners "benefit from a broad increase in home values -- homes are much more broadly owned by the middle class than stocks," said Frank Nothaft, chief economist of real-estate-data provider CoreLogic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet even among homeowners, not everyone has benefited evenly from the recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than three million homeowners remain underwater on their mortgages, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> data. At the worst part of the housing bust, nearly 12 million were underwater, meaning they owed more on their mortgages than their homes were worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some families have seen price increases and mortgage payments push them back into positive territory. <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> estimates that about 548,000 homeowners regained equity in the second quarter. Other families, however, lost their homes to foreclosures. RealtyTrac estimates that in 2009, a record 2.1 million foreclosures were initiated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many of the cities that experienced the largest housing bubble, home prices remain far below levels once seen. Home prices in Las Vegas are down 36% from their record, according to the Case-Shiller home-price index, for example. In Phoenix, prices are nearly 30% below their peaks. Home prices in Miami remain nearly 25% lower. Cities with home prices that have fully recovered from the crisis and gone on to set new records include Dallas; Denver; Charlotte, N.C.; and San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also contributing to household net worth is an increase in the deposits U.S. households keep at banks. Deposits, such as checking and savings accounts, were a record $10.9 trillion in the second quarter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connecticut Island Asks $175 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Connecticut island going on the market for the first time in over a century is shooting for the moon: If it sells for anywhere near its asking price of $175 million, it could set a new record for most expensive residential property in the country, real-estate veterans said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 63-acre estate on Long Island Sound, located about 50 miles outside New York City in the affluent suburb of Darien, is one of the priciest residential properties on the market, said listing agent David Ogilvy of David Ogilvy &amp; Associates Realtors. The record is currently held by the 2014 sale of a $147 million home in New York's Hamptons, said real-estate appraiser Jonathan Miller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known as Great Island, the property is accessed via man-made land bridges. Built in the early 1900s, the main house has six bedrooms plus wings for staff and guests. The stone structure has views of the Sound from nearly every room, though the new owner will likely want to renovate the house, Mr. Ogilvy said. There are several additional homes on the property, one of which was built around 1850 but has been restored and expanded. With a private beach and a dock, the grounds also contain a boat house and small waterfront cottages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property has extensive equestrian facilities, including a 20-stall granite stable built at around the same time as the main house with an arched Guastavino tile ceiling similar to the one in Grand Central Terminal, Mr. Ogilvy said. There is also a Grand Prix jumping/riding arena, an exercise track, a sand dressage ring and bridle trails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate is owned by the descendants of industrialist William Ziegler, who bought the property around 1900 and used it as a summer home after making his fortune in baking powder. His granddaughter Helen married Olympic show jumper William Steinkraus and became an equestrian herself before her death in 2012. The family decided to sell Great Island because the "next generation has moved to other places," Mr. Ogilvy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2014 Mr. Ogilvy handled the $120 million sale of Copper Beech Farm, a roughly 50-acre property about 9 miles away in the nearby town of Greenwich, which was originally listed for $190 million. "The market for $100 million and up is a very small market," Mr. Ogilvy said. "Since we have one that sold here, that gives us something very good to work from."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Christie's International Real Estate</span> is providing international marketing for Great Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lake House of Late NFL Coach</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Landry For Sale</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family of the late NFL coach Tom Landry is selling the Texas lake house he built, putting it on the market for $1,249,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Coach," as the family called him, and his wife Alicia used the Austin-area home overlooking Lake Travis as a getaway from their primary home in Dallas, according to Gary Childress, Mr. Landry's son-in-law. Known for his trademark fedora, the Texas native was head coach of the Dallas Cowboys for 29 seasons, until the late 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Landrys built the five-bedroom house at the nine-unit Peninsula Villas condominium development around 1997. Mr. Childress, who owned the house next door, was a developer of the Peninsula Villas and Mr. Landry was an investor, he said. The home is located in the town of Spicewood, about 35 miles from Austin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Floor-to-ceiling glass offers lake views throughout the open-plan home, which measures about 4,000 square feet, according to listing agent Kat Brooks of Kuper Sotheby's International Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A multilevel patio overlooking the lake has an outdoor swimming pool and hot tub. Another deck opens off an upstairs family room, and a dumbwaiter transports food and drink from the kitchen below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property also has its own boat slip: Mr. Landry loved boating, Mr. Childress said, and the family would often take the boat out with food and wine at sunset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Landrys, who met as students at the <span class="companylink">University of Texas at Austin</span>, had been vacationing in the area for decades before building this house, Mr. Childress said. "They loved the Hill Country and Lake Travis," he said. "It was a place for the two of them to really get away and escape the spotlight."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Mr. Landry's death in 2000, Ms. Landry still spent a good deal of time with family at the Spicewood house. Now that her grandchildren are older, she doesn't make the trip from Dallas as often, Mr. Childress said, prompting the family to put the home on the market. "She's not using it as much," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Medical Facility to Manhattan Mansion: $72 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A century-old limestone building on Manhattan's Upper East Side, long used as a medical facility, is going on the market for $72 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built as a single-family home in 1917, the roughly 21,000-square-foot Beaux-Arts structure on 69th Street was for decades the headquarters of the Center for Specialty Care, an outpatient facility for plastic surgery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The center ceased operating a few months ago and the building is vacant, said listing agent Paula Del Nunzio of Brown Harris Stevens. She said much of the original floor plan remains intact and a buyer will most likely return the building to use as a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building has seven stories plus a basement, with three elevators, Ms. Del Nunzio said. There are multiple terraces, including a roof deck with views of Central Park, and the house retains many of its original details, including a curved staircase illuminated by a stained-glass dome. Ms. Del Nunzio added that the structure is particularly valuable for its width of about 44 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building was purchased in 1980 by the late plastic surgeon James W. Smith Jr., who converted it to the Center for Specialty Care. Dr. Smith, who was a professor at <span class="companylink">Weill Cornell Medical College</span>, died in 2006. The Smith family couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few blocks to the south, another limestone Upper East Side townhouse has been on the market for $84.5 million since February.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with Beanie Babies, the Sony Discman and other trends of the 1990s, the once wildly popular Mediterranean-style home has fallen out of fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An analysis of current home listings shows that asking prices for Mediterranean-style homes -- known for stucco walls, tumbled stone and wrought-iron accents -- have stalled in recent years, though they remain high. Now, modern architecture, with its subdued color palette and minimalist design, is popular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median list price for a Mediterranean-style home is $750,000 -- three times higher than the median list price for homes of all styles, according to Realtor.com. But since 2012, list prices of Mediterranean-style homes have remained flat, while median home prices overall rose 25%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its examination of four of the most-popular architectural home styles in the U.S. -- Mediterranean, modern, Colonial and Victorian -- Realtor.com found that Modern homes saw the biggest jump in median asking prices, which rose 37% over four years. (<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, which owns The Wall Street Journal, also owns Realtor.com.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The relative lack of appreciation of Mediterranean homes likely results from pent-up demand for newer and more versatile styles," says Javier Vivas of Realtor.com. "These other styles have attracted more eyes and fiercer competition, particularly since the recovery."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The listings database shows that 67% of Mediterranean-style homes currently on the market were built between 1990 and 2009. "Think of it as the Britney Spears of single-family home construction." Mr. Vivas says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was a period where people created a caricature of the Mediterranean or Tuscan style, increasingly ornate and garish," says Jay Kallos, an Atlanta-based architect for luxury home-builder Ashton Woods. "Now we're seeing some of that stuff peel away, maybe falling out of favor."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Kallos contends that the style's stigma won't last. "Good architecture always trumps in any style," he says. "A beautiful and well-designed home will always stand the test of time."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in Vancouver fell 26% in August compared with the same month last year, suggesting a new tax on foreign buyers could be affecting the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province of British Columbia began imposing a 15% tax on foreign buyers of homes in Vancouver at the start of August in an effort to cool rapidly rising housing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Morrison, president of the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver, said July and August sales are representative of more historically normal activity. He said it will take months to understand the full impact of the tax, but it appears to be reducing foreign-buyer activity and contributing to uncertainty among local buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the decline in sales, the benchmark prices for a typical Vancouver home continued to rise in August, up more than 31% from the same month last year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Avista Capital Partners</span> plans to launch a "blank check" company that would buy health-care companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm, which manages some $6 billion and typically targets middle-market companies, is seeking to raise $300 million in an initial public offering of the blank-check company, Avista Healthcare Public Acquisition Corp., according to a regulatory filing. Such companies, also known as special-purpose acquisition companies, raise money in public offerings to spend on future acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The money raised in the offering would position the <span class="companylink">Avista</span> venture to target companies valued between $1 billion and $2 billion, a person familiar with the deal said, which is larger than <span class="companylink">Avista</span>'s typical acquisitions through its private-equity funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Avista</span>, which was formed in 2005 by former employees of DLJ Merchant Banking Partners, joins a growing roster of financiers that recently launched blank-check companies, including TPG, former <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> partner Chinh Chu and the private-equity arm of mergers and acquisitions advisory firm <span class="companylink">Centerview Partners</span>. <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group AG</span> is the only underwriter on the deal, according to the filing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blank-check issuance has been a bright spot in an otherwise lackluster IPO market. SPACs raised $3.9 billion in 20 deals in 2015, their busiest year since before the financial crisis, according to Dealogic. So far this year, eight SPACs have raised $2.18 billion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Friday's jobs report for August[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/jobs-report-cool-august-soothes-markets-1472827907] provides the latest sign economic ups and downs aren't likely to confer an obvious edge for either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump entering the final fall stretch of the presidential campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Employers added 151,000 jobs in August [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-payroll-growth-slowed-in-august-jobless-rate-held-steady-1472819502]and the unemployment rate held steady at 4.9%, indicating neither an impending slowdown that might boost Mr. Trump, the GOP nominee, nor a strong upturn that would free Mrs. Clinton to more tightly embrace the economic record of President Barack Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the economy is generally sturdy and many of the worst-case economic fears for Democrats this year haven't materialized. Hiring in May slowed sharply, with employers adding just 24,000 hires, the worst month in five years. That proved an aberration. Job growth over the three months since then has averaged 232,000 jobs, near the highest level of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans cast Friday's numbers in a harsh light. The report showed "another month of mediocre job growth," said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus. The Trump campaign called separate trade and manufacturing data "horrible."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trump economic adviser David Malpass said in a statement that immigration—both legal and illegal—have "destroyed upward mobility, consumer purchasing power and the tax base of state, local and federal governments."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the hustings, Mrs. Clinton has managed a careful balancing act, touting the Obama administration's post-crisis policies while focusing more attention on lingering economic anxieties. Last month in Philadelphia, she said Mr. Obama had saved the economy from the worst financial crisis since the 1930s, rescued the auto industry and imposed tougher rules on Wall Street to prevent a rerun of the 2008 crackup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at other events in Iowa, Ohio and Michigan, her remarks on the economy didn't mention Mr. Obama by name and focused instead on stubborn problems like income inequality[http://graphics.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/elections/2016/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-on-the-economy/]. "The tide is not rising fast enough, and it's certainly not lifting all boats," she said in Warren, Mich., last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several economic measures have easily surpassed benchmarks Republican candidates laid out four years ago. Republican nominee Mitt Romney, for example, promised to bring unemployment down to 6% by this year. His GOP challenger, Newt Gingrich, had promised to bring gas prices down to $2.50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans will hit the roads for Labor Day weekend with gas prices at around $2.24 for a gallon of regular gasoline, the lowest level for this time of year since 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data show consumers maintain a relatively bright outlook. The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>'s consumer-confidence index advanced [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-consumer-confidence-climbs-to-highest-level-in-nearly-a-year-1472566221]to its highest level in nearly a year in August. Home sales are running at their highest levels since the housing bust deepened in 2007, and home prices have advanced to within 1% of their nominal record set last decade for the nation as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voters' perceptions of the election-year economy tend to crystallize in the summer, and Mrs. Clinton appears to have avoided storm clouds that loomed earlier this year. For example, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 6% this year, a gain that seemed unlikely six weeks into 2016, when the blue chip index shed more than 10%, sparking fears of a recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the latest jobs report offered little to suggest the economy was deviating from its recent path of steady if unremarkable growth. "There is nothing in this report that flashes a warning signal about where the economy is going," wrote economists at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> on Friday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the major pieces of economic data that remain before Election Day: the Labor Department will report twice more on payrolls, while the Census Bureau will release its annual snapshot, for 2015, of household incomes later this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some measures suggest the income report could be strong. Monthly estimates of household incomes by Sentier Research, a data firm formed by two former Census employees, imply median household incomes grew nearly 3.8% last year, the largest gain since its series began in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other economic indicators have been disappointing, giving Mr. Trump fodder to press his argument for change. Gross domestic product rose by a seasonally adjusted annual rate of just 1.1% in the second quarter after disappointing readings of 0.8% and 0.9% in the prior two periods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy has grown more slowly over the past year than any time since 2013, largely due to much slower growth abroad. A closely watched gauge of U.S. manufacturing activity contracted in August, with a reading below economists' expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current expansion, now in its eighth year, is the fourth-longest in the postwar period. Economists at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. said last week the probability the U.S. would enter a recession in the next 12 months had climbed to 37%, the highest for the current expansion cycle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists at <span class="companylink">Macroeconomic Advisers</span>, a forecasting firm, currently track third-quarter GDP running at a 3.4% gain. Economists at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> are forecasting a 2.8% gain, while <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> economists are expecting a 2% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Polls show voters are roughly divided [http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/washwire/2016/08/14/latest-poll-shows-clinton-holds-leads-in-battleground-states/]in their attitudes toward the economy. Last month's Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/hillary-clinton-widens-lead-over-donald-trump-in-battleground-states-1471015822] showed that 50% of voters agreed with the statement that said Democrats should continue to control the White House, while 48% said it was "time for change." Those numbers are slightly better for Democrats than the 47%-to-45% advantage Republicans held on the same question in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same poll showed that Mrs. Clinton has narrowed Mr. Trump's advantage on the economy. Some 46% of voters say Mr. Trump would be a better manager of the economy, down from 47% in May, while 42% prefer Mrs. Clinton, up from 36% in May. Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, maintained a 16-point advantage on the question of which candidate cares "about people like me."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Center for Excellence in Higher Education, a Salt Lake City-based college operator, filed a civil lawsuit Tuesday in federal court in Utah challenging the <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Education</span>'s decision last month to classify its schools as for-profit colleges for financial-aid purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The school group, known as CEHE, applied to the Education Department for nonprofit status nearly four years ago after buying four colleges from Carl Barney, who is now chairman of the board.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suit asks the court to declare its schools nonprofit for Title IV student-aid purposes, saying the department's decision is "arbitrary and capricious and inconsistent with the treatment of similarly situated nonprofit schools."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman from the Department of Education declined to comment on the suit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a for-profit chain, CEHE faces stricter oversight of student outcomes than do nonprofit institutions, such as having to report loan repayment data to prove it prepares students for gainful employment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—A measure of homes under contract for sale rose in July, a sign of steady demand amid low interest rates and rising employment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>' pending home sales index, which tracks contract signings for purchases of previously owned homes, increased a seasonally adjusted 1.3% to 111.3 in July, the trade group said Wednesday. Sales then typically close within a month or two of signings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 0.7% rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index had registered at a downwardly revised 109.9 in June. It reached a post-housing bust peak of 115.0 in April and now sits at the second-highest level of 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July's reading was 1.4% above its year-ago level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"More home shoppers having success is good news for the housing market heading into the fall, but buyers still have few choices and little time before deciding to make an offer on a home available for sale," said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>., owner of The Wall Street Journal, also owns <span class="companylink">Move Inc</span>., which operates a website and mobile products for the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been a relative bright spot in the economy in recent years, though it has shown signs of cooling amid high prices and tight inventories. Last week, the Realtors group reported that the pace of existing-home sales fell 3.2% last month from June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.39 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report shows home prices posting another strong gain. The S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller Indices, covering the entire nation, rose 5.1% in the 12 months ended in June, identical to the increase reported in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While some of the near-term signals on the housing market have been mixed, we still expect the housing recovery to continue over time," said Daniel Silver, economist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales were up in July across most of the country. In the Northeast the index rose 0.8% to 96.8, in the South it was up 0.8% to 123.9 and in the West it jumped 7.3% to 108.7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales fell in the Midwest. The index for the region decreased 2.9% to 105.8 in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low mortgage rates and continuing job creation may be luring more would-be buyers into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has held below 3.5% for nine consecutive weeks, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. employers, meanwhile, have been generating jobs at a healthy clip in recent months. Nonfarm payrolls rose a seasonally adjusted 255,000 in July, the Labor Department said early in August. The August report is due out Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the U.S. homeownership rate fell to the lowest level in more than 50 years in the second quarter of 2016, a reflection of the lingering effects of the housing bust, financial hurdles to buying and shifting demographics across the country.</p>

Tribune Media to Sell Iconic Tribune Tower in Roughly $240 Million Deal</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Chicago Tribune</span>'s former parent company <span class="companylink">Tribune Media Co</span>. is selling the Tribune Tower, one of the city's most iconic skyscrapers, in a deal valued at about $240 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Tribune Tower has been a unique part of Chicago's skyline since the 1920s," Chief Executive Peter Liguori said Tuesday in a news release. "It is a gem of architectural and structural accomplishment and a constant reminder of the important role that <span class="companylink">Tribune</span> has played in the development of the city itself."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built at the southern tip of Chicago's Magnificent Mile, the neo-gothic tower is home to the Chicago daily newspaper. It was the winning design of a competition organized by the newspaper's publishers, coinciding with the <span class="companylink">Tribune</span>'s 75th anniversary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Tribune</span> Media -- which last year spun off its publishing business, home to such titles as the <span class="companylink">Chicago Tribune</span> and <span class="companylink">Los Angeles Times</span> -- has been selling a number of its properties, including the historic <span class="companylink">Los Angeles Times</span> building near City Hall and the Olympic printing plant in downtown L.A., to boost its flagging stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock, which set a low on Feb. 11, closed Tuesday at $39.01, up 15% for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest sale, expected to close in the current quarter, would also include a 36,000-quare-foot development at the east of the tower, fronting Cityfront Plaza, the company said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the terms of the deal, <span class="companylink">CIM Group</span> would pay $205 million in cash at closing and an additional $35 million after certain conditions are met.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Housing Prices Vex Millennials</span>
</div><div class="author">By Steven Russolillo   </div><div>385 words</div><div>30 August 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millennials have benefited the least from today's strong housing market. A likely slowdown won't help either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By some measures in the U.S., there has never been a better time to own a home. Wages are rising, unemployment is falling and interest rates are hovering near record lows. That has helped boost home values, a trend that likely will be seen in data out Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal estimate the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller 20-City Home Price Index rose 5.2% in the 12-month period ended in June. Prices have grown at about a 5% clip since early 2015 and appear to be on the verge of surpassing precrisis highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of that is little solace to adults who haven't stepped on the housing ladder's first rung. Their caution has helped drag the homeownership rate to a record low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study by national realtor Redfin found affordability was the biggest concern among all U.S. home buyers. The results were even more striking among Americans 35 and younger. One-third of surveyed millennials said the fact that "prices are rising or are too high" was their biggest concern. That was more than double the next biggest worry -- competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news: One driver of rising home values has been a lack of supply. Prices are unlikely to keep rising at the current pace. And over the long term, home prices have risen much closer to the rate of inflation. Barring an exogenous shock, a reversion to the mean appears likely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bad news is that, even if incomes keep rising, the housing market still isn't poised to get more affordable soon. A continued economic recovery means the opposite might happen. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen sent a strong signal last week that the central bank will raise short-term interest rates again, perhaps even next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the affordability equation, an uptick in rates can't be ignored. If 30-year mortgage rates rise by 1 percentage point a year from now and home prices hold steady, a monthly mortgage payment could jump by about 13%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expect the ranks of homeowners to keep dwindling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> extended its winning streak Tuesday when it beat market estimates for the fourth straight quarter with strong pretax income up 52% to $164 million on revenue up 24% to $1.27 billion for its fiscal third quarter as of July 31. Toll's good news on the luxury home front was joined by the release of encouraging industry data showing July new home sales jumped a surprising 12% versus June and were up 31% versus weak results last year, helped, we believe, by two straight months of sharply lower median pricing which fell by more than 17% y/y in July following the 12.5% y/y drop in June. Annualized new home sales now have recovered to 2008 levels, still well off peak sales before the recession but now at least courting the 50-year average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"> Such broad- based improvement in demand as indicated from more price-conscious and luxury buyers also suggest sustainably positive trends well into next year at a slow to moderate pace—as long as home price inflation is held reasonably in check.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">about the author</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vicki Bryan has 30 years of experience in the investment industry with 22 years covering high yield and distressed companies across a broad variety of industries. She was an independent management consultant advising in financial and operational strategies to distressed and emerging growth companies and a partner, vice president, and senior analyst with AIM Investment Management. Bryan earned her M.S. in finance from <span class="companylink">University of Houston</span>, where she also was an adjunct professor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll's revenue was fueled by strong gains in average pricing (up 16%), helped by favorable mix, and traditional home segment deliveries (up 15%) which offset sharply lower high rise sales. Community count also jumped another 11% to 297. Total deliveries were up 6% as a result versus dismal results last year when they fall 2%, with growth in North, West, and California markets easily offsetting softness in Mid-Atlantic and southern regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operating margins were little improved despite the boost in revenue. Adjusted gross margin was 25.3%, essentially flat when we adjusted last year's number for increased reserves. SG&amp;A was held at less than 11% of revenue, which nudged Ebitda margin up 50 bps to 16.9%. Ebitda still was up a strong 27% to $215 million, which helped to hold leverage at 4.6 times versus 4.4 times last year on debt up another $374 million in the quarter to $3.88 billion. This borrowing plus some $71 million in cash on hand funded roughly $300 million in cash consumed in operations (mostly to fund sharply higher land spend at $459 million) and another $97 million spent to buy back stock. Ending cash remained adequate at more than $350 million, backstopped by $765 million in available credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We expect much if not all of that cash to be replenished in the fourth quarter, when we think Toll may generate more than $330 million in Ebitda (up 25%) on $1.74 billion in revenue (up 22%). Toll's forward trends suggest flat to improving margins on potentially accelerating sales as it continues to attract profitable, well-balanced demand. Third quarter orders were up 18% and the backlog was up 17%, both versus strong results last year, on average pricing essentially flat to only slightly lower versus generous levels last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Management tightened further its 2016 guidance with revenue now projected up 19-26% on deliveries up 7% to 12% and pricing up 11% to 13%, further boosting the low end of previously targeted ranges and backing off higher numbers which we speculated back in December as too ambitious. Our estimates are little changed, with 2016 revenue still projected near $5.06 billion (up 21%) and Ebitda near $900 million (up 20%), free cash flow now nearly breakeven on higher land spend, and leverage near 4.3x versus 5.1x in 2015. We still estimate 2017 revenue near $5.82 billion (up 15%) with EBITDA near $1.1 billion million (up 19%), free cash flow near $170 million, and leverage near 3.8 times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll's bonds due in 2022 to 2025 are up 1 to 3 points to 102.6 to 109.6 (3.8% to 4.4% yield to worst) since May, when we increased our rating to "outperform" from "underperform." We still see further upside from current levels given the continuing improvement we expect in Toll's operating trends and credit quality and firming housing market conditions. Maintain "outperform."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes slipped in July, a sign that higher prices are taking a bite out of U.S. housing demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of existing-home sales decreased 3.2% last month from June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.39 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday. The decrease was the first since February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with a year earlier, July sales were down 1.6%, but the pace remains near postrecession highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're running out of customers," said Sam Khater, deputy chief economist at data company <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>. "There's a logjam: You've got first-time buyers who can't buy, trade-up buyers who can't move up, and it's grinding to a halt."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the country's hottest markets are showing more dramatic signs of slowing as buyers balk at rising prices. Sales of single-family homes and condominiums in California were down 13% in July compared with a year earlier, according to real-estate tracker PropertyRadar. Sales of single-family homes and condos in Denver declined 18% compared with the same time last year, according to the Denver Metro Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the drop in the local data can be attributed to a quirk of the calendar year in which there were fewer business days in July than in the year-earlier month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those markets also are showing signs of long-term softening. In San Francisco, home sales tumbled 10% in the first half of 2016 from a year earlier, their slowest first half since 2008, according to PropertyRadar. The market had been red hot as job growth in the technology sector fueled rapid price gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Denver, another hot market in recent years, single-family-home and condo sales were down 4% so far this year compared with last year, according to the Denver Metro Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One worrying sign in these markets is that inventory is swelling, suggesting demand is slipping as prices grow out of reach for many buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices have gotten so high and they've grown so quickly in these hot markets and people are afraid. Last time there was this big correction," said Nela Richardson, chief economist at real-estate brokerage Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory of homes for sale in the San Francisco metro area was up 36% in July compared with a year earlier, according to Redfin. Homes are now sitting on the market for 24 days, a week longer than they were a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the story is slightly different, as inventory has continued to tighten, indicating that the broader slowdown is being driven by a lack of homes for sale. Wednesday's <span class="companylink">NAR</span> report showed it would take 4.7 months to exhaust the supply of existing homes on the market at the end of July. Supply has fallen from a year earlier for 14 straight months.</p>

U.S. Government Bonds See Little Change; Investors waiting on Friday's speech by Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen Bonds See Little Change; Investors waiting on Friday's speech by Fed Chairwoman</span>
</div><div class="author">By Carolyn Cui </div><div>546 words</div><div>24 August 2016</div><div>16:46</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> bonds were little changed Wednesday, with many investors sitting on their hands ahead of Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen's remarks on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was at 1.558% in New York afternoon trading, according to <span class="companylink">Tradeweb</span>, up from 1.553% on Tuesday. Yields rise when bond prices fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trading has been light in late August with many traders away from their desks for summer holidays, but flows are exceptionally low in the Treasury market, which is extremely sensitive to what Ms. Yellen is going to say  [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/feds-yellen-to-speak-at-jackson-hole-conference-1464892980]in Jackson Hole, Wyo. The Fed Chairwoman is scheduled to speak at a summit held on Friday, as Fed officials meet [http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/moneybeat/2016/08/19/ahead-of-yellens-jackson-hole-speech-sifting-through-the-tea-leaves/] to discuss "resilient monetary policy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't remember as much anticipation around Jackson Hole probably since 2010" when traders were looking for clues as to whether the Fed would launch the second around of quantitative easing, said Priya Misra, head of global rates strategy at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> USA, adding "and Bernanke delivered."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expectations are high this time as investors have been getting seemingly inconsistent views  [http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/moneybeat/2016/08/17/people-are-getting-emotional-about-feds-schizophrenic-debate/]from Fed officials in recent weeks and are eager to find out where Ms. Yellen stands in the debate. The key question on investors' mind is whether the Fed is changing its monetary-policy framework in a low growth environment that allows for overshooting or if the Fed is still on the tightening path in the near term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If there was a time for her to talk about perhaps overshooting, nominal GDP targeting or a higher inflation target, this would be the time to do it," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of clarity on the Fed's rate path has left most traders to muddle in the middle ground. In the latest client survey conducted by <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>, 64% of the respondents said they were neutral on U.S. rates, with 25% leaning on the long side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the near term, analysts say the path of U.S. interest rates is determined by two forces: the demand for U.S. Treasurys among global investors pushed by near-zero yields in rich nations, and the Fed's narrative on its rate-increasing policies [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-officials-gain-confidence-they-can-raise-rates-this-year-1468922401].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the Treasury department's five-year notes auction met with strong demand, as non-dealer bidding hit 75% compared with the average of 67% for five-year notes.

</div><div class="author">By Aaron Back </div><div>482 words</div><div>24 August 2016</div><div>12:53</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America's housing market is in good shape, giving the nation's banks a fresh engine for loan growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankers aren't fond of ultralow interest rates, as they make the business of lending less profitable. But major lenders in the U.S. have been able to grow interest income anyway by pushing more loans out the door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past couple of years, commercial and industrial loans were the prime driver of growth. Recently this has slowed, due in part to less appetite for funding in the oil and gas sectors. But lending to consumers, particularly through credit cards, has accelerated. Now, strong mortgage growth is adding another driver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market in the U.S. is robust, thanks to mortgage rates that have fallen to nearly record lows and a strong jobs market. On Tuesday, government data showed new-home sales in July [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-rise-to-highest-level-since-2007-1471961003]soaring to their best level since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, data from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> showed a 3.2% annualized decline[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-fell-sharply-in-july-1472047382] in July for the more important category of existing-home sales. But this came after several months of strong gains, and represents only a slight fall from nine-year highs. This year is still on track to be the best for existing-home sales since 2006, estimate economists at <span class="companylink">IHS</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, prices are up, with the median existing-home price rising 5.4% from a year earlier in July. This means mortgage sizes are growing, even without more unit sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks are also choosing to hold more mortgages on their books, rather than sell them off. According to <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> data, total mortgage loans held by U.S. banks rose an annualized 10.5% in July, the fastest pace since 2011. The total proportion of all mortgage debt [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/banks-are-falling-back-in-love-with-mortgages-1461698968]held by banks is still low compared with before the financial crisis, but it has been steadily rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Record-low interest rates should also drive refinancing activity. This is a double-edged sword for banks. It is another source of lending growth, but it also means existing loans are being swapped out for new ones at lower rates. Particularly for banks with big holdings of mortgage-backed securities[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/why-some-banks-are-hurt-more-than-others-by-falling-rates-1466092837], this can be a problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a spike in refinancing activity after rates plunged in the wake of the Brexit referendum in late June, but this has since tapered off. If rates take another leg down, expect another growth spurt in both new mortgages and refinancing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third quarter began right after the Brexit vote. For most banks, the subsequent volatility and mortgage-refinancing uptick should be a boost in the quarter. Coupled with improved mortgage lending, they could help banks offset at least some of the drag of super-low interest rates.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto and Eric Morath </div><div>948 words</div><div>24 August 2016</div><div>17:58</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of previously owned homes slipped in July, a sign that higher prices are taking a bite out of U.S. housing demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of existing-home sales decreased 3.2% last month[http://www.realtor.org/news-releases/2016/08/existing-home-sales-lose-steam-in-july] from June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.39 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday. The decrease was the first since February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a July sales pace of 5.52 million. Compared with a year earlier, July sales were down 1.6%, but the pace remains near postrecession highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're running out of customers," said Sam Khater, deputy chief economist at data company <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>. "There's a logjam: You've got first-time buyers who can't buy, trade-up buyers who can't move up, and it's grinding to a halt."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the country's hottest markets are showing more dramatic signs of slowing as buyers balk at rising prices. Sales of single-family homes and condominiums in California were down 13% in July compared with a year earlier, according to real-estate tracker PropertyRadar. Sales of single-family homes and condos in Denver declined 18% compared with the same time last year, according to the Denver Metro Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the drop in the local data can be attributed to a quirk of the calendar year in which there were fewer business days in July than in the year-earlier month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those markets also are showing signs of long-term softening. In San Francisco, home sales tumbled 10% in the first half of 2016 from a year earlier, their slowest first half since 2008, according to PropertyRadar. The market had been red hot as job growth in the technology sector fueled rapid price gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Denver, another hot market in recent years, single-family-home and condo sales were down 4% so far this year compared with last year, according to the Denver Metro Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One worrying sign in these markets is that inventory is swelling, suggesting demand is slipping as prices grow out of reach for many buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices have gotten so high and they've grown so quickly in these hot markets and people are afraid…maybe the housing market is at all-time highs. Last time there was this big correction," said Nela Richardson, chief economist at real-estate brokerage Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory of homes for sale in the San Francisco metro area was up 36% in July compared with a year earlier, according to Redfin. Homes are now sitting on the market for 24 days, a week longer than they were a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory of homes and condos for sale in Denver ticked up 10% compared with June, according to the local Realtors, though it was essentially flat from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Part of it is just things have grown in terms of pricing and competition so aggressively over the last few years that it was just kind of unsustainable," said Miriam Westberg, a Redfin agent in San Francisco. "With added inventory, with some shift in the market, buyers are being a little more picky and taking their time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nanci Champlin, a 48-year-old nonprofit worker, and her husband had been looking for six years to buy a house in Portland; they rented in the meantime. She said they had put countless offers in on homes and watched as the market in the last year grew increasingly heated. "The market ran away from us," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Champlin said this summer they noticed a slight cooling. A house next to their neighborhood sat on the market for two weeks with no offers. They made an offer at the listed priced of $465,000 and it was readily accepted with no bidding war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They closed on the purchase a week ago and the home was appraised for $54,000 more than they paid. "I cant even count how many offers we've put in and to finally land that and to have the appraisal come back higher was really more than we expected," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the story is slightly different, as inventory has continued to tighten, indicating that the broader slowdown is being driven by a lack of homes for sale. Wednesday's <span class="companylink">NAR</span> report showed it would take 4.7 months to exhaust the supply of existing homes on the market at the end of July. Supply has fallen from a year earlier for 14 straight months. Total housing inventory at the end of July decreased 5.8% from a year earlier to 2.13 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Limited supply helped fuel a 5.3% gain in the median home price, to $244,100, in July from the year-earlier month. Production of new single-family homes, which accounts for a small share of the overall housing market, is still about 30% below the long-term historical average, though a report this week showed a 31% jump in July from the same month last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far this year, existing home sales are trending near the pace recorded just before the recession began. Still, the pace is well below the peak reached in 2005, when more than 7 million properties were sold.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-Home Sales Slipped 3.2% in July</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes slipped in July, a sign the U.S. housing-market recovery could be uneven as limited inventory and rising prices put purchases out of reach for some Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of existing-home sales decreased 3.2% last month[http://www.realtor.org/news-releases/2016/08/existing-home-sales-lose-steam-in-july] from June to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.39 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday. It was the first time sales had decreased since February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales for June were unrevised at 5.57 million, the best pace of the expansion. From a year earlier, July sales were down 1.6%. The data suggest rapidly rising prices and limited inventory is cooling sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices are rising, and it's clearly due to a lack of inventory," said Realtors economist Lawrence Yun. "There is plenty of demand," he said, but buyers can't find properties in their price range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also owns <span class="companylink">Move Inc</span>., which operates a website and mobile products for the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of an existing home sold in July was $244,100, up 5.3% from a year earlier. That is rising much faster than overall inflation and wage growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report showed it would take 4.7 months to exhaust the supply of existing homes on the market at the end of July. Supply has fallen from a year earlier for 14 straight months. Total housing inventory at the end of July decreased 5.8% from a year ago to 2.13 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of first-time buyers was 32% in July, down slightly from June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest figures indicate the housing market could be challenged to repeat the strong first half of 2016. Historically low mortgage interest rates, improving income growth and steady job creation have supported buying of both new and existing homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 3.48% at the end of July, down a half-percentage point from a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far this year, existing home sales are trending near the pace recorded just before the recession began. Still, the pace is well below the peak reached in 2005 when more than 7 million properties were sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said Tuesday that new homes, just 10% of the market, sold at the best pace since 2007[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-rise-to-highest-level-since-2007-1471961003] in July. But that same report showed availability of new homes was at a three-year low. And in some markets, with especially low unemployment, inventory is even tighter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If builders are unable to increase supply, prices of existing homes will rise and that could slow demand because some would-be buyers will remain in the rental market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home-price growth is outpacing rent growth," Mr. Yun said. "Which makes it difficult for renters to convert to buyers."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll Brothers Inc. reported results for the third quarter on Tuesday. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said results were for the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. on Tuesday reported double-digit percentage growth in profit and revenue in the third quarter as the housing market continues its recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said homeowners have been building up home equity since the financial crisis and could soon move to new digs, either into bigger homes as children are born or downsizing as children move out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The solid economy and employment picture are also benefiting our target customers," said Executive Chairman Robert I. Toll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company narrowed its annual revenue guidance to a range of $4.96 billion to $5.27 billion. It had previously projected between $4.76 billion to $5.36 billion. Analysts polled by <span class="companylink">Thomson Reuters</span> predicted $5.04 billion in revenue for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the quarter ended July 31, Toll posted a profit of $105.5 million, or 61 cents a share, up from $66.8 million, or 36 cents a share, a year prior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue rose 24% to $1.27 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $1.25 billion and earnings per share of 61 cents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Results in the third quarter were broad-based across the country, with every region showing contract growth. Over all, backlog jumped 19% during the period as contracts rose 13%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue from Toll's City Living division, which builds urban apartments, decreased 13% to $52.5 million as the average price per unit jumped to $3.8 million from $756,400 as the number of units slumped. The segment, much smaller than Toll's other regions, is a play on the growth of cities as the U.S. continues to urbanize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert and Bruce Toll started <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> in 1967 in Pennsylvania. The company has focused on building more-customized and higher-end homes than competitors. The brothers took the company public in July 1986.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homes in their first community in Chester County sold for an average of $20,000. The company said the average price of a home delivered in its third quarter was $842,700, up from $724,500 a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>, up 22% from its low in February, fell 2.2% to $28.70 in premarket trading.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of newly built homes rose in July to the highest level in nearly a decade, a sign of solid momentum in the U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of new single-family homes rose 12.4% in July from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 654,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. That was the highest level since October 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"New-home sales soared again," said Ralph McLaughlin, economist at real-estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. "This is a continued sign that demand for new homes remains solid in a low interest rate, low unemployment environment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected home sales in July to slow to a pace of 580,000. Sales in June were revised down to 582,000 from an initially estimated 592,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the first seven months of the year, new-home sales rose 12.4% compared with the year-earlier period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been a bright spot in the economy this year. Historically low mortgage interest rates, improving income growth and steady job creation have supported buying of both new and existing homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes rose to their strongest pace in nearly a decade in June, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. The group will release July figures on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes account for less than a tenth of total U.S. home-buying activity. Data on such purchases are volatile from month to month and subject to later revision. July's increase came with a margin of error of plus or minus 12.7 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales in July were up 31.3% from a year earlier. The latest figure brings new-home sales back to the level recorded just before the recession. But the pace remains well below the peak of 1.39 million in July 2005.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obama Set to Visit</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flood-Ravaged Areas</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Barack Obama was scheduled to visit Baton Rouge Tuesday afternoon to inspect areas hit by unprecedented flooding two weekends ago. The White House hopes the visit will underscore the federal government's support for those hurt in the deluge and also counter critics who questioned why the president didn't arrive earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirteen people died and tens of thousands of homes were damaged in floods after pounding rains across southern Louisiana on the weekend of Aug. 12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump visited the area Aug. 19 and handed out supplies to flood victims. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton said she will visit the region at a later date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the <span class="companylink">Federal Emergency Management Agency</span> said that it has provided more than $127 million so far to help people hit by the flooding -- including $107 million to help pay for temporary rent, home repairs and other disaster-related needs. FEMA has paid out another $20 million to flood-insurance policyholders who have filed claims, according to a spokesman. FEMA is paying for about 700 families to be housed in hotels and motels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many homes damaged in the flooding didn't have flood insurance, according to the Baton Rouge Area Chamber, an area business organization. In a report issued Tuesday, the group estimated that in the Baton Rouge area, 53,896 homes out of a total of 352,165 had flood insurance -- only about 15% of the total. The report estimated that 146,156 homes were hurt by the flooding.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Constructionon a 1,154-mile pipeline that would carry oil from North Dakota to Illinois will remain halted at a site near the Missouri River after a federal judge postponed a hearing to determine whether protesters should be prevented from accessing the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tensions between the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which opposes the pipeline, and local police have escalated in recent weeks. More than two dozen protesters have been arrested after they blocked entry to the site 34 miles south of Mandan, N.D.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dakota Access is being built by <span class="companylink">Energy Transfer Partners LP</span> and its affiliate, Sunoco Logistics Partners LP.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judge Daniel Hovland of U.S. District Court for the District of North Dakota pushed a hearing to decide whether to grant a preliminary injunction sought by the company to Sept. 8 from this Thursday.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on single-family home construction remains 40% below the levels of a decade ago, but new forecasts project U.S. investment in residential remodeling and repairs this year will surpass records set during the housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expense for repairs and remodeling is expected to surpass $300 billion this year, according to forecasts from John Burns Real Estate Consulting and the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, ahead of the previous high of about $285 billion in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remodeling and home building both declined significantly in the years following the real estate bust, but the fall was much less steep for home renovation. Experts said the unusual nature of this housing recovery -- with very low inventories of houses for sale, often leading to price appreciation and bidding wars -- has prompted many homeowners to stay put and improve the home they have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you're shopping for a home, the number of options out there are really low," said Todd Tomalak, a vice president at John Burns Real Estate Consulting who focuses on building products research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of for-sale listings as a percentage of occupied houses in the U.S. has hit a record low this year, according to data compiled by the firm. Recent surveys have shown that a lack of available houses and apartments is one of the top reasons prospective home buyers haven't moved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brad Hunter, chief economist at HomeAdvisor, an online home improvement marketplace, said home renovation has bounced back more strongly than new-home construction because consumers can do projects bit by bit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Buying a house is a massive proposition for just about anybody: You have to jump through a lot of hoops and you have to have virtually spotless credit these days," said Mr. Hunter. Those who already own homes, on the other hand, have seen their equity rise in recent years, increasing their borrowing power. "They're able to get the loans they need to, and they're able to dip into savings," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooke Port and her husband, Tyler, were looking to buy a bigger house this year in the Denver area, after the value of the home they bought in 2013 had risen nearly 60%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But inventories of homes for sale in metro Denver are among the lowest in the country, meaning there was fierce competition for the few houses they liked. So instead, they decided to tap into their equity and remodel the kitchen, floors and basement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We'll be a lot happier in this home having all these upgrades," Ms. Port said. She feels the investment will boost the value of the house, and allow them to eventually trade up in "a less crazy market in a couple of years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home improvement is expected to continue rising over the next three years. The John Burns group forecasts spending on repairs and remodeling will grow faster than new residential construction through 2019, largely because of a slowdown in multifamily apartment projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor expected to drive spending on remodeling: America's homes are getting older. Homes built more than 30 years ago now make up 65% of the nation's housing stock, up from 47% in 1995, according to census data analyzed by the John Burns team.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale of the Playboy Mansion to next door neighbor Daren Metropoulos has closed for $100 million, said a spokesperson for Mr. Metropoulos. According to public records it is the highest price ever paid for a Los Angeles residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roughly 5-acre Holmby Hills estate was listed in January for $200 million. As part of the deal, <span class="companylink">Playboy Enterprises Inc</span>. founder Hugh Hefner will continue to occupy the Mansion for his lifetime. Playboy will pay Mr. Metropoulos $1 million a year for upkeep of the property while Mr. Hefner is living there, according to people with knowledge of the transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal is believed to be the highest price ever paid for a Los Angeles home. In 2014 Fleur de Lys, a mansion of over 40,000 square feet, sold for $88.3 million, according to public records. Furniture that was sold along with the house brought the total price of Fleur de Lys to $102 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Metropoulos, 33-year-old principal at private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Metropoulos &amp; Co</span>. and a current co-owner of <span class="companylink">Hostess Brands LLC</span>, bought his 1920s house, which had been used by Mr. Hefner's former wife to raise their two children, from Mr. Hefner in 2009 for $18 million and has restored it. He said he intends to connect the two estates after Mr. Hefner's tenancy ends, creating a 7.3-acre compound. "I look forward to eventually rejoining the two estates and enjoying this beautiful property as my private residence for years to come," he said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Playboy Mansion, purchased by <span class="companylink">Playboy Enterprises</span> in 1971 for $1.05 million, is Mr. Hefner's longtime home and is famous for its parties. Built in the 1920s, the roughly 20,000-square-foot home has 29 rooms. Mr. Hefner added a heated swimming pool and a grotto in the 1970s. The property also contains a zoo with exotic birds and monkeys, and is one of the only homes in Los Angeles to have a zoo license.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale price includes many of the statues on the property and the contents of the game room, including pinball machines, according to people with knowledge of the transaction. The price doesn't include the most of the mansion's furniture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The listing agents were Gary Gold and Drew Fenton of Hilton &amp; Hyland and Mauricio Umansky of the Agency. Jade Mills of Coldwell Banker Previews International represented Mr. Metropoulos.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do strip clubs bring down property values?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study by economists at <span class="companylink">West Virginia University</span> and the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse suggests they don't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surveying 317,056 residential sales in Seattle between Jan. 1, 2000, and Dec. 31, 2013, researchers found little evidence strip clubs influenced the prices of nearby homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This, note authors Taggert Brooks of UW-La Crosse and Brad Humphreys and Adam Nowak of WVU, runs counter to common arguments underpinning local governments' rights to restrict strip clubs, which typically hold that such establishments have negative "secondary effects," including a downward pull on property values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relationship between strip clubs and property values hadn't been investigated in a systematic way, says Dr. Humphreys. But his past work collecting data on Seattle's housing market, and a quirk in the city's strip-club regulations, provided an opportunity to look into the question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle maintained a moratorium on new strip clubs from 1998 until 2005, when a federal judge ruled the restriction unconstitutional. In 2008, new strip clubs began opening in the city, providing Dr. Humphreys and colleagues with variation in the number and location of clubs to study the effect of the establishments on nearby home prices. Their findings were published on the Social Science Research Network website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers looked at how home resale prices varied with proximity to strip clubs, whether prices changed on the opening or closing of a club nearby, and whether specific clubs had effects on their local housing markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some types of homes showed significant variation. Condos within 1,000 feet of a club sold for 5.5% less than those more than 2,000 feet away; single-family homes within 2,000 feet sold for 4.8% more than those more than 2,000 feet away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, however, most measurements showed no statistically significant link between strip clubs and home prices. (So-called p-values were used to determine significance.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was nothing we picked up that was really significant in any way, shape, or form," says Dr. Nowak.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home builders said they are becoming more optimistic about the market for single-family homes, boosting hopes that a recent rise in home buying could lead to more construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A measure of home-builder confidence rose two points from a month earlier to 60 in August, matching the second-highest level of the year, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> trade group said Monday. The reading matched the expectation of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists track the index because when builders gain confidence, they are more likely to begin projects. Higher construction creates jobs, in turn lifting the economy to stronger growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sentiment among home builders has been choppy this year, and the index is lower than it was from a year earlier. But builders remain optimistic overall despite a slowdown in economic growth in the first half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builder confidence remains solid in the aftermath of weak GDP [gross-domestic-product] reports that were offset by positive job growth in July," the NAHB's chief economist, Robert Dietz, said in a statement. "Historically low mortgage rates, increased household formations and a firming labor market will help keep housing on an upward path during the rest of the year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's report showed a measure of builders' views about the present market rose two points to 65 this month. An index of their outlook for the market over the next six months rose a single point to 67. Another component, measuring traffic of prospective buyers, fell a point to 44.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has picked up this year. Sales of previously owned homes, the bulk of the market, rose to their highest level in more than nine years in July, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But home construction has stalled. Housing starts, or the units that builders broke ground on, fell 2% in the year through June, Commerce Department data show. The agency was set to release July figures Tuesday. Home builders have said that regulations and shortages of land and labor have been preventing a stronger recovery in home construction.</p>

</div><div class="author">By David George-Cosh </div><div>465 words</div><div>15 August 2016</div><div>12:07</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TORONTO—Sales of existing homes in Canada fell for a third consecutive month in July due largely to a slowdown in activity in the westernmost province of British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Canadian Real Estate Association</span>, the industry group representing Realtors across the country, said Monday that existing-home sales fell 1.3% from June. Sales in Vancouver, one of Canada's most closely watched markets, were down 18.3% from a year earlier, while sales rose 1.1% in Toronto and 2.8% in Montreal, it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Monthly declines[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/canadian-existing-home-sales-fall-in-june-1468595865] overall in the past two months have left sales activity 3.9% below a record set in April, the group said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing activity and prices throughout Canada continue to be closely watched by policy makers as the country's energy- and mining-dependent economy slows. Last month, Bank of Canada Gov. Stephen Poloz said he is concerned that house prices in Vancouver and Toronto, two particularly overheated markets, appear out of step with economic fundamentals[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/hot-housing-markets-not-keeping-bank-of-canada-from-cutting-rates-poloz-says-1468612164].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an effort to help cool the housing market in its largest city, British Columbia introduced a 15% property transfer tax earlier this month for foreign buyers in Vancouver[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/vancouver-unveils-new-tax-for-foreign-home-buyers-1469478909]. The Realtors group said Monday it will take some time before the effect of the new tax on sales and prices can be observed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's still a two-horse race in the Canadian housing market if you lump in the areas surrounding Vancouver and Toronto," said Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, in a note. "All eyes will be on how prices in the former fare through the rest of the year, considering the new tax and already-moderating supply-demand conditions in that city."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes across Canada were down 2.9% from a year earlier, the first annual decline since January 2015 and the largest drop since April 2013, the latest data showed. According to the industry group, 48,099 homes were sold in July, down from 49,540 in the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National average prices for homes sold in July jumped 9.9% from a year earlier, to 480,743 Canadian dollars (US$371,087). Excluding Vancouver and Toronto, which the group said "are among Canada's tightest, most active and expensive housing markets," the year-over-year increase was a smaller 7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"National sales and price trends continue to be heavily influenced by a handful of places in Ontario and British Columbia and mask significant variations in local housing market trends and conditions across Canada," the industry group's president, Cliff Iverson, said in a news release.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto  </div><div>1474 words</div><div>11 August 2016</div><div>20:17</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing recovery that began in 2012 has lifted the overall market but left behind a broad swath of the middle class, threatening to create a generation of permanent renters and sowing economic anxiety and frustration for millions of Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose in 83% of the nation's 178 major real-estate markets in the second quarter, according to figures released Wednesday by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Overall prices are now just 2% below the peak reached in July 2006, according to S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most of the price gains, economists said, stem from a lack of fresh supply rather than a surge of buyers. The pace of new home construction remains at levels typically associated with recessions, while the homeownership rate in the second quarter was at its lowest point since the Census Bureau began tracking quarterly data in 1965 and the share of first-time home purchases remains mired near three-decade lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lopsided recovery has shut out millions of aspiring homeowners who have been forced to rent because of damaged credit, swelling student loans, tough credit standards and a dearth of affordable homes, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, some 200,000 to 300,000 fewer U.S. households are purchasing a new home each year than would during normal market conditions, estimates Ken Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center of Real Estate and Urban Economics at the <span class="companylink">University of California at Berkeley</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think we are in a normal housing market," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. "The losers are clearly the rising rental population that isn't able to participate in this housing equity appreciation. They are missing out on [a big] source of middle-class wealth."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anxiety about missed economic opportunities is a key driver of the anti-incumbent anger on both sides of the political spectrum that has shaken up the 2016 election season, helping fuel the insurgent presidential campaigns of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have these people who can't get housing, and it's turning into this rage," said Kevin Finkel, executive vice president at Philadelphia-based Resource Real Estate, which owns or manages 25,550 apartments around the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While economists expected the homeownership rate to begin edging up this year, the rate fell to a 51-year low of 62.9% in the second quarter from 63.4% in the same quarter last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate could fall to 58% or lower by 2050, according to a recent prediction by housing experts Arthur Acolin of the <span class="companylink">University of Southern California</span>, Laurie Goodman of the Urban Institute and Susan Wachter of the <span class="companylink">Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long-term declines could erase gains made by middle-class Americans since World War II. Owning a home provides protection against rising rents and has been a key component of retirement saving and wealth creation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The default savings mechanism for American households has been homeownership," Ms. Wachter said. "Today we have historic lows for young households in terms of ownership so they're not getting on this path."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, in turn, can ripple throughout the economy. Homeowners often use home equity to pay for college tuition, vacations or home renovations, all of which help boost consumer spending. The mere knowledge that home values are rising can make consumers comfortable spending money other places, a process known as the wealth effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're seeing a divide between the wealth of homeowners and the wealth of renters," said Nela Richardson, chief economist at real-estate brokerage firm Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After peaking in July 2006, the Case-Shiller index plunged 27% over the next six years. Since then the recovery has been swift, particularly in markets with strong job growth and limited supply, creating problems for entry-level buyers in particular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the country the recovery has been divided between strong West Coast markets and Texas, which have rebounded swiftly beyond their 2006 peaks, while prices from the Rust Belt to southern Florida may not return to those levels for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in the Boulder, Colo., metro area are 45% above their prior peak, while those in Dallas are 26% above their boom-time highs, according to data provider <span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span>. Meanwhile, prices in the Saginaw, Mich., area remain nearly 40% below their peak levels and those in Atlantic City are still 38% lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Sacramento, prices have jumped 64% since the beginning of 2012, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunny Kenner, a 40-year-old single mother who works for the county government and has rented for years, decided a few months ago she needed to buy before rising prices shut her out for good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kenner, who is looking for a two-bedroom house in the $250,000 range, has been trying for months but twice has been outbid by buyers with large cash reserves who bid $10,000 over the asking price. By the second day a house is on the market, she says, there are usually about half a dozen offers on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The first time I didn't get one of the houses, of course, I cried," she said. "The second time I was just numb." She said she wishes she had enough money to buy when prices hit bottom a few years ago. "I feel like I missed the boat."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main reason for falling homeownership, economists say: mortgage availability. Lenders chastened by the financial crisis have been fearful of making loans to borrowers with dings on their credit, student debt or credit-card bills, or younger buyers with shorter credit histories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm not sure that we'll see some of those conditions change in any material way in the foreseeable future," said Tim Mayopoulos, the president and chief executive officer of mortgage giant Fannie Mae, in an interview last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right now our mortgage finance system is still not working well for lower- and middle-income households and first-time buyers," added Mr. Rosen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dearth of home construction, especially at the lower end, is taking a toll. Nationally, the inventory of homes for sale has dropped more than 37% since 2011, according to Zillow, a real estate information firm. Some of that reflects the clearing away of distressed inventory, but economists said the pendulum has swung toward a housing shortage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimated 1 million new households were formed last year, but only 620,000 new housing units were built, according to the <span class="companylink">Urban Institute</span>. An analysis of census data by the <span class="companylink">Urban Institute</span> showed that all of the net new households formed between 2006 and 2014 were renters rather than owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006 home builders produced 40% more single-family homes than the 30-year long-run average. Last year, by contrast, single-family home construction was still 30% below that mark, according to Census Bureau data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We went so many years without building there are in many places in the country a shortage of housing," said Richard Green, the Lusk Chair in Real Estate at the <span class="companylink">University of Southern California</span>. "I think that overshadows everything else in terms of normalcy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the early years of the recovery only top earners could afford to buy homes, as new buyers struggled with joblessness or tarnished credit histories, so builders focused almost exclusively on the high-end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The entry-level buyer, up until recently, has not been that involved in buying houses," said Dale Francescon, co-chief executive of Century Communities, a publicly traded builder that operates in four states. "That's historically where a significant amount of the volume has come from."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as first-time buyers have started returning to the market, many builders have been slow to respond. Building lower-priced homes means finding cheaper land, and that tends to be farther away from job centers on the suburban fringes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those areas were the hardest hit during the housing bust, and many investors have been hesitant to encourage builders to return. As a result, builders have tended to focus on ever-dwindling and increasingly expensive land in core areas, pushing up the prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Farrell, director of business development for Landmark Capital Advisors, which counsels investors on real-estate projects, said risk appetite is low, particularly outside core markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're often saying 'You all want to be in the same spot, and you're tripping over each other," he said. "It's just difficult to get people out to those secondary markets."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second-quarter surge in home prices made San Jose, Calif., the first city where the price of a typical home eclipses $1 million, underscoring growing affordability concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Jose was the most expensive metropolitan area in the country, with a median home price of $1.085 million, followed by San Francisco at $885,600 and Anaheim-Santa Ana, Calif., at $742,200.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data released Wednesday by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> showed year-to-year increases in home prices in 83% of metropolitan areas across the country in the second quarter, only a slight decline from the first quarter, when increases were reported in 87% of metro areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there were some signs the market is starting to cool, bringing welcome relief for home buyers. Twenty-five out of the 178 metropolitan areas included in the report experienced double-digit price gains, down significantly from the same period last year, when 34 metro areas saw double-digit gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty-nine metro areas also experienced price declines this quarter, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, home prices hit records during the quarter, driven by rapidly rising prices in California and northwestern cities, such as Portland and Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median home price was $240,700, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>, up nearly 5% from the previous peak in the second quarter of 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling mortgage rates and modest income gains failed to improve housing affordability for average families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To purchase a single-family home at the national median price, a buyer making a 5% down payment would need an income of $52,255. During the same quarter last year, such a buyer would have needed to make just over $49,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many listings in a majority of markets -- and especially those in lower price ranges -- had multiple offers and went under contract quickly because of severely inadequate supply," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at NAR.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kim Mackrael and Wei Gu </div><div>983 words</div><div>10 August 2016</div><div>12:59</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its new residential-property tax on outsiders, Vancouver, British Columbia, is the latest locality trying to keep foreign buyers at bay. Tommy Li of Beijing is one of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, he said, his wife quit her job to accompany their now-12-year-old son to study in Vancouver. Mr. Li, who works for a U.S. technology company, stayed behind to support them. They bought an apartment for 400,000 Canadian dollars (US$304,900) earlier this year that was still under construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After British Columbia announced that starting Aug. 2, it would charge an additional transfer tax of 15% of a property's value to foreign buyers in Vancouver, Mr. Li needs to pay C$60,000 more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I understand where the policy comes from, since China's own overheated property market has also created many problems," Mr. Li said. "But we are not investors."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new tax is the latest move by governments from Singapore to Australia to try to limit the amount of foreign money coming into local real-estate markets to keep home prices from rising further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even as these measures proliferate, economists and others disagree about whether they are wise, or even effective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local policies such as the Vancouver tax may be blunted by global developments, including low interest rates that make for affordable mortgages, and, in China, a depreciating yuan and corruption crackdown that have made Chinese more eager to get their money out of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even if you think about, say, a 15% tax on property-related transactions, that may not be enough to deter a wealthy Chinese official or businessman who feels that his money is at risk in China," said Eswar Prasad, the New Century Chair in International Economics at <span class="companylink">Brookings Institution</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, it is difficult to say what impact the taxes have, because they often come as part of an array of measures that also can be responsible for shifts in housing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people find work-arounds, real-estate agents say, such as putting the property in a relative's name. And a tax on foreign buyers in one locale also could shift buying to another city. In Canada, some economists are warning the Vancouver tax move is likely to fuel more foreign buying to other cities including Toronto, where housing prices also have risen significantly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2013 Singapore boosted to 15% from 10% the fee added to the purchase price of residential property bought by many foreigners, including Chinese. In Hong Kong, mainland Chinese and foreign buyers also face a 15% tax, which was introduced in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in both localities have begun to cool. But in Singapore, the government also took other steps to cool the housing market around the same time as the foreign-buyer tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong, meanwhile, has increased minimum down payments and raised real-estate transaction taxes for luxury homes, among other moves—in addition to its tax for non-Hong Kong permanent residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After it introduced the cooling measures in 2012, transaction volumes tumbled by 70% in the following six months, government figures show, but prices continued to climb, setting new highs. That led to more taxes to thwart speculative home-buying by locals. The market started to soften last year, but has strengthened again this year after the U.K.'s vote to leave the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> led to expectations of more monetary easing globally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Christy Clark, premier of British Columbia, has said the new tax, as well as a separate vacancy tax on properties left unoccupied, is aimed at keeping homes affordable. The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said what it calculates as the benchmark price for a typical Vancouver home rose 33% in the year through July to C$930,400.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some think the new rules can work. "Price appreciation was bound to decelerate anyway, given how lofty prices have become, and how unaffordable most of the Vancouver market had become," said BMO Capital Markets' economist Sal Guatieri. But "this will certainly add some cooling pressure."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Clark said even if the new measure doesn't deter foreign investors, the government would receive a boost in tax revenue that it intends to dedicate to affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others say the governments should focus not on who is buying the property, but whether they are contributing to the local economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justin Fung, a member of a Vancouver group called Housing Action for Local Taxpayers, said he prefers a different approach than the one the government took. He backs proposals for a general property-tax surcharge that could be offset by a homeowner's regional or national income tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you were going to work hard, earn your living here in the city, and you're willing to do that, then you deserve to have an affordable home here," said Mr. Fung, who works in technology and grew up in Vancouver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fung, who owns a two-bedroom condominium in Vancouver where he lives with his wife and their young daughter, said his family considered upgrading to a larger home in recent years but quickly changed their minds when they realized how much more they would need to pay for a house or larger condo unit in their part of the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We actually ended up just getting priced out altogether," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Mr. Li, he said he will probably end up taking a larger mortgage and paying the tax, because he already made a down payment. Of Vancouver, he said: "I just want my son to have a place so that he can finish his studies."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">These Hong Kong Mortgage Deals May Be Too Sweet; Critics say some developers' cheap loans, meant to lure buyers, are more risky for borrowers</span>
</div><div class="author">By Dominique Fong and Anjie Zheng  </div><div>1016 words</div><div>9 August 2016</div><div>14:21</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Hong Kong home prices climb out of reach for many buyers, developers are rolling out easy money in hopes of winning sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a move reminiscent of the U.S. housing boom a decade ago, Hong Kong builders in recent months have been enticing buyers with mortgage deals covering as much as 123% of the price of new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts and the city's banking regulator have said the loans introduce more risk to borrowers and could delay a long overdue home price correction in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One recent weekend in Hong Kong, close to the mainland Chinese border, shuttles carried families from a shopping mall to one of the city's newest apartment blocks, Park Yoho Venezia. Crowds trickled into a foyer packed with real-estate agents and buyers hunched elbow-to-elbow over paperwork. Popcorn and ice cream were served.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May Tai, 56 years old, was tempted by one financing deal on the table: a 120% loan plan being offered by the developer <span class="companylink">Sun Hung Kai Properties</span>. The loan, which carried an interest rate initially lower than a bank mortgage, seemed appealing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the homes she toured, a one-bedroom apartment with an open kitchen, looked ideal to rent out for extra income amid a sluggish economy, she said. Although it appeared to be a good opportunity, she wasn't ready to make a deal that day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'll have to do the math," Ms. Tai said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loan plans are essentially short-term bridge loans at low interest rates for three years. After that, borrowers have to refinance—usually at higher rates—either from a bank or the developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, one financing offer for apartments at Park Yoho Venezia included loans with a 2.15% interest rate for the first three years, after which it would rise to 4% if the homeowner applied for another loan, according to Sun Hung Kai. Hong Kong banks typically offer mortgages with 2.3% rates these days, according to Jack Tong, a director at brokerage <span class="companylink">Savills Hong Kong</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers are touting the loans to boost sales, rather than slashing prices on new apartment complexes, which would hit their bottom lines more quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Sun Hung Kai Properties</span>, Hong Kong's largest developer by market value, and Cheung Kong Properties, headed by tycoon Li Ka-shing, have offered some of the most aggressive plans. In June, both gave potential buyers the option of a home-financing loan worth 120% and 123%, respectively, of a home's sale price at their new real-estate projects. The plans require having another home as collateral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong home affordability is a major point of dissatisfaction in the city. While property prices have tripled since 2003, inflation-adjusted wages have stagnated, according to <span class="companylink">UBS</span>, making it difficult for the average Hong Kong resident to afford housing. Research firm Demographia ranked Hong Kong the least affordable city in the world in 2016, with the median home price 19 times greater than median household incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government has repeatedly rolled out price-cooling measures, such as raising down-payment requirements. Yet the requirement to pay at least 40% of the value of a home upfront means many young people believe it is nearly impossible to own their own homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">The Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span>, the city's de facto central bank and regulator, mandates banks can grant mortgages worth up to 60% of the value of the property. But since the developers' loans are offered by their own financing units, they are able to skirt banking rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sun Hung Kai and Cheung Kong say the plans aim to help buyers looking to upgrade their homes while foregoing the strict financial scrutiny of a bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One result of the developers' loan plans is that buyers bear the brunt of the risk, says Mr. Tong of <span class="companylink">Savills Hong Kong</span>. Since the interest rate on the loans increases after three years, borrowers are betting the value of their home will hold up such that they can refinance or sell their home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Personally, I wouldn't be making those bets," Mr. Tong said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The danger is that buyers could get stuck with negative equity on their property—or owing more than the value of the home. In that case, selling the home or refinancing would be challenging, and the risk of foreclosure would increase. Already, the number of residential mortgage loans in negative equity surged to 1,307 cases at the end of June, compared with 95 cases at the end of December 2015, according to the HKMA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers' loans elicited words of caution from the HKMA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even though the short-term carrot may look attractive, potential buyers should take into account any changes that may occur in the future," said Arthur Yuen, HKMA's deputy chief executive in an online statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sun Hung Kai said its plan is "not intended to increase buyers' risk" since it allows buyers to dispose their previous properties through a bridging loan. Cheung Kong Properties didn't respond to requests for comment on the risks of their mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should developers continue to skirt bank mortgage rules and offer financing plans rather than cutting prices, Hong Kong home prices are likely to stay high, analysts say. Prices have picked up since March after having slipped 11% from a peak last September, according to the Centa-City Leading Index, compiled by Centaline Property Agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Although generally the market is softening, all these countermeasures from the developer help to slow down the decline in the pricing," said Joseph Tsang, managing director of real-estate brokerage firm JLL Hong Kong. "It helps to maintain the price at its [current] level, which is not healthy."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Rory Jones and Orr Hirschauge  </div><div>862 words</div><div>8 August 2016</div><div>19:47</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KFAR TAPUACH, West Bank—The first time Michal Ronen traveled to her rental apartment in this Jewish settlement in the occupied Palestinian territories, a firebomb struck her bus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was so hysterical," she said. "I thought that happens every time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Ms. Ronen and her husband are looking to buy a home in Kfar Tapuach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The eagerness of Israelis to own a home on disputed land is an increasingly important political and financial barrier to a comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian peace based on two neighboring states, critics of settlement expansion say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Israel has said that settlements aren't an impediment to a two-state solution because many of them could be exchanged for Israeli territory in a future deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are rising faster in many Jewish settlements than in major cities such as Jerusalem and Tel Aviv because of strong demand from Israeli home buyers. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government is increasing the incentives for settlers, despite objections from the U.S. and other world powers to expanding the settlements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Israel would almost certainly have to compensate settlers for moving from any land included in a future Palestinian state, according to researchers at the Tel Aviv-based Macro Center for Political Economics. That would amount to billions of dollars, depending on the number of settlers who had to relocate, the center estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 370,000 Jewish settlers live in the West Bank, and an additional 200,000 live in East Jerusalem on land Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 war, according to <span class="companylink">Peace Now</span>, a nongovernmental organization that monitors settlement construction. Israel recognizes 130 settlements in the West Bank, and considers roughly 100 other outposts of Jewish settlers in the West Bank illegal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The settler population is growing faster than the Israeli population as a whole. The Jewish population in the West Bank grew 25% in the five years through the end of 2014, compared with 10% in Israel, according to data from the country's Central Bureau of Statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But housing construction hasn't kept pace. Mr. Netanyahu has limited new construction in the larger West Bank settlements to a certain degree, under pressure from the Obama administration and the international community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, housing prices in some of the larger settlements have risen at a faster rate than in Israeli cities, according to data from the <span class="companylink">Israel Tax Authority</span> collected and analyzed by Mesilaty Haim Real Estate Appraisal Co. Ltd., an Israel-based real-estate firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market in the settlements also has been affected by a housing shortage in Israel, as contractors have built far fewer units than required to meet population growth in recent years, according to real-estate agents and an Israeli official.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Kfar Tapuach, where Ms. Ronen lives, the price of land has more than tripled in the past five years, according to data from Israel-based property website Madlan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A July report from the Quartet for the Middle East peace process, which comprises the <span class="companylink">U.N</span>., the U.S., Russia and the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>, criticized the settlements as one of the chief obstacles to peace between Israel and Palestinians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Netanyahu responded to the report, which came amid an increase in Palestinian violence against Israeli settlers, by approving construction of hundreds of new houses in East Jerusalem, where Palestinians want to establish a future capital, and the nearby West Bank settlement of Ma'ale Adumim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The West Bank appeals to Israelis because the houses are often larger, it is close to major cities, the schools are sometimes better and everyday life can be more affordable, according to real-estate agents. Some settlers are also ideologically driven to settle what they consider to be ancestral Jewish land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Settlements get financial support from the government for education, services and the like, above and beyond what goes to other local governments. That additional funding has increased 31% since Mr. Netanyahu's current administration came to power last year, to 18,000 shekels ($4,600) a year for each household, according to the Macro Center for Political Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Efrat, a settlement 10 miles south of Jerusalem, hundreds of people are on a waiting list to buy a home in the community, said Mayor Oded Revivi, who also serves as chief international liaison for the Yesha Council, a group that represents settlements. "Today, the majority of the population moved because of financial reasons," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents of Kfar Tapuach, a settlement of roughly 200 families near the Palestinian city of Nablus, said house prices have benefited from the growth of a university in the nearby settlement of Ariel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ronen said she and her husband, Yuval, moved to the settlement because Mr. Ronen studies engineering at the university. They live there with their three children. "We now really want to buy a house," she said, adding that they say it has to be now because prices are "going up crazy."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Stu Woo </div><div>914 words</div><div>8 August 2016</div><div>07:28</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a long push inspired by Silicon Valley, this centuries-old college town has taken on a new role as a modern, tech-industry hub.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reward has been a flood of jobs and money. The downsides have been the same sort of housing and traffic strains beleaguering the San Francisco Bay Area. Another, more recent complaint by some locals: Foreigners keep snapping up the best companies that have sprouted here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cambridge's tech bona fides were validated afresh last month when Japanese telecommunications giant <span class="companylink">SoftBank Group Corp</span>. agreed to pay $32 billion for <span class="companylink">ARM Holdings PLC</span>. The Cambridge firm designs the chips in more than 95% of the world's smartphones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That deal follows the acquisitions of other, well-known Cambridge-affiliated firms by some of America's tech titans. In 2011, <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span> paid $11 billion for <span class="companylink">Autonomy Corp</span>., an analytics-software developer that, at the time, was Britain's reigning tech darling. That deal ended in acrimony after <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span> accused it of fraud, an allegation Autonomy's founder is still fighting in court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, <span class="companylink">Alphabet Inc</span>.'s <span class="companylink">Google</span> in 2014 bought <span class="companylink">DeepMind Technologies Ltd</span>., a giant in the world of artificial intelligence. <span class="companylink">Microsoft Corp</span>. in February acquired SwiftKey, which designs smartphone keyboards that try to predict what a person is typing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm happy at some level to have great U.K. tech successes," said Andy Hopper, the head of the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. He was research director at Acorn Computers Ltd., which helped build ARM. On the other hand, he said he fears ARM will be vulnerable if SoftBank runs into tough times. SoftBank has pledged to double the size of ARM's 1,600-employee British workforce in five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a new potential challenge to Cambridge as a global tech hub: Brexit. Some industry players, including Mr. Hopper, worry the U.K.'s vote in June to leave the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>, could damp Cambridge's tech clout if it makes it harder for EU citizens to work in the U.K. At the same time British venture capitalists say the plummeting pound, a collateral effect of Brexit, may also make U.K. tech firms more attractive to foreign takeovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's recent tech offspring has helped Cambridge punch above its weight. It remains a minnow on the global stage in terms of startup funding, for instance, a key benchmark for cities aspiring to be the next Silicon Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venture-backed companies in the area raised $317 million in equity financing in the first half of 2016, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. By comparison, venture-backed companies in London raised $1.2 billion. Those in the Bay Area hauled in $9 billion over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Cambridge has become the pride of the U.K. tech industry, which dubs the area "Silicon Fen," a nod to both its budding computer-engineering sector and age-old marshes. About 57,000 people work at more than 1,500 local tech firms with a combined annual revenue of more than £13 billion ($17 billion), according to estimates from the <span class="companylink">University of Cambridge</span>, which has helped foster the tech boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founded in 1209, the <span class="companylink">University of Cambridge</span> is the English-speaking world's second-oldest university behind the <span class="companylink">University of Oxford</span>, which is about 100 years older. Over the centuries, the university here played host to a variety of innovators including physicists Isaac Newton and Stephen Hawking and poets John Milton and Lord Byron.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as <span class="companylink">Stanford University</span> helped spur Silicon Valley, the <span class="companylink">University of Cambridge</span> did the same starting in 1970. It used its lands and funds to establish the Cambridge Science Park to house and support high-tech businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They did look to Silicon Valley and Kendall Square" -- the area near the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> in that other Cambridge, outside Boston -- "as something to aspire to," said Tony Raven, chief executive of Cambridge Enterprise Ltd., a university initiative that helps faculty and students commercialize tech-startup ideas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The organization shares a building with IdeaSpace, an incubator and co-working space for Cambridge entrepreneurs, at the west end of campus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The university's tech initiatives paralleled the rise of local tech firms such as Sinclair Computers, founded in 1973, and ARM, founded in 1990, that took advantage of the brain power graduating from Cambridge every June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">London-based pharmaceutical giant <span class="companylink">AstraZeneca PLC</span> is in the midst of moving its global research-and-development center from near Manchester, England, to Cambridge, where it plans to have 2,000 employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Cambridge is experiencing classic boomtown stresses. The median price of a Cambridge house in the second quarter of 2015 was £360,000 (about $476,633 at current exchange rates), up 47% from £245,000 from the same period in 2010, according to government data. That outpaced rising prices in London. The median rental rate of a private-market, one-bedroom flat in Cambridge for the year ended September 2015 was £900 a month, the highest rate in England outside London, according to government data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eben Upton, founder of the nonprofit <span class="companylink">Raspberry Pi Foundation</span>, known for its $5 computers, said the 10-mile, rush-hour drive to his central Cambridge office takes 45 minutes, or just five minutes less than cycling. "There's a need for some sort of plausible transportation strategy," Mr. Upton said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Todd Buell </div><div>419 words</div><div>8 August 2016</div><div>03:58</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRANKFURT—German industrial output was slightly stronger than expected in June, data from the country's economy ministry showed Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Output rose by 0.8% in monthly adjusted terms. This beat expectations of 0.7% growth in a survey by The Wall Street Journal. Manufacturing output was up by 1.5%, while construction output declined by 0.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The increase, however, comes too late to make a disappointing quarter for the German industry a good one," said ING economist Carsten Brzeski.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong June was a robust end for German industry to what was a rather weak quarter, with output declining by 1% versus the first three months of the year, the ministry said in an accompanying statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outlook for the coming months is somewhat unclear. Data released on Friday showed manufacturing orders in Germany having declined unexpectedly in June[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/german-manufacturing-data-point-to-sluggish-economy-1470384153], which generally wouldn't bode well for production figures. "With orders having come in rather weak recently, a sideways movement is the most that can be expected for the coming months, and it is even likely that a minus will be reported for July," said Ralph Solveen of <span class="companylink">Commerzbank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet not all are so downbeat. "Although factory orders data has been weak recently, survey data generally paint a more favorable picture of the economy. Therefore, we see a good chance that production in July increases further," said Matthias Thiel, an economist at BNP Paribas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The German economy is expected to have slowed considerably in the second quarter after strong, but unsustainable, growth in the first quarter. The country's statistics office will release a preliminary estimate on Friday. Experts see Europe's largest economy having grown 0.2% compared with the first quarter, when the economy expanded by 0.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Despite some resilience in recent survey data Brexit will ultimately weigh on GDP growth," said Mr. Thiel, adding that quarterly growth should float around a range of 0.2% to 0.3% on the quarter in the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All in all, today's industrial production data take away some fears of a hard landing of the German economy in the second quarter," said Mr. Brzeski.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Chris Kirkham </div><div>496 words</div><div>5 August 2016</div><div>20:20</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prices home builders pay for single-family lots hit a record high in the U.S. last year, a sign that a scarce supply of developed land is pushing up the cost of new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median single-family lot prices were $45,000 last year, surpassing the previous peak of $43,000 at the height of the housing boom in 2006, according to an analysis of the most recent census data by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dynamics of this expansion, however, are far different from a decade ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for developed lots in 2006 were driven up by record levels of demand: Buyers had easy access to credit and builders rushed to deliver as many new homes as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, there is more caution. Builders last year began construction on 714,500 single-family homes, less than half as many as in 2006. That suggests lot prices today are being pushed up by low inventories of developed land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders responding to a national housing-market survey in May reported the lowest supply of lots since the survey started in 1997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said developers who acquire land have tried to avoid bringing too much supply to the market ahead of demand. "That pipeline has not opened, has not provided as much supply as the market can bear," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dietz said higher regulatory costs for lot development also contribute to the rise in prices. His group found a 19% increase in such costs between 2011 and 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have hit record highs even as the typical lot has been shrinking. Median lot sizes for single-family homes last year dropped to 8,589 square feet, the lowest since the Census started consistently tracking the data in the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of that reflects changing preferences of both home buyers and builders, who so far in the recovery have tended to cluster more in core urban and suburban markets where land is less plentiful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don Donnelly, co-owner of Hedgewood Homes in Atlanta, used to focus on suburban development before the housing crash but has since moved almost exclusively to smaller-lot homes in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a year-and-a-half ago, he said, he purchased land for a 120-home development in a central part of Atlanta for about $1 million an acre. Now, land in the same area is going for double that amount, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the higher price tag for the land, Mr. Donnelly said he has to think smaller to keep home prices in check for potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Really the only way to stay affordable is to increase the density and reduce the size of the houses," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Chris Kirkham   </div><div>952 words</div><div>5 August 2016</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With median home prices in San Francisco hovering near $1 million, developers are looking to the far reaches of the Bay Area and beyond in search of affordable land on which to build.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And buyers are taking the plunge, sometimes in places as distant as Sacramento, more than 80 miles from the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year, the East Bay, which stretches 10 to 60 miles to the east of San Francisco and Silicon Valley, is tied for the fastest growth in new-home developments among major U.S. markets. Sacramento came in at No. 3, according to figures from John Burns Real Estate Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, the number of new residential developments in coastal San Francisco and San Mateo counties fell by 48% over the past year, while San Jose, which includes Silicon Valley, fell by 59%, according to the data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expensive and increasingly scarce land has made it difficult for developers to build houses most people can afford in the core Bay Area. Among all U.S. counties with populations over 500,000, the 10 most expensive for home purchases include five in the Bay Area, according to data company RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Bay Area has kind of reached uncharted territory. It's just nuts," said Greg Gross, a regional director for housing research firm Metrostudy, who focuses on northern California and Nevada. "I hate to use the word 'bubble,' but the pricing is just unreal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Maloney now commutes to the Bay Area every week from his home east of Sacramento, a nearly 120-mile journey across six counties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his family used to live in Marin County, across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco, but they grew tired of the congestion. Two years ago, they moved into a new 4,600-square-foot house on 3 acres for $920,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The house is bigger, the lot is bigger. We have a giant pool surrounded by palm trees," he said. "We can't get that kind of environment anywhere close in to the Bay Area. It's just not available anymore."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Bay Area builders are still nursing wounds from the housing crash, when far-flung California markets such as Stockton, Vallejo and Sacramento skyrocketed on loose lending and speculative fever -- only to plummet in an epic bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the pace of new construction in faraway suburbs is quickening, it is coming off historically low levels. Housing starts in areas such as Solano County, home to Fairfield and Vacaville, remain nearly 40% below the levels of a decade ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But unlike the early years of the recovery, when builders focused mainly on premium homes in pricier core locations, local and national builders in the Bay Area are trying out these more distant markets in the hope they can attract buyers who can't afford sky-high prices in coastal cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend is more pronounced in the Bay Area than in other parts of the country because of the extreme price pressures over the past few years. The Bay Area has had some of the swiftest job growth in the country and among the lowest unemployment rates of any major metropolitan area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are signs that demand for higher-end homes is slowing: Median sales prices for new single-family homes in San Francisco fell in both May and June, though prices were down from a record high of $1.5 million in April, according to data from <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're talking about one of the most expensive housing markets in the country," said Chris Apostolopoulos, the northern California division president for KB Home. "So any time you can provide affordable new homes and developments to a consumer base, you're going to do well."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Publicly traded builders TriPointe Group Inc. and <span class="companylink">CalAtlantic Group Inc</span>. are selling in Vacaville, about 55 miles northeast of downtown San Francisco, while <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>. are promoting developments in Manteca, 75 miles east of the city in California's Central Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meg Gore, a vice president of the Sacramento division for <span class="companylink">Taylor Morrison Inc</span>., said she has seen more purchases by both commuters seeking affordability and retirees looking to cash out of the Bay Area and get more space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a home builder and land developer, Gregg Nelson of Trumark Cos. has seen firsthand how demand has shifted outward in the recovery. Coming out of the recession, the company largely focused on condominium projects and land deals in the core San Francisco and Silicon Valley markets. But in the past three years they have begun work on two larger single-family home developments on the periphery -- one 40 miles east of San Francisco, the other 80 miles east.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The closer project is in Dublin, a fast-growing suburb that is adjacent to the easternmost stop on the <span class="companylink">Bay Area Rapid Transit</span> line. Homes there will start at under $900,000 and range above $1.5 million -- not affordable compared with most any other U.S. market, but lower-priced than new-home developments closer to the city that can start at $1.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project farther east, in Manteca, is just now getting off the ground, and its homes are expected to start at about $350,000. Most builders wouldn't have dreamed of venturing out so far two years ago, Mr. Nelson said, but nowadays the calculation is changing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"More and more builders are looking for ways to bring up their involvement into lower-cost areas," he said. "But everybody is still a little bit nervous about having too much."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Art Patnaude </div><div>420 words</div><div>4 August 2016</div><div>08:16</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">London has been knocked from its perch as the world's most expensive city to live and work in after Britain's vote to leave the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.K. capital is now third behind New York and Hong Kong, according to research on global cities from property broker Savills. The research examines the costs for an employee to live in rented housing and work in an office for a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">London had spent the last 2½ years at the top. But it fell in July because of the drop in sterling against the dollar and cooling U.K. real-estate markets[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/london-luxury-house-prices-keep-falling-after-brexit-vote-1470229733], both of which accelerated after the <span class="companylink">EU</span> referendum in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Brexit has made London more competitive, at least in terms of cost," said Yolande Barnes, head of world research at <span class="companylink">Savills</span>. "Of course, other factors might mean it won't be."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following years of booming property values, London commercial real-estate prices have been falling, after having slowed before Brexit, while house prices in expensive neighborhoods have been declining for more than a year. Meanwhile, in New York real-estate rents have increased marginally, Ms. Barnes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total accommodation costs in New York for one employee over a year were $114,010 in July, up 2% from December last year, the data show. The cost in Hong Kong was up 1% to $100,984. London costs fell 11% to $100,141.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December of last year, "New York was nipping at the heels of London. They were virtually on par," Ms. Barnes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tokyo climbed to fourth on the list, with accommodation costs rising 22% to $85,334, the report said. A significant strengthening of the yen amplified rising rents in both offices and prime housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is important for Tokyo," Ms. Barnes said, noting property values in the Japanese capital are heavily affected by income provided by rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Savills</span> research focused on accommodation costs for employees in financial-services and creative industries, which are major drivers of the economies of global cities, Ms. Barnes said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward Navarro, a former telephone clerk on the <span class="companylink">New York Stock Exchange</span>, has been facing foreclosure on his attached two-family house in Woodhaven, Queens, since 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, the 69-year-old had yet another day in court, his 12th in 14 months. While he was there, more than 200 people gathered in a nearby room, as court-appointed referees rapidly auctioned off 16 foreclosed properties, most of them modest homes like his.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The foreclosure crisis that gripped the U.S. since 2008 has eased in many states, but it has persisted in New York and New Jersey because of the slow pace of their foreclosure processes through the courts. New Jersey, with 6.2% of its home mortgages in foreclosure in the first quarter of 2016, ranked first in the country, followed by New York with 4.6%, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now there are signs of change. The number of pending foreclosures in New York City fell 5.8% in the first half of 2016, a steeper drop than in any full year since 2008, according to court-system data. In Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester counties, the number of pending cases fell 14% over the same period, the largest decline recorded in those regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Jersey, new foreclosure filings fell 28% in the first half of year compared with the same period in 2015, according to court-system data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in foreclosures has been attributed to several factors, from an improving economy, to speedier courts that are cutting down the backlog, to rising property values that prompted lenders to move more quickly with auctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Brooklyn, which had the biggest backlog in New York state in 2012, judges were told by court administrators to limit the number of settlement conferences if there was no sign of progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then in January, Justice Lawrence Knipel, the administrative judge for civil cases in Supreme Court in Brooklyn, ordered 6,000 foreclosure cases that had been handled by more than 20 judges to be turned over to a single judge. In an interview, he said that some judges had been reluctant to move the cases forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Who wants to sign foreclosures? Not many people," he said. "Judges were taking their time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the bubbling real-estate market is driving up home values even in lower-priced New York neighborhoods with many foreclosures, such as Jamaica. Average New York City home prices rose 10% in the second quarter from the same quarter a year ago, according to the Real Estate Board of New York, to a new high. In Queens, average home prices rose 9% over the same period, and they were up 7% in Jamaica.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study by <span class="companylink">PropertyShark.com</span>, which tracks foreclosures in New York City, found 673 New York City properties scheduled for auction for the first time during the second quarter, a 33% increase from the year-ago period. The biggest increase was in the Bronx, followed by Queens and Brooklyn. That upward trend continued into July: In Queens, first-time auctions were up 58% from July 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jacob Inwald, director of foreclosure prevention for Legal Services NYC, a nonprofit providing legal assistance to low-income communities, said that for years, when home values fell, lenders "had no particular incentives to foreclose," since that would make them responsible for a property's upkeep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, he said, "there are profits to be had."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory Schatz, president of the Mortgage Bankers Association, said strong property values could be a factor in the stepped-up pace in foreclosure auctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the delay, however, was caused by the deluge of cases during the economic downturn, he said. They overwhelmed judges, leading to scheduling delays, as well as delays generated by homeowners who failed to show up for hearings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of slow-moving cases, they are now moving faster, said Raymond Radow, a lawyer who specializes in foreclosure defense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is streamlined," he said. "We used to get mired in the weeds, where you are looking at every single 'i' and 't.' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Navarro's 2 1/2-story house on 75th Street had been in his family since the 1920s. He got into trouble on his $400,000 mortgage after he lost his job more than a decade ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A foreclosure was filed in 2009, stalled in 2010 and discontinued in 2013, according to court records. Last year a new foreclosure was filed after the debt was assigned to another entity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working with his lawyer, Robert J. Seewald of JASA Legal Services for the Elderly in Queens, Mr. Navarro is prepared to give up his house to the bank, under a federal program that would provide him with some money to cover his relocation costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lender contended that Mr. Navarro wasn't eligible, and the hearing ended with a warning from the hearing officer, Tracy Catapano-Fox, that the lender was required to negotiate in good faith. Another hearing was scheduled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Afterward, Mr. Navarro said that in any event he would be leaving New York. "One can't stay in New York for what I get from Social Security," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">How Much Does ‘Walkability' Affect Home Prices? The sale price of a home rose for every additional point on a scale of pedestrian friendliness, but not as much at the luxury end, a new study shows</span>
</div><div class="author">By Leigh Kamping-Carder  </div><div>421 words</div><div>3 August 2016</div><div>11:13</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stroll-friendly communities may be the latest housing draw [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/why-some-suburbs-are-trying-to-be-more-like-cities-1461550070], but in the luxury market, the "walkability premium" is relatively small.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Redfin, a Seattle-based real-estate brokerage, measured the effect of walkability [https://www.redfin.com/blog/2016/08/how-much-is-a-point-of-walk-score-worth.html] on home values by looking at increases in Walk Score, a 0-to-100 scale [http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/numbers/how-walkable-is-your-neighborhood-379/] that tallies things such as population density and nearby restaurants, schools and stores. A score above 90 is considered a "walker's paradise" where almost all errands can be done on foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price of a home in the markets surveyed rose 0.9%, or $3,250, for a one-point gain in Walk Score. For luxury homes—defined as the priciest 5%—the premium was just 0.55%, or $6,800, the Redfin data show. The numbers were based on sales from January 2014 to April 2016 in 14 markets where Redfin has comprehensive data. (Other factors could affect price.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premium is smaller at the luxury end because in areas like the Midwest, Texas and parts of California, buyers covet square footage and acreage, said Nela Richardson, Redfin's chief economist. "Luxury doesn't mean downtown."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Atlanta, a one-point increase in Walk Score had the biggest payoff, adding 1.69% to home prices overall and 0.94% to luxury-home prices. While Atlanta has gotten more pedestrian-friendly in recent years, many neighborhoods still lack walkable streets and retail options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meredith Leapley paid $1.1 million in June for a two-bedroom at 1065 Midtown, a 52-unit condo-hotel in Atlanta near Piedmont Park and public transit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orange County, Calif., was the only market where walkability hurt high-end home values: The median sale price of a luxury home fell 0.03% for an extra Walk Score point. Across the market, the premium was 0.02%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many luxury buyers in the area favor exclusivity and privacy more than proximity to services, said Vickie Melin, an Irvine, Calif.-based Redfin agent. For some, neighboring stores bring unwanted noise, and ample parking makes it easy to run errands by car, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Melin is listing a 12,000-square-foot home in Villa Park, Calif., for $3.788 million. The gated estate sits on two-thirds of an acre on a hillside. The Walk Score: 0.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Art Patnaude </div><div>498 words</div><div>3 August 2016</div><div>09:08</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-end house prices in central London have continued to fall after Britain's vote to leave [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/housing-market-may-be-brexits-best-bellwether-1470155623?tesla=y]the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>, according to property broker Knight Frank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Home prices [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-ks-housing-market-feels-effects-of-european-union-leave-vote-1468450862]in prime central London were down 1.5% in July from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of London luxury homes has been falling since the market peaked in the summer of 2014, with investors balking at tax rises after years of soaring prices. Foreign investors that helped drive prices higher during the boom also have been contending with weaker currencies and stock market volatility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vote in June to leave the <span class="companylink">EU</span> was "a trigger to make overdue reductions to asking prices," said Tom Bill, head of London residential research at Knight Frank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A standoff on price between buyers and sellers has contributed to a collapse in the number of transactions in London's ultrawealthy neighborhoods during the past year. While it is too early to see a broad effect from Brexit on sale prices, the current reductions "reflect what would have been an appropriate price before the referendum," Mr. Bill said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some prime neighborhoods have suffered more than others. In Knightsbridge, prices were down 7.3% in July on the year, Chelsea prices were 7.2% lower and Notting Hill fell 3.7%. Prices in Mayfair, which suffered prices declines over the past year, were up 0.8% in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cooling prices go beyond central London. The housing market across the U.K. slowed this year ahead of the referendum. Buyers and sellers uncertain over the outcome held back, pushing the number of transactions lower and slowing price growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vote to leave the <span class="companylink">EU</span> created fresh uncertainty, with the U.K. now needing to negotiate the terms of its exit, a process that could take years. In such a climate, analysts expect the housing slowdown to continue for at least the rest of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial property has so far taken the biggest hit after the <span class="companylink">EU</span> referendum. Real-estate funds had to halt trading to stem outflows from investors asking for their money back. Share prices of major office landlords fell sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts have warned that housing market could be at risk of an even greater drop in prices. Property brokers that earn commission from house sales have warned that 2016 profits will be weaker than last year due to Brexit-led uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In prime central London, sales volumes are down around 15% from last year, and the number of new prospective buyers was lower in the first half of 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But strong viewing numbers "have given confidence regarding future sales volumes," Mr. Bill said. However, at this point it is too early to say whether the asking-price reductions "are likely to trigger higher transaction levels."</p>

</div><div class="author">By James Glynn </div><div>589 words</div><div>2 August 2016</div><div>01:48</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SYDNEY—<span class="companylink">Australia's central bank</span> cut interest rates Tuesday, responding to record-low inflation and a slowing jobs market, while playing down the risks of fanning house-price growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of Australia</span> reduced its cash rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 1.5%, the first cut since May[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/reserve-bank-of-australia-cuts-benchmark-rate-1462250176]. The result was expected, with financial markets pricing in a roughly 66% chance of a cut before the decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The board judged that prospects for sustainable growth in the economy, with inflation returning to target over time, would be improved by easing monetary policy at this meeting," central bank Gov. Glenn Stevens said in an accompanying statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Official figures last week showed core annual inflation hit 1.5% in the second quarter[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/australian-inflation-rises-in-line-with-expectations-1469585299], well below the RBA's 2% to 3% target band. Policy makers worry low inflation could feed into wage and price-setting behaviors of businesses and households. Current central-bank forecasts don't have inflation returning to the band until mid-2018 at the earliest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australia created roughly 7,000 jobs a month on average this year, compared with more than 30,000 a month in the second half of 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Australian dollar fell roughly half a cent after the decision to US$0.75. The local currency has been stubbornly high in recent months, hurting services-exports industries such as tourism and education that have been helping the economy transition away from a reliance on mining to drive growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the latest commentary by the RBA focused on the housing market and diminished concerns around lower interest rates fanning another surge in property prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Supervisory measures have strengthened lending standards in the housing market. Separately, a number of lenders are also taking a more cautious attitude to lending in certain segments," Mr. Stevens said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a considerable supply of apartments scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years, house prices should be contained, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All this suggests that the likelihood of lower interest rates exacerbating risks in the housing market has diminished," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australian cities like Sydney have some of the highest house prices[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/worry-over-debt-as-australian-house-prices-rise-1430207189] in the world, and concerns about fueling fresh price gains have acted as a deterrent to interest-rate cuts in recent years. Banks have been subjected to much tighter lending criteria in recent years to take some of the heat out of housing, especially in investor lending[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/australian-banks-tighten-mortgage-lending-requirements-for-foreigners-1461055560].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CoreLogic July Home Value Index this week showed a 0.8% rise in July from June, with prices up 6.1% from a year earlier. A few years ago, house prices were growing at around twice that pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The RBA was also conscious of the fact that failure to lower interest rates might result in a stronger Australian dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stevens said the country is adjusting from a reliance on mining at the end of a long resources boom, "though an appreciating exchange rate could complicate this."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Paul Dales, chief economist at Capital Economics, said the big change in the RBA's message is that it is now less concerned about housing-market risks. "That suggests the RBA could be prepared to lower interest rates even further," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Gabriele Parussini </div><div>1171 words</div><div>31 July 2016</div><div>21:27</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MALAPPURAM, India—Chronically low oil prices are disrupting a critical financial lifeline across Asia and depriving economies of much-needed hard currency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flow of cash, or remittances, from Asian citizens working in the Gulf soared when the price of oil was high, boosting growth across the board. The billions of dollars in annual inflows paid for necessities such as schooling and health care and helped propel families into the middle class for the first time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that money is disappearing, perhaps permanently, as laborers lose work in oil-driven Mideast countries. That's adding a new threat to growth in some Asian nations and depriving them of currency inflows they need to balance their national accounts and keep their currencies from depreciating too quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A barrel of <span class="companylink">Nymex</span> crude is now trading at around $41, up from below $30 earlier this year[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/oil-prices-fall-below-30-a-barrel-1452853918]. But prices are a long way from the peak of the boom and aren't expected to return to previous highs soon. In February 2014, a barrel of crude cost more than $100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demonstrating the pressures of sustained low prices, thousands of Indian workers protested in Saudi Arabia on Saturday at being left without jobs, pay and food after they were laid off. The Indian government stepped in over the weekend to hand out food to hungry workers[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/india-rushes-to-expat-workers-aid-in-saudi-arabia-1469985090].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A drop-off in funds from migrant workers contributed to a crisis in Sri Lanka that forced the government to take a $1.5 billion emergency loan[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/sri-lanka-gets-1-5-billion-loan-from-imf-1461941817] from the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> earlier this year. Falling inflows to Nepal, where transfers from overseas workers are equivalent to about 28% of annual national economic output, are undercutting the impoverished Himalayan country's ability to rebuild from earthquakes last year[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/nepal-earthquake-rescuers-hunt-for-survivors-as-death-toll-rises-1430032637].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weaker remittances are also making it tougher for India to provide jobs for the millions of youngsters that join the workforce each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a new normal" for countries that relied on riches transferred from the Gulf, said Dilip Ratha, a World Bank economist who studies migrant labor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such funds totaled $64.7 billion in South Asia in 2015, in what appears to be the high-water mark, up from $36.6 billion five years earlier, according to the <span class="companylink">World Bank</span>. Although <span class="companylink">World Bank</span> data for the first part of 2016 isn't available for all countries, initial figures from elsewhere show sharp declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remittances from the Gulf to Bangladesh, where funds from workers abroad add up to more than 15% of gross domestic product, dropped 4.1% in the 12 months ending in May compared with the same period a year earlier, according to the country's central bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philippine authorities say money flows from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are down 6% in recent months. Sri Lanka, India and Nepal have also reported declines from the Gulf in recent months or in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some countries, such as the Philippines, are picking up remittances from other sources to offset the declines. Many in South Asia aren't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remittances continue to grow across all developing countries largely due to a relatively strong U.S. economy, which sends large amounts of money to Latin America[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/remittances-to-latin-america-caribbean-hit-68-3-billion-in-2015-1455598863] and elsewhere. However, the 0.4% increase in remittances to developing countries last year was the weakest since 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while <span class="companylink">World Bank</span> economists expect the global picture to improve somewhat this year as the U.S. economy keeps expanding, Gulf money may never be replaced as its countries restructure to become less dependent on foreign labor[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/saudi-arabias-cabinet-approves-economic-reform-package-1465252667].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Saudi Arabia's largest construction companies, Saudi Binladin, has laid off 50,000 workers, mostly Asians, according to a person familiar with the company. A Saudi Binladin official confirmed restructuring was under way but didn't comment further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">M. Niyas, who worked as a carpenter in the Gulf for three years, moved back to Malappuram in the southwest Indian state of Kerala in December, after Saudi Arabia tightened restrictions on foreign workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His income has fallen from about $540 a month to around $180. Mr. Niyas, 31 years old, said he has given up on his dream of buying a car. He drives a beat-up scooter and worries about earning enough money to send his 3-year-old son to school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The good days are gone," Mr. Niyas said. "Now we have to make do with what's available here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Malappuram, houses and other buildings begun when families were flush with remittances stand half-finished. Shamil Khan, who owns a furniture shop, says sales have fallen by half. It's the same at a nearby appliance store, says owner K. Devdas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everything here is dependent on Gulf money," says N.P. Hafiz Mohamed, a sociologist at the University of Calicut. "Gulf money pays for the house, the car, the daughter's wedding. When it stops, everything stops."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, India is still expected to have the fastest-growing major economy[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/indias-economic-growth-picks-up-pace-accelerating-to-7-6-1464701307] in the world this year, driven by a booming services sector. But growth would be stronger if not for the remittances problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower oil prices have forced Gulf countries to rethink the way their economies function. For years, Gulf countries plowed oil profits into construction projects, passed along subsidies to their people and became reliant on foreigners to do an increasing share of the actual work. Economists say that model is no longer sustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ratings firm <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> says weaker remittances will affect the creditworthiness of recipient countries by undercutting their balance of payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sri Lanka's current-account deficit was equal to 2.4% of gross domestic product last year. Without remittances from the Gulf and elsewhere, it would have been 11.1%, according to a calculation by <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>. A bigger current-account deficit can accelerate currency depreciation, increase inflation and force higher interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With the collapse in oil prices, remittances flattened," said Sri Lanka's former central bank governor, Arjuna Mahendran, contributing to Sri Lanka's decision to seek help from the <span class="companylink">IMF</span>. "We need a safety net."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The sputtering U.S. economic recovery is causing worry about the expansion's durability, as sliding business investment drags on growth fueled by consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department's report on gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the U.S., showed annual growth of just 1.2% in the second quarter on a seasonally and inflation-adjusted basis, well below economists' projections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic growth is now tracking at a 1% rate in 2016 -- the weakest start to a year since 2011 -- when combined with a downwardly revised reading for the first quarter. That makes for an annual average rate of 2.1% growth since the end of the recession, the weakest pace of any expansion since at least 1949.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The output figures released Friday are in some ways discordant with other economic gauges. The unemployment rate stands at 4.9% after a streak of strong job gains, wages have begun to pick up and home sales hit a postrecession high in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending also remains strong. Personal consumption, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic output, expanded at a 4.2% rate in the second quarter, the best gain since late 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the downside, the third straight quarter of reduced business investment, a large paring of inventories and declining government spending cut into those gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Weakness in business investment is an important and lingering growth constraint," said Gregory Daco, an economist at Oxford Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Daco and other economists expect growth to accelerate in the third quarter, but the weak first half means 2016 is likely to come in below an already disappointing trend. In another worrisome sign, S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to report their fourth straight quarter of declining profits, down 3.7% from second-quarter 2015, according to a <span class="companylink">Thomson Reuters</span> survey of analysts' forecasts. Revenues are expected to decline 1.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> lowered on Friday its projected risk of a recession over the next 12 months to 30%, from an expansion high of 37% in early July, shortly after the U.K.'s vote to leave the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>, pointing to upwardly revised corporate profit data included in the GDP report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lackluster growth could spill into a presidential campaign that is revolving around starkly different portrayals of the U.S. economy and the well-being of average workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's figures could also raise new concerns to <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> officials who said last week near-term risks had diminished, signaling they might move to raise interest rates later this year, and possibly as early as September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan said Friday the Fed has to be cautious about raising rates at a time when growth is still sluggish. "We now need structural reforms and other fiscal policy," he said. "Then we will have more operating room where we can normalize rates."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, San Francisco Fed President John Williams said Friday underlying figures in the GDP report were encouraging. "We'll be raising rates, not lowering them, over the next several years," he said. He didn't offer specific timing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A paring of inventories was a major driver of weak output figures, subtracting 1.16 percentage points from overall growth. That could suggest businesses aren't optimistic about future demand. But the category is volatile, and rebuilding of stockpiles could support growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High inventories and soft export demand are weighing on <span class="companylink">United Parcel Service Inc</span>.'s business-to-business shipments, the company told investors Friday. That stands in contrast to a healthy U.S. consumer market lifting its e-commerce business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Inventories are lingering longer than we thought," Chief Executive David Abney said. "The strength of the U.S. dollar is not really helping us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies also spent less on buildings and equipment this spring. Nonresidential fixed investment, a measure of business spending, declined at a 2.2% pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a concern because capital expenditures are an important ingredient in improving employee productivity, which has grown at an anemic pace in recent years, but is critical to workers' wages and corporate profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers especially have been challenged by a strong dollar, which boosts the price of U.S.-made goods overseas. The energy industry has also been constrained, with relatively low oil and natural gas prices curtailing investments in mining and wells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases businesses may be substituting labor for capital, given depressed wage growth around the globe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Instead of buying an expensive piece of machinery, businesses are hiring really cheap workers they can fire whenever they want," said Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She noted that companies are also increasing dividends and buying back stock rather than investing in capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The presidential election is on the minds of some firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales at Pennsylvania-based restaurant chain <span class="companylink">Saladworks</span> are up almost 10% from a year earlier, but Chief Executive Patrick Sugrue said some of his best performing franchisees are reluctant to open new stores until after November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The election cycle puts everyone on hold," he said. "They want to get a better peek under the tent at what's going on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the nine-month long slowdown in output growth extends further, the U.S. could join Europe and Japan as economies struggling to achieve anything more than the most modest growth. On an annualized basis, second-quarter growth in the eurozone was also 1.2%, a slowdown from 2.2% the prior period, <span class="companylink">Eurostat</span> said Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest U.S. figures don't capture much, if any, effect from the U.K.'s Brexit decision because the vote took place during the final days of the quarter, which ended June 30. But uncertainty in Europe could add to caution among companies around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Looking beyond 2016, we continue to see macroeconomic uncertainty and pressures," United Technologies Corp. Chief Financial Officer Akhil Johri told investors this week. He noted Brexit and a strong U.S. dollar as concerns for the conglomerate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shelter Island, N.Y., Home Asks Record $32 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A waterfront Victorian estate on Shelter Island, N.Y., will list for $32 million, a likely record for the quiet vacation town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the property gets close to asking price, it will dwarf the current sales record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most expensive single-family residential sale on the island was a roughly 5,100-square-foot home for $9.5 million in 2014, according to the Shelter Island assessor's office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price "is unheard of for Shelter Island," said Beate Moore of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, who has the listing. "But we're not worried about it, because it's a world-class property."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owner, Dick Tarlow, 75, is a retired advertising-agency executive known for his work for clients such as <span class="companylink">Revlon</span> and Ralph Lauren.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roughly 4.8-acre property includes a 7,000-square-foot, Victorian-style home built around 1890. The seven-bedroom, six-bathroom home has nine original, wood-burning fireplaces and wraparound porches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property also has a tennis court, basketball court, pool, an 80-foot dock and boathouse. A nest of osprey have made their home near his boathouse, overlooking the Peconic Bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tarlow bought the home in 1983 with his then-wife, the late ad executive Sandy Carlson Tarlow, for $640,000, which he says was a record at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He undertook a major renovation in 2007 to modernize the home and to convert a windmill on the property into a lofted guesthouse. Last year, he replaced about 80 windows on the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tarlow is selling the property to split the proceeds among his three children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his wife, Kristin Kehrberg, will move to a contemporary home he owns next door. He says he'll miss the tennis court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sprawling South Carolina</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estate Hits the Market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chelsea Plantation, a 5,892-acre South Carolina estate owned by heirs to two American business empires, is on the market for $32.775 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1937, Marshall Field III, an heir to the Marshall Field department store fortune who became a major publisher, bought the property and built a grand, 7,700-square-foot main house with six bedrooms. He died in 1956.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1994, Nelson Doubleday Jr., of the Doubleday publishing family, who served as president of Doubleday and Co. and later was co-owner of the <span class="companylink">New York Mets</span>, bought a 43.75% share in the plantation. He built a 3,300-square-foot, three-bedroom house in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Doubleday Jr. was a longtime friend of the Field family, and the two families shared everything on the plantation, down to the shotguns, said Mr. Field V, a grandson of Mr. Field III who bought the estate in 1989.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between Savannah, Ga., and Charleston, S.C., the plantation includes 7.5 miles of river- and marshfront, said listing agent Chip Hall of Plantation Services in Charleston and Albany, Ga. The property includes a manager's house, eight workman's houses, stables, a farm office and equipment sheds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Doubleday Jr.'s death last year precipitated the sale, said his son-in-law, John Havens. Mr. Field V, 75, said he has opted to sell in accordance with the Doubleday family's wishes, though he would consider a new partner "if we could find someone suitable." In that case, the Doubleday portion would be sold for 43.75% of the list price.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 15,000-square-foot modernist home in Beverly Hills is hitting the market fully furnished for $48 million; the Picasso in the gallery is negotiable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
John Saca, a Sacramento-based commercial real-estate developer, bought the 1.1-acre property through a limited-liability company for $8.5 million in 2013, according to public records. He tore down an existing craftsman home, once owned by actor James Woods, to build this "modern barn"-inspired compound as an investment property. The architect was Christopher J. Bonura of Bonura Building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developer aimed to make the house stand out in the luxury spec market, designing a darkly stained cedar wood home in a market where "everything was white on white on white," says listing agent Jesse Lally of Hilton &amp; Hyland, who helped design the home. He said they spent $2.5 million on teak wood for sliding glass doors and finishes. A concrete board-formed wall, created by pressing cedar wood against wet concrete, cost another "couple million dollars."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home has six bedrooms, seven full bathrooms and three half baths. The guesthouse is connected to the home by an 850-square-foot art gallery filled with pieces by Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst, among others. About 28 artworks on display in the home are available for purchase, but not included in the sales price. The most expensive piece, the Pablo Picasso sketch "Fumeur a la Cigarette Rouge," is asking $110,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everything else in the home, including Italian furnishings and three stocked bars, will be included, Mr. Lally said. Other features include a 210-foot infinity-edge pool and a 22-person home theater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lally shares the listing with Branden Williams, also from Hilton &amp; Hyland.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actor Kelsey Grammer will list his 3,076-square-foot condo in New York's Chelsea for $9.75 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "Frasier" star purchased the property for $6.4 million in 2010 through a limited-liability company, according to public records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three-bedroom, 3 1/2-bath apartment is on an upper floor of a glassy 23-story tower designed by French architect Jean Nouvel. The unit has 11-foot ceilings and roughly 100 linear feet of glass walls overlooking the Hudson River and Manhattan landmarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Grammer's publicist, Stan Rosenfield, said his client is selling the apartment because he and his family "have outgrown it." Mr. Grammer, 61, is starring in the Amazon drama "The Last Tycoon."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emily Beare and Daniel Amell of CORE have the listing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Palm Beach, Fla., home of Daniel Borislow, the late inventor of MagicJack, a device that enabled voice calls over the internet, has been listed for $27.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nearly 1-acre property, with 228 feet on the ocean, boasts a unique feature: a soccer field abutting a white-sand beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Borislow was a soccer enthusiast. In 2011, he purchased the Washington Freedom, a team in the Women's Professional Soccer league. He moved the team to Florida and renamed it MagicJack; he clashed in court with the league, which disbanded in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Borislow died two years ago at age 52, while playing soccer in nearby Jupiter, Fla. His wife, Michelle, who has three other homes, is listing the house with Traci DeGeorge of Waterfront Properties &amp; Club Communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family used the field for sports and entertaining, says Ms. Borislow. She notes that this part of the lot is buildable, should a buyer wish to add to the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house, built in 1970, measures nearly 10,000 square feet, with four bedrooms, six bathrooms and a 2,400-bottle wine cellar. The home features nearly surrounding views of the ocean, with floor-to-ceiling, hurricane-resistant glass windows.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kelvin Kingsley moved last year from Britain to Cyprus, where he bought a four-bedroom, four-bathroom property outside of Paphos for €410,000, or about $450,000. He is spending around $165,000 to add a hot tub, a pneumatic elevator that travels to all four floors, an additional room and other amenities to "just get it how I want it," said Mr. Kingsley, a 52-year-old real-estate investor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In abandoning the U.K. for this island in the Eastern Mediterranean, "the capital-gains tax was key," Mr. Kingsley explained. "That and the sun."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mild winters, ocean breezes and plenty of sunshine are nice, but the real draw for many luxury-home buyers to Cyprus is an array of government incentives, including tax breaks for homeowners, half-price title deeds and even the chance to obtain a <span class="companylink">European Union</span> passport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kingsley, originally from the English city of Norwich, owns around 75 properties in Britain. But last summer, Cyprus passed legislation that allowed anybody who spends more than 183 days a year in the country to become a tax resident. Now, as a Cypriot resident, he will pay no capital-gains taxes in Cyprus on his British assets when they're sold, and will only pay the <span class="companylink">U.K. government</span> tax on gains accrued after April 2015, when the <span class="companylink">British government</span> clamped down on taxation rules for owners of British property living abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, home sales and prices in Cyprus haven't shot up from steep declines after the 2008 financial crisis, but there are signs of stabilization, according to the London-based <span class="companylink">Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors</span>, which tracks global real-estate trends. In the first quarter, house prices in Cyprus were up 1.5% compared with the same period a year earlier; condominium prices were up 1.2%, RICS data show. The average home price on the Greek Cypriot side of the island, where most expats relocate, is about $110,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local home buyers remain inhibited by high unemployment levels and limited access to bank funding, the July RICS report said. But foreign buyers, especially from the U.K. and Russia, have played a big role in the upturn, local property brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Britain's vote to leave the EU has rattled many property markets [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/brexit-vote-roils-real-estate-markets-1467146797], and analysts say the fall in sterling could impact tourism. So far, there hasn't yet been an impact on Cyprus' housing market, said Janine Maratheftis of West Coast Property Sales &amp; Rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the week running up to the referendum, Ms. Maratheftis said three British home buyers put deposits down on homes, but only because they negotiated a clause that allowed them to pull out in the event of a Brexit. After the vote, "all three have decided to go through with the sale anyway," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government initiatives, alongside a more general economic stabilization, have been big drivers of the recovery. Last year, the Cypriot government enacted a temporary program that cut the cost of title-deed transfers in half, an initiative that is set to be made permanent, a spokesman for the republic's ministry of finance said. This means a title transfer on a $1 million home sale now costs about $40,065, compared with the $80,132 it would have cost in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new law passed this summer will cut property taxes by 75% this year and abolish them altogether in 2017, the spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For buyers spending big sums, Cypriot passports—which provide access to the <span class="companylink">EU</span>—are available. Groups of up to five people investing at least €12.5 million, or $13.72 million, on assets like a house, company or government bonds can get passports for about $3.43 million each. Individual buyers need to invest at least $5.5 million, although the group method is most common, the spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Challenges to the housing recovery remain. A surplus of homes is still damping the market, especially in the western side of the island. This leaves room to haggle, local property brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discounts on the western side of the island around Paphos can be had across price ranges, said Dimitris Maratheftis, director at West Coast. For instance, a wealthy Russian buyer recently haggled for a villa listed for $3.3 million down to $1.1 million, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British expats tend to flock to the coast around Paphos and the breezy beach scene. Ancient sites stretching back thousands of years and nature reserves are also a big draw. In this area, about 85 miles from the main airport, luxury prices can start well under $1 million and rise above $6.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the south coast is Limassol, a city where the high-end housing market is dominated by Russians, brokers said. A marina with slips large enough to accommodate superyachts opened last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2013, Svetlana Nekrasova, a 40-year-old Russian, and her Indian husband, Ajit Bubber, finished building a luxury home in Limassol on a hill that overlooks the ruin of an ancient temple and is just a three-minute walk to the beach. The home features an elevator, pool, rooftop hot tub and a lighted outdoor dance floor for tango, a passion of the couple. "It feels like home here," said Ms. Nekrasova, a commodity trader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Down the hill from their home, along the beach, is a five-bedroom contemporary-style mansion that features an aquarium, a moss-lined winter garden, sauna and massage rooms. The home, which has been on the market since 2013, is listed for $33 million, said Andreas Makedonas, chief executive of Country Rose Property Developers. The first floor has space for staff, and the entire fifth floor is the master bedroom. Part of the building is bulletproof, a popular amenity for Russian clients, Mr. Makedonas said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign home buyers buy almost exclusively on the Greek Cypriot side of the island. The island of Cyprus is has been split in two since Turkey invaded in 1974. The southern Greek Cypriot side is home to the government recognized by the international community. The northern Turkish Cypriot side isn't recognized. A <span class="companylink">United Nations peacekeeping</span> force maintains a dusty no-man's-land between the two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While properties in the northern part of the island are generally cheaper, ownership is disputed between Greek Cypriots displaced in 1974 and people currently living on the land. Traveling in the north of Cyprus is safe, but buying properties there "could have serious financial and legal implications," according to the <span class="companylink">U.K. government</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the Greek Cypriot side, Grace Cullen, 67, is selling the home in the hills above Paphos that she and her husband, David, built in 2003. Listed for $3.57 million, the home has three bedrooms with en suite bathrooms. Outdoor entertaining spaces and pool have stunning views of the glistening sea below. The Cullens enjoyed the process of developing the house so much they have decided to sell and start building a new home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple moved to Cyprus in 2007 after living 25 years in Hong Kong, where they owned a stationery business. Ms. Cullen said they picked Cyprus for its good medical services, a robust legal framework, four distinct seasons and a "taxation policy that works."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The past two recessions were ushered in by asset-price collapses. The risk of a repeat is growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After plunging in the aftermath of Britain's vote to leave the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>, U.S. stocks have hit fresh highs. Real estate is quietly doing the same: Home prices are just 2% below the peak hit in 2007, while commercial property values have hit records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is that net wealth in the U.S. now tops 500% of national income. Ominously, net wealth has hit that level only twice before: from 1999 to 2000 during the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> bubble, and 2004 to 2008 during the housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mere fact that asset prices are high doesn't mean they are overvalued, or about to crash. But it is a sign of an economy structurally more vulnerable to sudden shifts of sentiment in the financial markets. Central banks have compounded that vulnerability by pumping up growth with low and even negative interest rates that have kept asset markets inflated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those inflated prices make it more treacherous to return interest rates to normal, the task facing the Fed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assets didn't always matter so much. From 1952 to 1996, wealth fluctuated around 400% of national income, according to Gail Fosler, a New York-based economic consultant. Finance was highly regulated and monetary policy mostly worked by dictating how much banks would lend, at what rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, starting with the bull market ofthe 1990s, wealth took off. As Ms. Fosler describes it, capital came to overshadow income as the driver of spending on goods and services. As asset values and their accompanying debt grew, business and household fortunes became more closely tied to financial markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was apparent in the explosion of technology shares in the 1990s and the housing boom in the 2000s, both of which were accompanied by a proliferation of new financial instruments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the current expansion, Ms. Fosler says, exchange-traded funds, which trade baskets of assets, have become a major vehicle for betting on industry sectors, commodities and bonds, providing yet another channel for movements in those markets to ripple out more broadly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Changes in the capital economy have always had large effects relative to the income economy but today these effects are huge," Ms. Fosler writes in a client report. "With the rise in wealth relative to national income has come striking instability."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A wealth-intensive economy is by definition more at the mercy of asset-price swings. The Fed raised interest rates from 2004 to 2006 to slow the economy and keep inflation under control. It wasn't those higher interest rates that tanked the economy, but the collapse of housing prices and the financial panic that occurred when the opaque loan pools that financed those homes defaulted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest cycle differs from its predecessors in important ways. Tighter regulation has limited the contribution of leveraged financial instruments to asset inflation -- but the contributionof interest rates has grown. The Fed kept them near zero until last December and since then has promised to raise them only gradually. Expectations of even slower tightening after the Brexit vote helped propel stocks to their recent highs. The result: a much more spectacular recovery for assets during this recovery than for the overall economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has consequences for ordinary lives. Wealth inequality has grown even more than income inequality, and it's more arbitrary. If you join a startup at the bottom of the market, your stock options make you a millionaire; if you join at the top, your net worth consists of a paycheck. If you had the cash to buy a home in 2011, you are probably sitting on a hefty capital gain. If instead you were turned down for a mortgage, you may still be living with your parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that asset prices are so high doesn't automatically mean a bubble is building. Low interest rates boost the current value of any income-producing asset. Stocks' historically high price-to-earnings ratios can be justified if rates stay low. Similarly, record low mortgage rates mean that even with home prices back to their levels of 2007, the cost of owning isn't as out of line with renting as it was back then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the arithmetic reality is that when valuations are so high, even justifiably so, it takes only a small shift in the appetite for risk, expectations of profits, or interest rates to trigger a major downdraft. The <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span>'s Office of Financial Research noted this week that stocks have reached today's valuations "only ahead of the three largest equity market declines in the last century."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Fosler has found that in the past, instability emerges when wealth growth slows to below that of income. That has already happened: Despite their recent record, stocks aren't much higher than a year ago. Profits are down, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It doesn't mean a recession is coming; but it's a vulnerability the Fed should keep top of mind.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edged Higher in June</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A measure of homes under contract for sale rose slightly in June, as job growth and low interest rates continued to support the U.S. housing market going into the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>' pending-home-sales index, which tracks contract signings for purchases of previously owned homes, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in June from the prior month, the trade group said Wednesday.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index stood at 111.0 in June, up from May's reading of 110.8. Compared with June 2015, the index has risen 1.0%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Gabrielle Paluch  </div><div>434 words</div><div>27 July 2016</div><div>10:47</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The demand for land is driving up prices—especially for prime lots in affluent neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median list prices for land in the country's top luxury markets were up 8.7% in the first half of the year compared with the same period last year, according to listings website Realtor.com. The South saw the steepest increases, with median asking prices up 13.33% from last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S. overall, the median list price for a lot in a high-end neighborhood was $635,000, according to Realtor.com. Beverly Hills, Calif., Southampton, N.Y., and downtown neighborhoods in Miami, and Chicago saw the greatest jump in median land prices in luxury markets, according to Realtor.com. (<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, which owns The Wall Street Journal, also owns Realtor.com, the listing website of the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving up prices is a shortage of vacant, developed lots in prime areas, according to a survey by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>, a trade group. Released in May, the survey found that 69% of the 333 home builders surveyed said "A" lots—the most desirable parcels because of their location—were in low or very low supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dearth can be traced back to the real-estate collapse that started in 2007, says Robert Dietz, NAHB's chief economist. He says the finite supply of land and a lack of developer financing have contributed to the shortage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The legacy of the Great Recession was that banks weren't lending," Mr. Dietz says. "Even when the mortgage lending came back acquisition, development, and construction loans were tight for years." When funds dried up, builders stopped or slowed the pace of developing land for future construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On the Hawaiian island of Oahu [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/paradise-hawaiian-style-in-oahu-development-1464108780], beachfront properties near the commercial center in Waikiki, as well as land in the Diamond Head neighborhood are the most desirable, says Rodney Kim, vice president of Atlas Construction, a home builder based in Honolulu. "You have to look for bigger lots that can be subdivided," Mr. Kim says. "Unless you go out into rural areas, you can't find vacant lots, but that's where zoning restrictions get more problematic."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto and Vancouver, the country's two hottest markets, saw benchmark home prices jump 16% and 32%, respectively, in June. An earlier version of this article reversed the respective percentage changes for the cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's main housing agency on Wednesday said it has now found "strong evidence" of problematic conditions related to soaring home prices in the country's two hottest markets of Vancouver and Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp</span>. raised its alarm for Vancouver from its earlier finding of "moderate evidence" of problematic conditions, bringing its assessment for the city's housing market in line with its view of Toronto conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In Vancouver, we now have sufficient evidence to raise our overall assessment of problematic conditions in the Vancouver housing market to high," the agency said in its latest quarterly assessment of the country's housing markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the country as a whole, the agency said evidence of problematic conditions, such as overvaluation and the threat of price gains, has increased to moderate from weak. It said overvaluation and overbuilding are still the main issues it sees across the 15 major markets it studies, noting it found overvaluation in nine cities and overbuilding in seven. Those levels are unchanged from its previous quarterly update in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency's red flag over conditions in Vancouver comes just two days after the provincial government in British Columbia unveiled a 15% property transfer tax[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/vancouver-unveils-new-tax-for-foreign-home-buyers-1469478909] for foreign home buyers in its biggest city in a bid to cool prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soaring home prices in some Canadian cities in recent years, spurred on by ultralow interest rates, have had policy makers concerned about the risk of a possible bubble. Toronto and Vancouver, the country's two hottest markets, saw benchmark home prices jump 16% and 32%, respectively, in June—gains that the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> has warned are likely unsustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with low interest rates, Canadian housing officials have said foreign buyers are likely contributing to house-price increases, especially in Vancouver where Chinese buyers have been investing in high-end homes. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said last month that housing affordability in Vancouver has become a "significant crisis," while Finance Minister Bill Morneau has said officials are conducting a so-called deep dive into what could be driving up real-estate prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing agency said weak energy prices continue to affect housing markets in oil-focused provinces such as Alberta and Saskatchewan. In Calgary, Alberta, which has been hard hit by the drop in crude-oil prices, the agency said it continues to see moderate evidence of overvaluation due in part to weaker economic fundamentals.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The long-run increase in the housing capital income in the U.S. is the result of a combination of factors, including low interest rates, low price inflation, and housing constraints in certain urban areas, finds Gianni La Cava of the Bank for International Settlements[http://www.bis.org.proxy.library.brocku.ca/publ/work572.pdf]. The author builds on research by economists Thomas Piketty and Matthew Rognlie, who have previously charted the share of aggregate income going to capital in the U.S., and the fact that most of that income comes from the housing sector. The author writes that the majority of income going to owner-occupiers from housing capital is the result of the long-term decline in interest rates, particularly since the early 1980s, combined with a rising demand for housing that pushed up housing prices and rents relative to nonhousing prices.</p>
