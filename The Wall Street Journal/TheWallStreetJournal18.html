<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Twitter</span>'s headquarters. A high-rise apartment building where visitors sign-in on iPads. A jar of handcrafted applesauce for $14. Skyrocketing real-estate prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly five decades after the Summer of Love transformed San Francisco into the epicenter of the hippie movement, a new generation is redefining this city's culture again. No longer content to live and work in the quiet suburbs of Palo Alto and Menlo Park 30 miles south, thousands of young tech workers are migrating to the city, seeking a more urban, multicultural lifestyle. They are bringing with them a stampede of tech companies and venture capitalists, and inevitably attracting some homegrown resentment for jacking up housing costs and gentrifying once gritty neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, venture capitalist Greg Gretsch, managing director at Sigma West, which has $1.5 billion under management, moved his office from Menlo Park to San Francisco's Jackson Square neighborhood, a historic part of the city dating back to the 1850s that is now attracting the new digerati. He now walks to work from his Pacific Heights home and walks or bikes to visit startups in the South of Market, or Soma, district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Jackson Square is the new Sand Hill Road," says Mr. Gretsch, 47, referring to the road in Menlo Park that has long been at the center of technology funding. "I'm surprised by how infrequently I go down [to Silicon Valley] because I just don't need to."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of living is high among the new tech class. The median sales price for homes in San Francisco jumped 16% in 2013, according to the San Francisco Association of Realtors. "It was a year of shocking prices," says Annie Williams, a real-estate agent with Hill &amp; Co. in San Francisco. She ticks off the names of southern neighborhoods closest to Silicon Valley, such as the Mission and Noe Valley, that have been most affected by the tech boom. "It was shock after shock started by Zuckerberg." In 2012, it was widely reported that <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> founder Mark Zuckerberg paid $9.9 million for a house in the city's Mission District. A Facebook spokesman declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2013, an 11,000-square-foot house in Pacific Heights on San Francisco's Gold Coast—where neighbors include Apple's Jonathan Ive and <span class="companylink">Oracle</span> billionaire Larry Ellison—sold for $35 million. In 2011, the house sold for $29.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone likes the changes wrought by the technocrat class. Protesters attempting to highlight the issue of rising rents in the Mission District recently tried to stop the private buses that take tech workers to their jobs at companies including <span class="companylink">Google</span>, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and Apple. Musician Adam Theis, founder of the long-standing musical collective JazzMafia, hasn't joined the protests but is among those who have been forced to leave the Mission after his rent for a two-bedroom apartment soared to $3,000 a month from $1,400.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Theis, 39, had lived in the Mission since 1997. "I was really lucky to have had that house for 15 years; it allowed us to have a place where we could create," he says, adding that his apartment building was known as a gathering place for artists and musicians. Mr. Theis now lives in Oakland, but still has gigs in the Mission. "It's not that people are trying to clear-cut or drive people out—there's a balance missing of cultural consciousness," he says.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI—High-end property developer <span class="companylink">Sunac China Holdings</span> said it expects its sales to rise 19% this year in a sign of its confidence that demand from Chinese home buyers will remain strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's housing sector has outperformed its slowing economy, with sharp rises in housing sales and prices in major cities driving the gains in real estate. Average housing prices in 100 Chinese cities rose 11.5% in December from the same month a year earlier, according to private data provider <span class="companylink">China Real Estate</span> Index System. Over the same period, housing prices in Beijing and Shanghai rose 28.3% and 15.6% respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm still confident of the business of selling high-end homes, as the buying power of Chinese consumers remains strong," said Sunac Chairman Sun Hongbin at a press briefing Wednesday. He said the company remains focused on building in China's major cities only, where prices have been strongest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company expects sales to top 65 billion yuan (about $10.7 billion) this year, up 19% from 54.7 billion yuan last year. The firm's housing sales in 2013 rose 54% from 2012. In the first half of 2013, the developer earned profit totaling 750 million yuan, up 43% from a year earlier. It didn't offer a full-year figure on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunac, in which <span class="companylink">Bain Capital LLC</span> has a roughly 5% stake, was nicknamed by local media as a "land king" for buying land in major cities last year. In September it purchased a Beijing plot for what analysts estimated was an average cost of 73,100 yuan per square meter, which they said was one of the highest prices recorded in the nation's capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Buying land in Beijing is very competitive. Every Chinese developer wants to build in Beijing," said Mr. Sun, shrugging off concerns that Sunac may have overpaid for the plot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some local governments in major Chinese cities had taken more measures late last year to rein in the housing prices. Beijing's municipal government said in October it will sharply increase the supply of land for the construction of 70,000 private housing units by 2014 that will be 30% lower than neighboring housing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Not every location is suitable for high-end homes, and not every developer can build high-end homes," Mr. Sun said, shrugging off the impact of low cost housing too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts said they expect China's property market to slow down this year, and that pent-up demand for homes was more or less absorbed last year. They also say the property market in China is unbalanced, with the larger cities facing stubbornly strong housing prices while smaller cities known as tier-three and tier-four cities struggle with excessive supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another wrinkle in the high-end housing market would be the expansion of property taxes. Chinese officials have said that they intend to speed up property tax legislation, which would help rein in speculation and tackle the issue of empty homes in the country if owners of multiple homes are taxed on holding property. Property taxes are currently implemented in Shanghai and Chongqing, and analysts widely expect more cities to follow suit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"China's property market prospects differ across the country, and in some places, the differences are very sharp. How the property market pans out in different cities would also depend on how the local authorities handle their local debt situation," said Mr. Sun. China's cabinet last month stepped up regulation of its "shadow-banking" or informal lending system.</p>

</div><div class="author">Kjetil Malkenes Hovland   </div><div>696 words</div><div>6 January 2014</div><div>06:29</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OSLO—Norwegian property prices are set to fall for the first time since 2008 amid an increase in housing supply and as borrowers face stiffer requirements from lenders, according to Norway's real-estate broker association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association Monday forecast a decline of 1% to 3% in prices in 2014 and follows price falls that started taking place at the end of last year. It is the latest in a series of gloomy outlooks for the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christian Vammersvold Dreyer, chief executive of the EEF, Norway's real-estate broker association, said the rise in Norway's property prices over the past few years has been too steep. A strong domestic oil and gas industry has fueled the economy, significantly improving Norwegians' living standards even as other parts of Europe suffer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In recent years, [the housing price] growth has been too strong compared with what we want," Mr. Dreyer said. "Prices are starting to approach a sustainable and reasonable level."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are several factors behind the projected slowdown, including a recent uptick in building activity. In addition, banks now require borrowers to hold more capital to secure loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price growth slowed down to 4.9% on the year in 2013 from 7.7% in 2012, the association said. In December, the prices fell compared with the year-earlier period for the first time since 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Norway's economy has sizzled, unemployment has dropped to among the lowest rates in the world and households have been anxious to spend money. Following a 4% price fall amid the financial crisis in 2008, property prices rebounded to 3% growth in 2009, 8% growth in 2010 and 9% growth in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices have become prohibitively high for the likes of Ulrika Ågren, a 38-year-old single restaurant worker from Sweden who lives in a rented apartment in Oslo with her five-year-old son.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I can't afford to buy in Norway," she said in an interview. "If you're single with a child, you can't borrow three times your salary."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ågren said she pays NOK10,000 ($1,630) a month for a small two-bedroom flat, which is considered cheap by Norwegian standards. She is happy that prices were expected to fall this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The prices are wild," Ms. Ågren said. "At the bank they've told me twice, 'find a man.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those fortunate enough to own real estate have benefited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ian Mikkelborg, 44, said his house in Fredrikstad in southern Norway has doubled in value since he bought it in 2002, but had also added an extra floor. He isn't surprised by the slowdown in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it's a natural consequence," Mr. Mikkelborg said. "There's been an extraordinary growth. But nothing grows into heaven."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Norges Bank</span> , <span class="companylink">Norway's central bank</span> , has forecast a soft landing for the housing market. The EFF also expects the housing market to remain strong in the longer term, due to fundamental factors such as very low unemployment at around 3.5%, high immigration of foreign workers, solid wage growth and slowing construction activity from this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those projections, however, appear to be modest compared with other analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We believe in a bigger drop," <span class="companylink">Nordea</span> Markets senior analyst Katrine Godding Boye said, forecasting a 7% to 8% housing price fall in 2014. "We don't believe in the expected upswing in the forecasts from <span class="companylink">Norges Bank</span> and the EFF."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Nordea</span> Markets expects weaker construction in 2014 amid the slowing housing market, and expects lower growth in oil sector investments, contributing to slower economic growth. "We think there will be rate cuts this summer, Ms. Godding Boye said. "We'll see real weakness in key indicators this spring."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The EFF didn't forecast prices beyond 2014, but Mr. Dreyer acknowledged that slowing growth in Norway's dominant oil sector in the coming years may weigh on property prices. "If the Norwegian economy cools down, the housing market will also feel it," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">A Good Time for Housing Reform; The FHA has missed its 2% minimum capital standard for five years.</span>
</div><div>573 words</div><div>6 January 2014</div><div>15:53</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospects for progress on Capitol Hill this year are few, but one possibility is reform of federal housing policy. With home prices rising and the economy growing, now is a good time to pare back the government support that has too often led to unsustainable housing booms and taxpayer busts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider the Obama Administration's latest report to Congress on the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>. The Department of Housing and Urban Development noted last month that the FHA has a negative $1.3 billion net worth, and that's after a $1.7 billion Treasury capital infusion in September to offset losses. FHA insures more than $1 trillion in loans and has now missed its federally mandated 2% minimum capital standard for five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is hard to do amid a housing recovery, even for the government. FHA wasn't caught up in the subprime hurricane as <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> were in the pre-2007 boom years. Instead, FHA expanded its high-risk book of business right as everyone else was getting out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan euphemistically put it, "the substantial role FHA was forced to play" to keep housing credit flowing during the bust inflicted "considerable stress." Uh huh. Delinquency rates on FHA's 2007, 2008 and 2009 books stand at 26%, 26% and 19%. Taxpayers will now have to pay for those homeowners who were induced in part by FHA subsidies to buy more home than they could afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama Administration's response to FHA's troubles has been to pile higher fees on new borrowers. Along with rising housing prices and the quiet shuttering of FHA's reverse-mortgage business, this has helped FHA's finances improve from awful to merely rotten, but it may not be enough to right the books soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard to know how deep the FHA's red ink goes. The agency's fiscal health is an estimate based on 30-year forecasts of mortgage prepayment rates, unemployment rates, house prices and inflation rates that no private insurer would use. Do you know what unemployment will be in 2044?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the actuaries disagree on the scope of the problem. FHA's go-to firm, <span class="companylink">Integrated Financial Engineering Inc</span>., thinks the agency's single-family home insurance program is worth negative $7.9 billion but could make money by the end of the fiscal year. Summit Consulting and <span class="companylink">Milliman Inc</span>., more conservative outfits, think the right number is negative $10.6 billion and the business will remain in the red next year, adding that forecasts are "subject to significant variability."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the real number, the main goal should be not to repeat the mistake. The underlying problem is that the FHA's woes derive from a policy of public risk and private profit, which is what blew up <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a better world, Congress would slowly work off the FHA's portfolio and get out of the housing subsidy business. Short of that, Texas Republican Jeb Hensarling has a proposal to spin off FHA from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, make it a stand-alone agency, focus its mission on low-income and first-time home buyers, and subject it to the same accounting rules that private lenders have to meet. How about starting there?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Queen Latifah Lists in New Jersey</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Queen Latifah, the musician, actress and talk-show host, has listed her New Jersey home for $2.399 million with <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage</span>, the firm said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over 7,500 square feet, the home has six bedrooms, five bathrooms and three half baths. It sits on roughly 9 acres in Colts Neck, N.J., in Monmouth County, according to the listing agent Robin Jackson. The home also has an exercise room and game room. On the grounds is a five-car garage and a heated, Olympic-size swimming pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Queen Latifah -- the stage name used by Dana Owens -- is originally from New Jersey, and the house was the site of many family gatherings hosted by the Oscar-nominated actress, Ms. Jackson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But since the debut of her daytime talk show, "The Queen Latifah Show," Ms. Owens is spending more of her time in California, Ms. Jackson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many incredible memories have been shared with those closest to me and my family in this home," Ms. Owens said in a statement. "I am confident that the new owners will love the home and the Colts Neck community as much as I do."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Owens bought the home for $1.685 million from a developer in 2001 when it was partially completed, Ms. Jackson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On display on the ground floor of the home is a <span class="companylink">Yamaha</span> piano emblazoned with a New York City skyline. The piano was played by Alicia Keys in the Jay Z music video for "Empire State of Mind." Ms. Owens bought the piano at a charity auction. But "I don't think she's going to sell the piano," Ms. Jackson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two $20 Million-Plus</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House Sales Recorded</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Orange County</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a big year for real estate in California's affluent Orange County. First, a $22.25 million sale set a record for the town of Dana Point. Then a mansion in Laguna Beach sold for $33 million, in what agents say was the county's priciest home sale of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Laguna Beach home is in the private community of Irvine Cove. According to public records, the waterfront home sold in October for $33 million. Rob Giem of HOM Sotheby's International Realty had listed the 7,200-square-foot, five-bedroom, nine-bathroom home a little less than year ago for $41.5 million, and the price was later reduced to $38 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller, Kenneth J. Sullivan, couldn't be reached to comment. The buyer is a New York City-based entity called Iconicviews Co. LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dana Point home, also on the waterfront, is in a gated community called the Strand at Headlands. The house was sold in June after being listed by HOM's John Stanaland for nearly $25 million. According to Mr. Stanaland, the property is the highest priced sale ever recorded in Dana Point, where prices have historically been lower than in Laguna Beach or Newport Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to public records, the home was sold by Geoffrey and Ashley Rosenhain to Jon and Tara Darbyshire. Mr. Rosenhain, the founder of Laguna Beach-based Jado Investments, declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coming This Spring: A New York City Townhouse for Over $20 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once part of New York City's William Gottlieb estate, a brick townhouse on Horatio Street in the West Village will hit the market this spring for more than $20 million, according to the owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gottlieb started buying downtown Manhattan property in the 1950s, and by the time of his death in 1999, he owned more than 100 properties estimated to be worth as much as $1 billion. After his death, a feud among his heirs made headlines, while retail and residential tenants complained that the buildings had fallen into disrepair. A spokesperson for the Gottlieb estate said the family maintained its buildings well, as evidenced by the high prices they have sold for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This Horatio Street property, built in the 1880s, was sold by the estate in 2011. A joint venture of Greystone Property Development and developer Mark Blau bought it in 2012 for about $10 million, said Greystone's Jeffrey Simpson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current owners are converting the 10-unit apartment building into a 7,000-square-foot, five bedroom, single-family mansion with an elevator, seven bathrooms and three half bathrooms, Mr. Simpson said. Greystone is restoring the facade of the townhouse, including rebuilding a stoop that was removed. When completed, the house will also have a roof deck, a wine cellar and a media room. At the back, folding glass walls will lead out to a 1,000-square-foot garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property is being marketed by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>. Mr. Gomes said the property will likely be listed in late February or early March, "when the market wakes up," for a price over $20 million, likely in the "mid to low 20s."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actor Leonardo DiCaprio has sold his beachfront Malibu home for $17.35 million, Curbed.com reported. The property, on Malibu Colony Road, initially hit the market in 2012 asking $23 million. It was listed by Kathryn Bentzen of Arete Estates. The actor purchased the home for $6 million in 2002 and completed a major renovation, Ms. Bentzen said, adding that it rented for the past two summers for $175,000 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singer Sheryl Crow has been trying to sell her Tennessee equestrian estate for more than three years, and the property has received a major price cut, according to Zillow Blog. The Grammy Award-winner first listed Cross Creek Farms, located in College Grove, in 2010 for $7.5 million. Now the 51-acre property has been relisted at $3.85 million with Jay Barron of Harpeth Company. In addition to a six-bedroom house, Mr. Barron said, the property has a 14-stall horse barn -- complete with a Western-style saloon -- as well as an indoor riding arena and a saltwater infinity pool.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Caroline Porter </div><div>948 words</div><div>3 January 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life on Montana's sprawling ranches and open ranges is being trimmed down in the mountain town of Bozeman, where some homeowners are choosing another lifestyle: the ranchette.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One part city home and one part ranch, the ranchette is a compromise for homeowners looking for a taste of the Montana lifestyle with the conveniences of Bozeman's downtown district. Such properties are typically situated within a 10-to-15-minute drive to Main Street, and come with land from 10 to 50 acres, rather than in the thousands. Still, the properties tend to boast mountain views and quick access to sports and outdoor activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not a giant, unmanageable piece of land," said Ben Heller, who purchased 28 acres with a main house and a guesthouse for $1.6 million with his wife, Colby Hall, in 2012. Their second home is surrounded by farm land, mountains and two creeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm not a farmer, nor do I want to be," he added. "But it's enough land to have the feeling of being somewhat secluded in nature."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With one child and another on the way, the 40-year-old Mr. Heller, who works for an investment firm, said he wanted a place for his family to hike and to fish when they escape the heat of Austin, Texas, summers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bozeman, known as a four-season town with a population of about 39,000 and mountains in every direction, also hosts Montana State University, a symphony orchestra and an airport within about a 20-minute drive, with direct flights to New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the local Realtors' association, the number of property sales continue to rise. For the year 2010,19 properties sold ranging in price from $190,000 to about $5 million. From December 2011 to December 2012, the number jumped to 30 sold properties, with prices from $260,000 to $2.1 million. From December 2012 to December 2013, 35 properties have been sold, ranging in price from about $300,000 to $2.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mike Hunt and his wife, Norma, who are based in El Paso, Texas, it took a while to find the right fit. After visiting friends in the region for nearly a decade for fly fishing, Mr. Hunt, an executive in a family-held business, began looking for a second home in southwestern Montana, but found that it didn't accommodate both of their needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My wife said, 'I don't want to live in a resort. I want to live in a normal, regular community.' So that started us looking in this area in September 2012."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hunts purchased their Bozeman home in December 2012. It is located just south of the city -- a 10-minute drive into the downtown. The listing price for the house and accompanying 20 acres was $2.65 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have renovated the property to include an outdoor living space with a fireplace and back patio, and turned a miniature soccer field into a landing pad for Mr. Hunt's helicopter. "Our favorite thing is the location, the setting and views," said 66-year-old Mr. Hunt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Montana landowners are often passionate about preserving the land and its views, said Penelope Pierce, the executive director of the Gallatin Valley Land Trust, which works with landowners to prevent overdevelopment and conserve the region's natural habitat and its agriculture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are seeing a lot of bigger properties getting carved into 20-acre ranchettes," said Ms. Pierce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She points to cluster developments, where homeowners share hundreds of acres and live on smaller plots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everything else is shared open space," she said of the cluster communities. "Those can be good models."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One such development, known as Eagle Rock Reserve, is home to Larry Brutger, who recently purchased a five-bedroom house on about 20 acres with his wife and two sons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Brutger declined to share his closing price, real-estate experts say the homes typically range in price from $1 million to $2.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We went 45, 50 miles outside of town to look at 1,000-acre ranches. We loved them but the thing is, you're 45 minutes from nowhere," said the 51- year-old real-estate developer from St. Cloud, Minn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Eagle Rock is just perfect. It totally fit the bill," he added. "We have deer and elk going through the backyard with 360-degree views of the mountains."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.K. house prices rose to their highest level in more than five years in December, while mortgage activity surged in November, data showed Friday, adding to concerns that a lack of supply is helping fuel rapid price increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jump was again heavily driven by London, where house prices were nearly twice as high as the rest of the country. The divergence has sparked debate at the highest levels of government over whether there is an inflating bubble, and how it could be contained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.K. lender Nationwide said Friday that the average U.K. house price was £175,826 (about $288,000) in December, 8.4% higher than a year earlier, marking the fastest year-on-year rise since June 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In London, average house prices jumped 15% in the fourth quarter to £345,186, from the same period in 2012, according to Nationwide's regional breakdown, which is done quarterly. This was biggest growth in nearly four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, house prices in some parts of London—such as the borough of Hammersmith and Fulham—jumped as much as 25% in the period, suggesting significant distortions in the hot market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand from foreign investors is a big driver of the capital's soaring prices. Real estate in the choicest neighborhoods is viewed as a safe investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In London, stories of fierce demand amid soaring prices are common conversation. When 17 apartments in a new development in the trendy borough of Hackney went on sale in November, several people camped out on the sidewalk on a cold, rainy night and around 100 more were lined up by the time doors opened at 1 p.m, according to Lucy Phipps, sales director at estate agent Bridge. "It was crazy," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While London prices surged, Nationwide said that house prices in the fourth quarter rose across all 13 U.K. regions for a second straight quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This development was key to the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span>'s recent announcement that it would remove mortgages from the Funding for Lending Scheme, a program aimed at encouraging banks to lend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from the central bank on Friday showed that November mortgage approvals totaled 70,758—the highest in five years, which implies the trend will continue in the new year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Affordability is being supported by the ultralow level of interest rates," said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. "However, the risk is that if demand continues to run ahead of supply in the quarters ahead, affordability may become stretched."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs, though, that the construction of new homes is rising, albeit from a low base and still some way off the 250,000 needed each year to keep pace with the country's growing population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data firm Markit on Friday said its construction purchasing managers index remained strong in December at 62.1, just down from November's 62.6, which was more than a six-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Historical comparisons with official data suggest that the PMI Housing Activity Index is signaling a rise of 40,000 in the number of homes being built in the fourth quarter, up sharply from the postcrisis low of just over 28,000 seen at the end of last year," said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HEALTH CARE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Law's Success Tied to Getting</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Healthy People to Sign Up</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key benefits of the Affordable Care Act -- President Barack Obama's signature health overhaul -- will kick in Jan. 1, despite years of legal challenges and a glitch-plagued rollout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beginning New Year's Day, private health plans for individuals and small businesses will cover a broader range of benefits. Insurers will be barred from denying coverage to the sick. New federal subsidies will slash prices for many lower-income customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many thousands also will gain coverage through the expansion of state-run Medicaid programs. States that chose not to expand the programs for low-income people will face pressure from hospitals to reverse course, which could further broaden coverage in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law's ultimate success, however, depends on getting enough people, both sick and healthy, to sign up, a goal stymied by the disastrous October launch of the online marketplaces. Early technical stumbles for HealthCare.gov, the federal enrollment website serving 36 states, left far fewer people registered to get coverage on Jan. 1 than projected. Early enrollment data suggest that insurers will get more older -- and likely costlier -- customers than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">January also will test insurance companies' readiness. Insurers are still fixing flawed enrollment data and collecting payment from people signing up as late as New Year's Eve for coverage meant to start Jan. 1. Open enrollment will continue through March 31.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MANUFACTURING</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry Set to Grow Bolder</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Confidence Improves</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. manufacturers have several trends in their favor: Wages are about flat, while those in China are soaring. U.S. energy costs have fallen. And many U.S. companies want to stop relying so heavily on foreign plants, where quality and delivery times are hard to control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet manufacturers generally have been cautious with investments amid worry over budget gridlock in Washington and a sluggish global economy. But they are likely to grow a bit bolder this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IHS Global Insight, an economic-research firm, expects that 2014 spending on equipment by manufacturing companies in the U.S. will rise about 7% from 2013 to $211 billion. Such spending grew 3.5% in 2013, IHS estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think business people are pretty confident longer term," said Daniel Meckstroth, chief economist at the Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation, a research organization in Arlington, Va. The two-year budget deal recently reached in Congress soothed nerves, and the U.S. economy appears to be gaining strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some major investments are being made, particularly in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the U.S. still relies heavily on products made overseas. The deficit on manufacturing trade totaled $568 billion in the first 10 months of 2013, narrowed only slightly from $574 billion a year earlier, Mr. Meckstroth calculates. U.S. manufacturers also face big challenges, including skill shortages, deteriorating highways and bridges, and higher taxes than most major foreign rivals.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSING</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recovery's Strength Depends</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On First-Time Home Buyers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One group holds substantial influence over whether the housing recovery will continue or stall in 2014: first-time home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the housing recovery has relied on investors and other well-heeled buyers who can pay in cash or qualify for mortgages under the more stringent standards of recent years. That was enough to push home prices to heady gains in 2013. But in recent months, sales volumes have slowed, especially for newly built homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing observers say the market can't return to its typical output until first-time buyers, who historically account for 30% to 40% of home sales, come back in force. First timers -- hampered in recent years by tepid job growth, greater competition, low supplies of homes for sale and tighter credit standards -- now make up about 20% of the new-home and 30% of the existing-home market. Tight lending standards could ease slightly in 2014, but higher prices and rising interest rates are making homes less affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Key to watch in 2014: Will wage and job growth accelerate to boost organic demand and replace waning interest from investors? And will more inventory be added to the market to tamp down runaway price increases?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Kris Hudson</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EDUCATION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Universities Face Squeeze</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Startups, Regulators</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look for pressure on traditional bricks-and-mortar universities to intensify in 2014 as they get squeezed between aggressive Silicon Valley startups offering cheaper, faster paths to credentials, and regulators aiming to stem a growing student debt crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A demographic dip in graduating high-school seniors combined with the tech-driven unbundling of higher education's monopoly on degrees will moderate tuition increases and even prompt the decline of revenue growth for about one in four schools in 2014, according to Moody's Investors Service. With state subsidies for public universities stagnant, less-selective schools will continue to cut costs. The Ivy League and its competitive ilk will remain strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Washington, renewal of the Higher Education Act will spark debate around accreditation. This spring, that fight will be accompanied by a raft of new bills from Democrats aimed at protecting student borrowers and timed to echo President Barack Obama's pledge to address the country's growing wealth gap. Then this summer, the first draft of Mr. Obama's college-rating system will arrive amid protests of the university establishment calling it unfair.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TECHNOLOGY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keep an Eye on Bitcoin,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cloud Services and Video</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three growth areas in digital technology are worth watching in 2014: bitcoin, the cloud and video.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bitcoin price volatility has heightened awareness of the virtual currency among retailers and investors -- and regulators. A few retailers, such as <span class="companylink">Overstock.com Inc</span>., said they plan to begin accepting bitcoin. But legal concerns, as well as apprehension among financial institutions and governments, may keep bitcoin from the mainstream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cloud services are sure to grow, as firms and consumers lean on Web services that allow them to store data -- whether music or financial statements -- on faraway servers. The boom in smartphones and tablets, risky places to keep sensitive information, will accelerate the trend. Companies like Intel and <span class="companylink">Oracle</span> that prospered by selling computer-related products are scrambling to build cloud businesses as older revenue sources shrink. Researchers at IDC say spending on cloud services and related technology will surge by 24% in 2014, topping $100 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Web outlets like Netflix, <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> and Amazon have been loosening networks' grip on Americans' TV habits for a while. But "cord cutting" was held back by people who wanted TV on a TV, not a computer. Increasingly, new devices make it easier for people to watch Web video on TVs. While people relying on Web video still need Internet access -- provided by cable operators -- big TV networks lose revenue as fewer people subscribe to pay-TV.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SURVEILLANCE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fights Over NSA Programs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are Likely to Escalate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Battles in Congress, courts and public opinion over the future of <span class="companylink">National Security Agency</span> surveillance are likely to increase in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Barack Obama has promised a January speech on proposals issued in mid-December by his review panel. A second panel, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, plans two reports in late January and early February -- one on the NSA's phone-data-surveillance program and another on the agency's use of U.S. infrastructure for foreign eavesdropping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Capitol Hill, Congress will debate competing measures. One bill by leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary committees would overhaul the NSA's phone program. Another backed by leaders of the intelligence committees would keep the program intact but add additional transparency and reporting requirements. Mr. Obama's position could tip the scales. The law undergirding the phone program expires in 18 months, which could force action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conflicting court rulings will head toward appeals. A federal judge in Washington ruled in December that the phone program is probably unconstitutional, but a judge in New York determined opposite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, whose leaks instigated the changes, is living under temporary asylum in Russia.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Queen Latifah, the musician, actress and talk-show host, has listed her New Jersey home for $2.399 million with <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage</span>, the firm said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over 7,500 square feet, the home has six bedrooms, five bathrooms and three half baths. It sits on roughly 9 acres in Colts Neck, N.J., in Monmouth County, according to the listing agent Robin Jackson. The home also has an exercise room and game room. On the grounds is a five-car garage and a heated, Olympic-size swimming pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Queen Latifah—the stage name used by Dana Owens—is originally from New Jersey, and the house was the site of many family gatherings hosted by the Oscar-nominated actress, Ms. Jackson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But since the debut of her daytime talk show, "The Queen Latifah Show," Ms. Owens is spending more of her time in California, Ms. Jackson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many incredible memories have been shared with those closest to me and my family in this home," Ms. Owens said in a statement. "I am confident that the new owners will love the home and the Colts Neck community as much as I do."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Owens bought the home for $1.685 million from a developer in 2001 when it was partially completed, Ms. Jackson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On display on the ground floor of the home is a <span class="companylink">Yamaha</span> piano emblazoned with a New York City skyline. The piano was played by Alicia Keys in the Jay Z music video for "Empire State of Mind." Ms. Owens bought the piano at a charity auction. But "I don't think she's going to sell the piano," Ms. Jackson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a big year for real estate in California's affluent Orange County. First, a $22.25 million sale set a record for the town of Dana Point. Then a mansion in Laguna Beach sold for $33 million, in what agents say was the county's priciest home sale of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Laguna Beach home, above, is in the private community of Irvine Cove. According to public records, the waterfront home sold in October for $33 million. Rob Giem of HÔM Sotheby's International Realty had listed the 7,200-square-foot, five-bedroom, nine-bathroom home a little less than year ago for $41.5 million, and the price was later reduced to $38 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller, Kenneth J. Sullivan, couldn't be reached to comment. The buyer is a New York City-based entity called Iconicviews Co. LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dana Point home, also on the waterfront, is in a gated community called the Strand at Headlands. The house, below, was sold in June after being listed by HÔM's John Stanaland for nearly $25 million. According to Mr. Stanaland, the property is the highest priced sale ever recorded in Dana Point, where prices have historically been lower than in Laguna Beach or Newport Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to public records, the home was sold by Geoffrey and Ashley Rosenhain to Jon and Tara Darbyshire. Mr. Rosenhain, the founder of Laguna Beach-based Jado Investments, declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once part of New York City's William Gottlieb estate, a brick townhouse on Horatio Street in the West Village will hit the market this spring for more than $20 million, according to the owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gottlieb started buying downtown Manhattan property in the 1950s, and by the time of his death in 1999, he owned more than 100 properties estimated to be worth as much as $1 billion. After his death, a feud among his heirs made headlines, while retail and residential tenants complained that the buildings had fallen into disrepair. A spokesperson for the Gottlieb estate said the family maintained its buildings well, as evidenced by the high prices they have sold for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This Horatio Street property, built in the 1880s, was sold by the estate in 2011. A joint venture of Greystone Property Development and developer Mark Blau bought it in 2012 for about $10 million, said Greystone's Jeffrey Simpson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current owners are converting the 10-unit apartment building into a 7,000-square-foot, five bedroom, single-family mansion with an elevator, seven bathrooms and three half bathrooms, Mr. Simpson said. Greystone is restoring the facade of the townhouse, including rebuilding a stoop that was removed. When completed, the house will also have a roof deck, a wine cellar and a media room. At the back, folding glass walls will lead out to a 1,000-square-foot garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property is being marketed by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>. Mr. Gomes said the property will likely be listed in late February or early March, "when the market wakes up," for a price over $20 million, likely in the "mid to low 20s."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actor Leonardo DiCaprio has sold his beachfront Malibu home for $17.35 million, Curbed.com reported. The property, on Malibu Colony Road, initially hit the market in 2012 asking $23 million. It was listed by Kathryn Bentzen of Areté Estates. The actor purchased the home for $6 million in 2002 and completed a major renovation, Ms. Bentzen said, adding that it rented for the past two summers for $175,000 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singer Sheryl Crow has been trying to sell her Tennessee equestrian estate for more than three years, and the property has received a major price cut, according to Zillow Blog. The Grammy Award-winner first listed Cross Creek Farms, located in College Grove, in 2010 for $7.5 million. Now the 51-acre property has been relisted at $3.85 million with Jay Barron of Harpeth Company. In addition to a six-bedroom house, Mr. Barron said, the property has a 14-stall horse barn—complete with a Western-style saloon—as well as an indoor riding arena and a saltwater infinity pool</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SINGAPORE—Private-home prices in Singapore fell in the fourth quarter from the third, snapping six straight quarters of growth as government interventions crimped real-estate investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property analysts say the decline—the first in nearly two years—could portend further price falls this year, when large supplies of new homes are expected to reach the market amid a rise in interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The private-residential property price index fell 0.8% in the October-December period to 214.5 points, according to preliminary estimates issued Thursday by the <span class="companylink">Urban Redevelopment Authority</span>. Prices last fell in the first quarter of 2012, before rising by 5% in the 18 months up to September—including a 0.4% increase in the third quarter last year and a 1% rise in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Although another wave of activity is expected in light of more offerings in the pipeline, the various government measures have effectively curtailed demand from all groups of home buyers," said Chia Siew Chuin, director of research and advisory at property consultancy Colliers International. "Would-be buyers will also be concerned about the increase in interest rates."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fourth-quarter price decline marked the private-housing market's worst showing since the second quarter of 2009—the market's most recent cyclical trough—when prices fell 4.7% from the quarter before. Despite the latest drop, private-home prices are up 61% since the end of June 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singapore has repeatedly tried to temper exuberance in its property market in recent years, imposing a series of cooling measures since September 2009 to combat upward price pressures from low interest rates and abundant capital inflows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators imposed curbs most recently in June, tightening property-loan rules to discourage imprudent borrowing ahead of a looming rise in interest rates. These followed January measures that mainly targeted foreign investors and residents who already owned homes—stamp duties and down-payment requirements were raised while borrowing caps were tightened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such interventions helped tame private-housing sales this year. According to URA data, private developers in Singapore sold 14,951 new residences between January and November 2013—nearly 30% fewer than in the year-earlier period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price growth has decelerated as a result, as developers adopt more competitive pricing strategies, analysts say. Private-home prices increased by 1.2% in 2013, after a 2.8% rise in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales may slow further this year thanks to potentially "stronger headwinds in the second half of 2014, given fewer attractive sites are ready for launch," said Christine Li, head of research at property consultancy OrangeTee. She expects private-home prices to fall between 2% to 5% over the next 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fourth-quarter data suggest weaker demand for high-end housing and suburban homes. Prices for residences without land, such as apartments, in the core central region fell 2.2%, following a 0.3% decline in the third quarter. Prices in the rest of the central region rose 0.8%, reversing a 0.9% decline the quarter before..</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside of the central region, where demand had been strongest in the past year, prices declined 0.6%—the first drop since the second quarter of 2009, and following a 2.2% rise in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest URA data also mirror estimates from the Housing and Development Board, which showed prices of resold public housing declining 1.3% in the October-December period from the previous three months, extending a 0.9% slide in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimates are based on transaction prices compiled in the first 10 weeks of the quarter. Final figures will be issued in four weeks.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SYDNEY—Home prices in Australia's main cities surged in 2013, deepening concern a possible housing bubble may be forming that could potentially derail a fragile economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country's property market ran hot again last year with prices nationally rising at the fastest pace in more than three years, fueled by record-low interest rates and growing demand for investment housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp rises throughout past year have created some of the most expensive property in the world, fanning concern the market may be overheating and that a sudden crash could make jittery consumers even more nervous about spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank has cut rates eight times in the past two years to try to get other sectors such as retail and housing to pick up and to compensate for a fading mining boom that is expected to dent the economy in coming years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The RP Data-Rismark house-price report for December showed home values rose by 9.8% during the 2013 calendar year. Sydney, the country's largest property market, posted a 14.5% gain over the same period, while property prices in Melbourne and Perth also made strong advances. In December, home values nationally rose by 1.4% from November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing figures came on the same day data showed manufacturing activity contracted in the last month of 2013. It was the second contraction in a row that erased expansions in September and October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This latest snapshot is yet another reminder of the urgency for Australia to put itself on a more balanced and diversified growth path," said Innes Willox, chief executive of AIG Group, which did the survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disparity between surging house prices and weaker manufacturing highlights the key challenge facing Australia's economic-policy makers, who must find new sources of growth as the decadelong mining boom cools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate to 2.5% in August to help cushion the economy from a mining slowdown that is expected to push unemployment higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resource-rich economy has already weakened after growing for 22 years straight. It expanded by 0.6% in the third quarter from the second, and by 2.3% from a year earlier, much slower than quarterly growth rates of as high as 4% in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Areas such as manufacturing, retail and tourism have been slow to respond to the lure of cheap credit, while investment in the mining sector slowed sharply last year. Consumer spending is showing only tentative signs of recovering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With rates so low, the central bank has resorted to trying to jawbone down the Australian dollar, which has traded near historic highs for much of the past three years but has fallen below parity with the U.S. dollar in recent months. A high Aussie dollar makes life harder for exporters, particularly manufacturers, who lose out when repatriating overseas earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Workman, a senior economist at the <span class="companylink">Commonwealth Bank of Australia</span>, said he expected house prices to continue to rise this year, making further rate cuts less likely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"From a financial stability perspective, house price appreciation is something that the RBA will continue to watch closely in 2014," Mr. Workman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Braddick, head of property research at <span class="companylink">Australia and New Zealand Banking Group</span>, based in Melbourne, said it was too soon to be talking about a house-price bubble, saying fundamental economic factors were driving prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Gains are largely explained by improved affordability, the release of pent-up sales and some catch up following earlier price falls," Mr. Braddick said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications Home prices in Australia's main cities surged in 2013. An earlier version of this story incorrectly said it was in 2014. </p>

</div><div class="author">Esther Fung </div><div>518 words</div><div>31 December 2013</div><div>05:25</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI—China's housing market showed a modest pickup in December from November, new data show, as routine year-end difficulties in securing mortgages and a slower pace of new launches capped price growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the release on Tuesday by data provider China Real Estate Index System showed prices grew 11.5% in December compared with one year ago, in the highest increase since August 2011. The result caps a year of increases that shows the challenge high housing prices presents to Beijing's leaders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey tracks new-home sales in 100 Chinese cities. The average price in December rose 0.7% compared with November, the survey said. That is almost unchanged from 0.68% between November and October, which was the slowest on-month gain this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The average month-on-month growth in housing prices was almost flat compared with November's and fewer cities recorded growth rates of more than 1%," said CREIS. "This shows that housing prices are stabilizing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With expectations that housing supply would increase next year, many consumers chose to remain on the sidelines to wait for new projects," said CREIS, referring to 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While November and December are typically slower periods for home sales, some observers have warned that housing sales in China may cool in 2014 because many first-time home-buyers have now entered the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the survey, fewer cities showed a pickup, with 68 cities registering higher month-on-month prices compared with 69 in November and 75 in October. Prices in the remaining cities fell. Prices in Xiangtan grew the fastest, by 3.49%, followed by Nanjing, where they grew 2.62%. In Beijing, prices rose 0.42%, up from November's 0.18% gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers are trying to avoid the risk of a sharper correction down the line and have implemented cooling measures to restrain home prices that vary in each city. Home prices in major cities, in particular, have risen sharply in 2013, driven partly by strong demand and the lack of new residential projects in downtown areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China will continue its property curbs in 2014 and increase land and housing supplies in cities where property prices are rising, the official <span class="companylink">Xinhua</span> news agency cited Housing Minister Jiang Weixin as saying last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers' focus in 2014 is likely to be on ramping up the supply of cheaper homes in China's major cities, and the expansion of the property tax to more cities, which are more sustainable ways of reining in the housing market, analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese government launched a property-tightening campaign in 2010 to rein in frothy housing prices, but its results so far have been limited. It raised mortgage and down-payment rates for second-home buyers and imposed curbs on multiple home purchases, but they have been arbitrarily enforced by local governments, economists say. Local governments, which get a large chunk of their revenue from land sales, have an interest in keeping land and property prices high, analysts say.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices continued an upward trend in October, but a slower monthly gain indicated growth might not be as strong in 2014, according to a housing report released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home price index covering 10 major U.S. cities increased 13.6% in the year ended in October, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home price report. The 20-city price index also increased 13.6%, close to the 13.7% advance expected by economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both increases are the highest since February 2006, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas continues to lead price gains, with home values up 27.1% year-over-year. Home prices in San Francisco rose 24.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the strong increases in prices, the report is cautious about the future, noting many forecasts expect home prices will post single-digit growth in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Monthly numbers show we are living on borrowed time and the boom is fading," said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both the 10-city and 20-city indexes increased 0.2% in October from September on an unadjusted basis, slower than the 0.7% increase in the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seasonally adjusted gain for both composites was 1.0% in October from September, in line with the gains seen in the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The key economic question facing housing is the Fed's future course to scale back quantitative easing and how this will affect mortgage rates. Other housing data paint a mixed picture suggesting that we may be close to the peak gains in prices," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each one percentage-point increase in mortgage rates makes homes about 10% more expensive for buyers by increasing the monthly mortgage payments. Rates, however, remain near historical lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said its seasonally adjusted index of pending sales of existing homes rose 0.2% in November after several months of declines, but that was less than the 1% increase economists had forecast.</p>

</div><div class="author">Nicole Hong </div><div>672 words</div><div>31 December 2013</div><div>12:39</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar rose against major currencies on Tuesday, capping its biggest annual gain in five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar's value against a basket of widely traded currencies, ended 2013 at 73.828, up 4.8% this year. This marks the index's biggest yearly rise since its 8% gain in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among major currencies, the worst performer against the dollar was the yen, which has declined 21.4% this year as a consequence of the Japanese government's efforts to stimulate the economy. The yen depreciated to Y105.28 per dollar from Y86.74 per dollar at the start of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australia's currency also had a weak year amid slowing Chinese demand and falling prices for Australia's commodities exports. The Australian dollar was at $0.8916, down 14.2% against the U.S. dollar this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also driving the greenback's gains was the expectation that the U.S. economy would heal enough for the Federal Reserve to start winding down its post-crisis stimulus program. The central bank announced on Dec. 18 that it would begin reducing, or "tapering," its stimulus in January. Central bank stimulus tends to weigh on the dollar's value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed is expected to keep gradually cutting down the stimulus program next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We expect dollar strength to continue in the first half of 2014 as the Fed goes through with tapering," said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the dollar did fall against European currencies. The best performer of 2013 among major currencies was the euro, which logged a 4.1% year-to-date gain against the dollar as the euro zone no longer teetered on the brink of crisis. This is the first time that Europe's common currency has led the pack since its inception 14 years ago. The euro closed out the year at $1.3742.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Swiss franc came in second place with a 2.5% gain against the dollar this year, trading at CHF0.8926.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar traded at ¥104.97 on a quiet day, down slightly from a high of ¥105.40 reached overnight. It also slipped against other major currencies as <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> yields fell a from two-year high above 3%, diminishing the allure of the U.S. currency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, U.S. economic data in recent weeks have reassured markets of a 2014 recovery for the world's biggest economy. The latest number of pending home sales, which rose for the first time in six months, point to stability in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro slipped to $1.3792 on Tuesday, from as high as $1.3818 Monday, as banks continue to repatriate funds ahead of the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span>'s asset-quality review, an audit of the financial system. With banks continuing to sell overseas assets and bring back capital, the European currency has maintained gains in recent months, foreign-exchange strategists say, although it is now seen as vulnerable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese yuan, up 2.8% for the year, hit a record on Tuesday at 6.05 against the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most Asian currencies have lost ground against the dollar this year. The Indonesia rupiah is down 21%, the Indian rupee has fallen 12%, the Philippines peso has lost 8% of its value, and the Malaysian ringgit and Thai baht are both down almost 7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strategists say the slight appreciation over the last two weeks in emerging Asian currencies against the U.S. dollar has been driven by low liquidity in holiday-thinned markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The South Korean won ended the year up 0.76%, having weathered the U.S. monetary policy shocks due to the country's strong trade balance. Analysts expect the won to maintain its strength into next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taiwan, South Korea, the Philippines and Thailand foreign exchange markets were closed on Tuesday.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos  </div><div>1250 words</div><div>31 December 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have zipped back into record territory in a handful of American cities, a milestone that comes seven years after the housing bust ravaged the market and the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Values are up more than 13% from their 2007 high in Oklahoma City and by more than 6% in the Denver metro area. Prices are back to all-time highs in 10 of the nation's 50 largest metropolitan areas, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of price data from Zillow, an online real-estate information service. Prices are within 5% of their previous peak in San Jose, Calif.; Nashville, Tenn.; and Dallas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices nationally remain below the highs of the past decade, and many of the cities that have seen the biggest gains largely escaped a boom and bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in some parts of the country that did experience a bust have benefited from low supplies of homes for sale and historically low interest rates that have boosted prices-- and sparked concerns that prices could again be overvalued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures aren't adjusted for inflation, but experts say they underscore the uneven nature of the U.S. housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The main story in a lot of these places is that they didn't have much of a housing recession. It's much easier to be back at peak levels when you didn't have a big boom and bust," said Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in those areas that did experience a downturn, he added, "I'm surprised that we are back to peak levels so quickly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Long of Colorado was surprised, too. At the top of the housing bubble in 2006, Mr. Long paid $667,500 for a five-bedroom home in Lafayette, Colo., which is about 30 kilometers northwest of Denver. Prices then fell 12% through 2011. This summer, he sold the home for $710,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The opportunity came up, so we ran with it," said the 49-year-old Mr. Long, who runs a company that collects and sells market research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10 metro areas enjoying a full-scale rebound are based on figures for the entire region. The Wall Street Journal also analyzed Zillow price data individually in more than 4,400 cities and towns in the country's largest metro areas. Nearly 10% of municipalities have seen prices reach new highs in 2013 when compared with their previous peak, and prices are within 5% of their previous highs in 300 more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These cities are largely exceptions, and prices in many parts of the U.S. are still well below their peak. In some 1,500 cities, values are still at least 25% lower than their previous highs. Nationally, values fell 23.8% between 2007 and 2011 before rebounding 9.9% after hitting bottom in late 2011; they are now 16.3% below the high of the last decade, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Zillow data also reveal the extreme variation-- even within a particular metropolitan area-- of the housing boom, bust and recovery. Prices are up 40% from their prior highs in Palo Alto, Calif., which is just 80 kilometers from San Pablo, a working-class suburb north of Oakland. Values there are still 54% below their peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While 38% of all Bay Area ZIP Codes are back above their prior peaks, prices in another 18% are more than 25% below their previous highs, according to the Zillow data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To find some of the nation's steadiest housing markets, head to the Great Plains and Texas, which have enjoyed strong job and population growth tied to the oil, mineral and gas industries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had no bubble here, so there was really no reason for prices to drop," said Keith Taggart, a real-estate agent in Mustang, Okla., and president of the Oklahoma City Metro Association of Realtors. Nearly 2,000 people relocate to the area every month, creating demand for homes, he said. At the same time, there's plenty of land to develop, so prices don't rise in "any outrageous way," Mr. Taggart said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, Gwen Thompson and her husband sold for $92,000 the three-bedroom home in Mustang that they paid $65,000 for in 1995.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People keep moving here, and that really helped hold value," said Ms. Thompson, a 45-year-old executive assistant at a local bank. She and her husband broke ground last month on a $245,000 home that is being built one town over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly every ZIP Code in Oklahoma City's metro area is at a record high or within 5% of the previous high, according to the Journal analysis. Values in more than 60% of ZIP Codes in five other metro areas-- Tulsa, Okla.; Buffalo, N.Y.; Rochester, N.Y.; Austin and Denver-- have reached new highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Zillow data compared prices in October with the previous decade's peak price, which for most cities was reached between 2005 and 2007. The company uses a proprietary model to estimate values, considering recent sales and appraisals to determine the median value of all homes for a given area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some well-off communities in coastal California, Boston and Washington, D.C., which saw modest price declines during the bust, are rebounding quickly and reaching new highs because of supply shortages and better-than-average job growth. Prices in Palo Alto, for example, have jumped nearly 19% in the year ending in October and stood nearly 40% above their 2007 peak, one of the largest gains in the survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What you're looking at, for the most part, are high-end neighborhoods that never saw the same degree of inflation in the first place," said Christopher Thornberg, a housing economist with Beacon Economics in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists worry that home buyers along the coasts could again be looking at homes as investments rather than as places to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the extent that gains aren't supported by rising rents or incomes, "you start to go, 'Geez, did people get a little too excited?' " said Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist in Leesburg, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unclear how much longer buyers will continue to bid prices higher. Buyers often tell Mia Simon, a real-estate agent with Redfin in Silicon Valley, that they are going to sit out the market. "They say, 'This is crazy. This can't continue,' " she said. "The rest are like, 'Why didn't I buy in 2010 or 2011?' "A separate concern is that low interest rates have distorted prices. Most homeowners who need a mortgage shop for a home based on their monthly payment. The Federal Reserve's policies have kept mortgage rates near all-time lows. While those rates have helped make homes extremely affordable, homes could look much less affordable once mortgage rates rise, especially if prices have zoomed higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What you've got is something other than a sensible market-deciding price. You've got it goosed by the terms of finance, which are extraordinary," said Robert Albertson, chief strategist at Sandler O'Neill + Partners, an investment-banking firm in New York. "Prices shouldn't be up this high, this quickly. It's a big, flapping yellow flag saying we're back in territory that we should not be in."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European stocks snapped a six-session winning streak Monday, edging down after closing at five-year highs Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stoxx Europe 600 Index declined 0.2% to 327.13. Germany's DAX fell 0.4% to 9552.16 after hitting an all-time high Friday. France's CAC 40 slipped 0.05% to 4275.71, and London's FTSE 100 shed 0.3% to 6731.27.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite sizable gains in 2013, many investors remain confident that European equities can sustain their run next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Unlike their global peers, European company profits and stock markets remain well below peak," said Kevin Lilley, European equity manager at <span class="companylink">Old Mutual Global Investors</span>. "With attractive multiples, a recovering economy, a return of international investors and an unlimited <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> backstop in place, Europe would appear to have significant potential for 2014."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares also took a breather in the U.S., with the market on track for its best annual performance since the late 1990s. Indexes were mixed after pending home sales ticked up by 0.2% in November, falling short of economists' expectations for 1%, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 25.88 points, or 0.2%, to 16504.29, a record high. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.33 point, or less than 0.1%, to 1841.07. The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> Composite slipped 2.40 points, or 0.1%, to 4154.20.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors said they were wary of making big moves or changing course at the close of a blockbuster year. "Everyone is holding their breath until the end of the year so they can mark their performance," said Ron Florance, deputy chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank, which manages $170 billion. "It's been such a phenomenal year on the equities side, and the beginning of a painful process for the fixed-income side."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Florance said he is expecting "a more normal environment" in 2014, with stocks in the U.S. gaining 6% to 8%. He said he favors stocks in the industrial sector due to the pickup in manufacturing activity, as well as stocks in the consumer-discretionary and information-technology sectors. He is pulling back on longer-dated bonds as interest rates rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Asia, most markets rose. Tokyo's Nikkei Stock Average climbed 0.7% on its last day of trading for 2013 to end at 16291.31, its highest close in six years. That sealed a 57% gain for the benchmark this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Twitter</span> was down 5.3% in late trade, extending a 13% loss on Friday after an analyst downgraded the microblogging website on concerns that its stock was too expensive. Before the selloff, the stock had surged 76% in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crocs surged 21% after announcing over the weekend that <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> will invest $200 million in the footwear company, giving <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> a 13% ownership stake in Crocs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of the 10-year Treasury note rose 8/32, pushing the yield back below 3% to 2.976%. Over the past few months, buyers have shown up when the 10-year yield approached 3%, limiting the pace of the yield's rise. The yield is a key reference for long-term interest rates for consumers, banks and companies in the U.S. and abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For money managers who don't have to worry about year-end, there's decent value to be had with 10-year yields right around the 3% mark,"" said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at <span class="companylink">Janney Montgomery Scott LLC</span> in Philadelphia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude for February delivery lost $1.03 a barrel, or 1%, to $99.29 on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>. Gold for January delivery fell $11 a troy ounce, or 0.9%, to $1,203.10 on the Comex division of <span class="companylink">Nymex</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Stocks wavered during the next-to-last trading session of 2013, leaving the market on track for its best annual performance since the late 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 25.88 points, or 0.2%, to 16504.29, sending blue chips to a record high for the 51st time this year. The index has climbed in nine of the past 11 sessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.33 point to 1841.07. The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 2.40 points, or 0.1%, to 4154.20.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have been cheering one of the best years for stocks in recent history. The 25.9% gain in the Dow this year positions the index for its best annual performance since 1996. The 29.1% rally in the S&amp;P 500 puts it on track for its biggest gain since 1997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trading activity was light as the year neared an end, and analysts said activity should remain subdued until next week. Investors said they were wary of making big moves or changing course following a blockbuster year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everyone is holding their breath until the end of the year so they can mark their performance," said Ron Florance, deputy chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank, which manages $170 billion.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You do have some optimism in terms of the investment landscape for equities heading into 2014, but there are some macro events early on in the year that people will need to heed," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following this year's rally, Mr. Leone is advising clients to cycle out of "value" stocks that are seen as cheap and into stocks with better growth profiles, like those in the technology sector. "The value play has been largely bid up at this point," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Twitter Inc</span>. sank $3.24, or 5.1%, to $60.51, extending a 13% loss on Friday after an analyst downgraded the microblogging website on concerns that its stock was too expensive.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks were little changed in the next-to-last trading session of 2013, keeping the market on track for its best annual performance since the late 1990s.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—A gauge of coming home sales ticked higher in November after several months of declines, a sign that demand for housing is stabilizing after taking a hit from higher interest rates earlier in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday that its seasonally adjusted index of pending sales of existing homes rose 0.2% in November from the prior month to 101.7. The index of 101.7 is against a benchmark of 100, which is equal to the average level of activity in 2001, the starting point for the index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The November uptick was the first increase since May when the index hit a six-year high, but it was less than the 1% that economists had forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report was the latest signal that the housing rebound is recovering some of the momentum it lost when soaring prices and rising interest rates pushed some buyers out of the market. Pending home sales are a leading indicator of demand as they tally sales at the moment contracts are signed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also adds to the recent stream of data showing a pickup in the economic recovery in the final months of the year. Growth in housing sends positive ripple effects throughout the economy by driving demand for construction materials and bolstering consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market should continue to find its footing," said Gennadiy Goldberg, a strategist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span>. "We expect [it] to continue its path toward gradual recovery in the coming year," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> forecasts total existing-home sales will reach 5.1 million this year, a gain of almost 10% over last year. It expects sales to be at around the same level in 2014 and then rise to 5.3 million in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steady employment gains have helped prospective home buyers absorb the impact of higher mortgage rates, while home builders have ramped up construction activity and helped to ease a shortage of homes available for sale. Data released earlier this month by the Commerce Department showed that new home construction in November surged to its highest level in nearly six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New supplies can help to moderate rapid price gains in the country's hottest housing markets and encourage new purchases. Prices are back to all-time highs in 10 of the nation's 50 largest metropolitan areas, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of price data from Zillow, an online real-estate information service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One potential headwind for the housing sector, rising interest rates, could gain strength in the coming months. Growing confidence in the economy pushed the closely followed yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond above 3% on Friday for the first time in more than two years. The 10-year Treasury yield is a reference point for many loans to U.S. businesses and consumers including mortgage loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, the Federal Reserve announced earlier this month it will begin winding down an $85 billion monthly bond-buying program intended to hold down rates, spur investment and encourage hiring. When Fed officials first signaled they were thinking about doing so this spring, mortgage rates surged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then the gains have moderated, though rates have continued to trend higher. For the week ended Dec. 26, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.48%, compared with 4.47% a week earlier and 3.35% a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Rates on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 3.52%, compared with 3.51% the previous week and 2.65% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each one percentage-point increase in mortgage rates makes homes about 10% more expensive for buyers by increasing the monthly mortgage payments. Rates, however, remain near historical lows, so the prospect of further increases could encourage potential purchasers to make a decision to buy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK—The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged higher to another record close in the next-to-last trading session of 2013, with the market on track for its best annual performance since the late 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow rose 26 points, or 0.2%, to 16504, setting a record for the 51st time this year. The index has climbed in nine of the past 11 sessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P 500 was virtually unchanged at 1841. The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped two points, or 0.1%, to 4154.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have been cheering one of the best years for stocks in recent history. The 25.9% gain in the Dow this year positions the index for its best annual performance since 1996. The 29.1% rally in the S&amp;P 500 puts it on track for its biggest gain since 1997.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany's DAX 30 index lost 0.4%, ending the year with a 25.5% gain. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 gave up 0.3% Monday and France's CAC 40 finished the session little changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors expressed optimism about Europe's prospects for 2014. "Unlike their global peers, European company profits and stock markets remain well below peak.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Asia, most markets rose in the last full day of trading in 2013 for many countries. Tokyo's Nikkei Stock Average climbed 0.7% to its highest close in six years, sealing a 57% gain for the benchmark this year. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 rose 0.6% and was up 15% in the year to date, while China's Shanghai Composite lost 0.2% and was down 7.6% for the year to date.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How much does a tacky purple wall color affect a home's sale price? Not much, according to new research on home staging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While good staging does influence a home buyer's overall impression of a house, staging alone doesn't result in buyers willing to pay more for the house, says Michael Seiler, professor of real estate and finance at the College of William and Mary, who researched how home buyers responded to six house tours that varied in paint color and furniture quality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His findings show that buyers are willing to pay roughly $204,000 in each of the house examples, regardless of the quality of furnishings or paint color. However, the research subjects believed that other buyers would adjust their pricing based on how the house is staged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were able to parse out what you consciously believe and subconsciously believe," Mr. Seiler says. "Beforehand, everyone thinks poor staging is going to be a problem. But when we actually did the experiment, we found it doesn't matter."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Seiler and co-authors Mark Lane of <span class="companylink">Old Dominion University</span> and Vicky Seiler of <span class="companylink">Johns Hopkins University</span> led 820 home-buyers through one of six virtual house tours in March 2012. Using professional-grade rendering software created by an architecture firm in Virginia Beach, Va., each house featured either a "neutral" beige wall color or an "unattractive" purple paint color, and "good" furniture, "ugly" furniture or no furniture. The neutral and attractive options were chosen to appeal to the greatest number of people, Mr. Seiler says. The home buyers then reported what they would be willing to pay, as well as their overall impression of the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Seiler warns: "All we could test is how much the home would sell for. What we don't know is whether a well-staged home will sell faster. It may sell quicker."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study, "The Impact of Staging Conditions on Residential Real Estate Demand," has been accepted by the Journal of Housing Research for publication sometime next year, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may be hard to persuade real-estate professionals of the findings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug Eichman, a real-estate agent with Core in New York City, spent more than $30,000 to stage a Midtown East penthouse co-op listed for $6.995 million. His stager, Cheryl Eisen, president of New York City-based Interior Marketing Group Inc., says staging works when buyers feel emotionally connected to the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The bare-bones reason for staging initially is to show buyers how they can function in a space," Ms. Eisen says. "When you go over the top, you make them have an emotional reaction to the space. If they fall in love with the space, they will be willing to pay for it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Darci Willis, a real-estate agent with Century 21 Scheetz in Carmel, Ind., says that when potential buyers are on the fence, a well-staged home may be a deciding factor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even though people logically know that they can change the paint color, it can be distracting and off-putting. Buyers are thinking emotionally at that point," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ugly Study</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers took 820 home buyers through one of six virtual tours of homes that varied in furnishings and wall color. Respondents then rated their impressions of the house and said what they would be willing to pay for it. The findings:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Respondents said they would pay roughly $204,000 for the home in all six of the examples, regardless of the quality of furnishings or paint color.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Respondents believed other buyers would pay $7,595.75, or 3.7%, less for a house with an unattractive wall color and $8,297.22, or 4%, less for a house with poor furnishings.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Maclay bet on a project to develop his family ranch into a ski resort—and lost. Now the ranch is on the market for $22.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ranch is being sold by Mr. Maclay's lender, MLIC Asset Holdings, part of the insurance company <span class="companylink">MetLife</span>. Located in the Bitterroot Valley outside Missoula, the 2,660-acre property has a working cattle operation, but it is a "kind of a different animal" from most ranches, said listing agent Bill McDavid of Hall and Hall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's got the ski runs—we don't see that every day," he added. Met Life declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The runs are on the western edge of the ranch, where the property meets the Bitterroot mountain range, Mr. McDavid said. There aren't ski lifts, but whoever buys the property could access the trails with a snowcat or snowmobiles, he said. Tim Newhart, a spokesman for Mr. Maclay, said the paths aren't technically ski runs, although they could be used that way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also a roughly 5,000-square-foot, five-bedroom log home, which Mr. Maclay built in 2006, according to Hall and Hall. A barn and other agriculture facilities are on the property, which is leased to a local rancher. Property taxes are estimated at $12,878 annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investing money into his planned Bitterroot Resort, Mr. Maclay in 2005 mortgaged the Montana ranch that had belonged to his family since the late 1800s, according to Mr. Newhart. But after years of widely publicized negotiations with the <span class="companylink">U.S. Forest Service</span>, the project failed to get the necessary permits. And after his lenders began foreclosure proceedings, Mr. Maclay in 2012 lost the ranch, where he'd grown up, Mr. Newhart said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Newhart said the Forest Service decision is being appealed by a local nonprofit group, but "at this point, the destiny of the lower portion of the property is in the hands of Hall and Hall and whoever the next owner is."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas Elliman chairman Howard Lorber, who owns homes in New York City, the Hamptons and Miami, is trading up in Okeechobee, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lorber, who is also chief executive officer of Vector, a company with real estate and tobacco units, said he is listing his 2,400-square-foot, three bedroom, two bathroom cabin in the Pine Creek Sporting Club for $855,000, including furniture, décor and linens. He's currently constructing a 7,000-square-foot home on over 40 acres in the same resort; it is expected to be completed in the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At first you say to yourself, 'I want a lower entry point to see how much I'm going to use it'," said Mr. Lorber. He said he spends about 30 days a year in Okeechobee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lorber bought the newly-built and fully furnished cabin in 2010 for about $800,000. On a small lot, it overlooks a lake and has 1,200 square feet of screened-in porch space. Pine Creek, a private hunting resort community, has a swimming pool, spa and fitness center and offers activities like horseback riding and guided hunts. Annual dues are $22,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lorber's Southampton estate is currently listed for $18.5 million. He said he's downsizing now that his children are grown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Reynolds, Pine Creek's director of sales and marketing, is handling the Okeechobee listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Fifth Avenue penthouse owned by the estate of real-estate developer Harvey Auerbach has sold for its full asking price of $14.95 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 3,572-square-foot, three-bedroom, 4½ bath apartment is on the 23rd floor of a rare prewar condo at the corner of 86th Street, said listing broker Carol Staab of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>. The full-floor unit has protected views of the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir in Central Park, Ms. Staab said, as well as views of the Empire State and Chrysler buildings and the George Washington Bridge. Included in the purchase was a 290-square-foot staff quarters on the building's third floor and two storage units in the basement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The founder and chairman of Gold Coast Bank, Mr. Auerbach in the 1970s founded Long Island-based Brookwood Management Company, which owns and manages residential and commercial real estate properties. He bought the apartment in 2010 for $10.95 million, according to Ms. Staab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Auerbach's children, Steven Auerbach and Nancy Karwick, now run Brookwood. Ms. Staab said after their father's death in 2012, they considered keeping the apartment but ultimately decided not to. According to public records, the family sold Mr. Auerbach's home in Water Mill, NY for $8.75 million in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Staab declined to name the purchaser of the apartment, but said it sold to an international buyer from Asia who paid all-cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singer Daryl Hall, of the pop duo Hall &amp; Oats, has listed a historic house in Kittery Point, Maine for $1.999 million, Curbed.com reported. Mr. Hall restored the home, believed to be the oldest surviving house in the state, after buying it at auction in 2008, according to listing agent Kathleen Thornton of Anne Erwin Sotheby's International Realty. The Pepperrell Road home is now fully modernized with four bedrooms and five bathrooms, she said.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Builders Get Into Jumbos; Pricey new homes are getting easier to finance as builders look for ways to help wealthy borrowers win approval from lenders</span>
</div><div class="author">AnnaMaria Andriotis </div><div>947 words</div><div>26 December 2013</div><div>12:45</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealthy buyers are getting mortgage pitches from an unlikely source: luxury home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before they have even sold a new home to prospective clients, home builders are directing buyers to their financing arms that have been rolling out generous terms on jumbo mortgages over the past year. Perks include longer interest-rate locks, which is the period borrowers can keep the same rate for until they get the loan, and relatively low down-payment requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The push into jumbo lending follows a surge in new-home sales and prices. Nationwide, 402,000 new homes sold during the first 11 months of the year, up 18.2% from the same period a year prior, according to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>. Average prices were up 17.1% in November compared with a year prior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sales in the upper-end of the market represent a sliver of this activity. The most expensive homes—those with a sales price of $750,000 or more, according to the Census—accounted for just 5% of all sales during November, up from 2% in the same month last year. Builders say a lack of new-home financing for expensive homes is partly to blame. While affluent buyers could pay all-cash, many don't want to lock millions of dollars into a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To boost sales, builders are jumping into the jumbo-mortgage market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders say financing referrals are intended to streamline the mortgage application process and to remove obstacles that buyers often encounter. Unlike existing homes, which affluent buyers have few problems getting mortgages for, new properties can be difficult to finance. The problem is often with the home rather than the buyer. Lenders routinely look for red flags, like whether the builder's finances are shaky, or in the case of a new condo, whether too many units remain unsold in that building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, builders' financing arms have approved the property as have the banks that they refer buyers to. Qualifying applicants should have the loan in about half the time (four to six weeks) than what most lenders would require. And because the builder and lender are connected, they can update each other on factors that may impact the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, after the housing boom, regulators alleged in some cases that close ties between builders and loan officers (among other parties) had resulted in buyers paying more for services. Stephen Melman, director of economic services for the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>, says those practices have come to an end and that builders are trying to avoid situations where financing unexpectedly falls through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In today's market, some builders are rolling out loan features similar to those at regular banks. Last month, TBI Mortgage Co., the financing arm of home builder <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>, extended its rate lock offer for jumbos to 270 days, up from 120 days. This month, TBI began permitting lower down payments of 10% to 15% (down from a minimum of 20%) for mortgages of up to $1 million, though those borrowers will have to sign up for private mortgage insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jumbo loans accounted for 19.2% of all TBI's mortgage originations from January through October, up from 11.2% the same period last year, according to the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Wilson, CFO of London Bay Homes, a luxury home builder in Florida, says roughly 30% of its buyers in Naples, where its home prices start at $1 million, sign up for financing. In Sarasota, it is roughly half. The company alerts buyers to four lenders that it says have deep knowledge of the high-end market in those areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> Residences in Lake Tahoe, where condominiums starting at $1.5 million went on sale this year, four of the 11 units that sold so far were financed, says Stuart Cramer, president of Kennedy Wilson Residential Investments Group, a real-estate firm that is a managing partner for this property. Mr. Cramer says the sales team suggests lenders that can provide financing within 30 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With small builders, financing can exist in one-off deals. For instance, RR Builders in New Canaan, Conn., has been trying to unload an 11,000-square-foot six-bedroom mansion since 2009. Managing director Rich Rosano says he began offering a bridge loan for the property, whose price tag is $6.1 million, after potential buyers mentioned they wanted to sell their existing home first so that they wouldn't have two mortgages simultaneously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers should consider shopping around for a mortgage before engaging with a builder. Here are other points to consider:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Higher interest rates: Builders' financing arms—which tend to pull quotes from regular banks and then sell the loans they originate—may not always offer the lowest rates. Separately, lenders' affiliates may be less inclined to give the applicant the lowest rate since they don't have a history with them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Financing sources: Buyers should ask builders' financing arms how many lenders they are pulling quotes from. Some will act like mortgage brokers going to several banks, including small and large lenders, for rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Perks without financing: Buyers should ask builders if they discount their mortgage costs—even if they don't have a financing arm. Roughly 27% of builders say they offer to pay closing costs and 7% say they will pay points—optional fees paid upfront that lower the loan's interest rate, according to an October survey of roughly 500 builders conducted by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>. </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar rose against the yen and the euro in a thinly traded preholiday market Tuesday, boosted by higher-than-expected U.S. economic numbers that showed the recovery continues to gain traction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for U.S. durable goods saw its strongest gain last month since May, while new home sales continued at a brisk pace, rising nearly 17% from a year ago, government data showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the dollar strengthened against its peers on the news, gains were limited, with trading volumes low as most market participants already are on vacation break.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Liquidity and market interest are both close to zero," said Steve Englander, managing director at <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, in a note to investors. "Market reaction in normal times would probably be triple what we have seen."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong data will likely compel market players to buy the dollar when they return to work in early January, giving he dollar a strong start to the year, Mr. Englander said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar recently traded at Y104.30 against the yen, up 0.2%. The euro was down 0.2% against the greenback at $1.3676.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The WSJ Dollar Index, which gauges the dollar against a basket of major currencies, stood at 73.835, from 73.851 early Thursday. </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">U.S. Goods Orders, New-Home Sales Point to Growth; Excluding Transportation, Manufactured-Goods Orders Make Strongest Gain Since May</span>
</div><div class="author">Sarah Portlock </div><div>731 words</div><div>24 December 2013</div><div>07:19</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—A pair of economic reports released Tuesday showed renewed optimism by businesses and prospective homeowners, two of the biggest drivers of U.S. economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for U.S. durable goods—big-ticket items such as cars and aircraft designed to last more than three years—rose by 3.5% last month, reversing a decline in October, the Commerce Department said. Excluding the volatile transportation category, manufactured-goods orders rose 1.2%, the strongest gain since May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Americans continued to purchase new homes at a brisk pace in November, the latest sign the housing market is regaining traction after a rise in mortgage rates. New-home sales hit a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 464,000 last month, down only 2.1% from October's upwardly revised annual rate of 474,000, the Commerce Department said in a separate report. October and November marked the two strongest months of new-home sales since mid-2008, during the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reports point to an economy on stronger footing as the year winds to a close, with businesses picking up investment and new home sales remaining near postrecession peaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a holly, jolly data Christmas for the economy as all signs point to an accelerating economy," said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data led another firm, <span class="companylink">Macroeconomic Advisers</span>, to raise its estimate for fourth-quarter growth. It now forecasts gross domestic product to expand at an annualized rate of 2.6% in the final three months of the year, up three-tenths of a percentage point from an earlier estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall durable goods increase was driven by business investment, particularly in civilian aircraft orders, which rose nearly 22%. But a broader measure of business spending on software and equipment rose at a solid pace in November after falling in recent months. Orders for nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft, increased by 4.5%, its strongest pace since January. That could be a sign businesses stepped up spending after the partial government shutdown in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak business spending has weighed down the U.S. recovery, with many companies pointing to uncertainty from Washington as a reason for hesitation. The two-year budget agreement reached in Congress earlier this month may quell some of those concerns, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The tone of durable goods orders improved substantially in November," said <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> strategist Gennadiy Goldberg. "Stronger orders bode well for both the fourth quarter and 2014 economic growth prospects, suggesting that companies remain keen on increasing investment and expanding capacity as the economy and consumer sentiment improve."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another bright spot was stronger demand for motor vehicles last month. Orders in the category rose 3.3%, the strongest since February. That indicates consumers are once again buying cars after delaying the decision in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the new-home sales report suggests the housing market is picking back up after a rise in mortgage rates dented sales earlier this year. Mortgage rates climbed more than a percentage point starting in the spring after Federal Reserve officials signaled they were considering reining in the central bank's $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program. The higher borrowing costs, coupled with a rise in home prices, likely scared off some prospective buyers. But households may be adjusting to the higher rates, which are still historically low but climbing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because new-home sales are tallied at the signing of a contract rather than at the closing, they can be an early indicator of housing-market trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a year ago, new-home sales were up 16.6% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly pace of new-home sales caused inventory to decline, the Commerce Department said. At November's pace, it would take 4.3 months to sell homes on the market, down from 4.5 months in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, underlying demand in the U.S. remains sluggish compared with past recoveries, with much of the third-quarter growth due to companies restocking inventories. Unemployment remains at an elevated 7% with nearly 11 million unemployed workers. Consumer and business spending, while showing healthy increases lately, are still at sluggish levels. And workers' wages are growing only tepidly, raising concerns about how long consumers will be able to maintain the current level of spending.</p>

</div><div>2927 words</div><div>23 December 2013</div><div>16:26</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crime dropped, high-school graduation rates rose and luxury residential towers re-etched the skyline. Michael Bloomberg leaves a sprawling legacy as he winds down his 12 years as the mayor of New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A billionaire businessman who took office with no experience in government, Mr. Bloomberg won election three times, beginning just weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. He guided the city through its toughest economic times in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In emergencies and their aftermaths, Mr. Bloomberg won accolades—for his handling of a blackout in 2003 and superstorm Sandy that struck the city last year. But he took sharp criticism for the city's slow response to a 2010 post-Christmas snowstorm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bloomberg, a generous philanthropist, unveiled a number of initiatives to fight poverty in New York. Still, on his watch, the number of homeless people in city shelters rose. Sometimes, his policies seem to reach everywhere—or tried to. He banned smoking at bars, restaurants, parks and beaches. He wanted to ban large, sugary drinks, but the courts ruled against him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all Mr. Bloomberg's successes, some of his highest-profile initiatives failed, including his pursuit of the Summer Olympic Games. But the mayor and his aides have said those battles were worth waging, the mark of a leader who didn't back away from difficult challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bloomberg brought a rigorous market sensibility when he gained control of the nation's largest school system in 2002. Parents were urged to shop around and choose the best school for their children. The city put high-school admissions into overdrive, allowing students to apply to up to 12 schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mayor also set about opening new schools—many of which shared buildings—ultimately increasing the number by more than 40%. That included charter schools. The mayor took the position that charters were city schools too, because they taught city residents with public dollars, even though they weren't part of the Bloomberg administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A City Hall philosophy grounded in the principles of competition and choice drove much of the policy-making. There was a relentless reliance on using test-score data to grade teachers, principals and schools. Administration officials pushed for transparency, such as the public release of teacher ratings, when they believed it would spur competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the side effects of Mr. Bloomberg's policies became flashpoints for his critics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The focus on test scores, coupled with an increase in testing from the state, led to backlash from parents, teachers and principals. They said schools were turning into factories that prepped students for tests—and little else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An A through F letter grading system instituted in 2007 for schools was intended as a handy reference to help families cut through the complex data on test scores, graduation rates and coursework and allow students to gravitate toward the better schools. In many cases, that is what happened, but the worst schools were knocked into a downward spiral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Bloomberg sought to reshape the schools, academic results improved, for the most part. Graduation rates are the mayor's clearest success: The graduation rate has hovered around 60% for the past few years, up from 46.5% in 2005. On state tests, city schools have soared compared to schools in the rest of the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A federal test that measures progress in cities, however, showed the city hadn't improved nearly as much as the average of other large cities. Asked to explain, schools officials said the city's test scores were already so much higher than average that it was harder to improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As befits a mayor captivated by measurable data, statistics—some widely lauded and others the subject of fierce debate—define the Bloomberg era when it comes to fighting crime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With homicides this year standing at 329 through Monday, the city is on a pace to record the fewest killings since the 1950s. Crime and the number of shootings have both decreased 31% since Mr. Bloomberg took office and appointed Raymond Kelly to head the <span class="companylink">New York Police Department</span>. The reduction came about even as the <span class="companylink">NYPD</span> lost thousands officers over Mr. Bloomberg's years in office and as the department confronted the heightened threat of terror.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a remarkably strong legacy," said Richard Aborn, president of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City. "They have driven crime to rates no one thought was possible. Every time it went lower people said it can't go down any further but it has, particularly murders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other numbers also will shape Mr. Bloomberg's legacy: the more than 5 million stop-and-frisk reports filled out by police, more than 80% of them involving black and Hispanic men, of whom about 90% weren't charged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics see it as a black mark on the Bloomberg years. "One of the areas in which the administration crashed and burned particularly in the last half of his third term is on the issue of stop and frisk," said Vince Warren, executive director for the <span class="companylink">Center for Constitutional Rights</span>. "What will be remembered about his administration is that it fought tooth and nail to continue a failed police policy with respect to crime reduction that hurt far more New Yorkers than it helped."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, a federal judge ruled the policy, as carried out by the <span class="companylink">NYPD</span>, was racially biased and unconstitutional. The judge also ordered an outside monitor to be installed at the <span class="companylink">NYPD</span>. The city is appealing, but Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio has vowed to drop the appeal once in office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under Mr. Bloomberg, the city has also made a record number of misdemeanor arrests—an annual average of 220,000 between 2002 and 2012—including for possession of small amounts of marijuana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics, such as John Jay College of Criminal Justice sociology professor Andrew Karmen, say these relatively minor charges, many of which were the result of stop and frisk, can have lifelong effects on education and job opportunities for the primarily black and Hispanic men arrested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, Mr. Aborn said, he suspected that "in the long view of history the reduction of crime will be dominate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all the fuss, the number might not sound so big: 39 acres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the total area of New York City's vehicle-choked streets since 2007 that has been converted into pedestrian plazas, public seating, or expanded crosswalks and medians, according to a Nov. 21 report from the city's Department of Transportation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That area, plus 141 acres of bike lanes (350 miles), comprise the alterations made by Mr. Bloomberg and his transportation department to the New York City streetscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Green paint formed the bike lanes, and thermoplastic divider markings blowtorched onto pavement demarcated the protected areas for walkers, bikers and those not driving cars. It was quick and cheap, in terms of the transportation infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And often the alterations were small. For every headline-grabbing pedestrian plaza, such as driving lanes reserved for pedestrian use and recreation at Times Square and Herald Square, the transportation department worked at dozens of lesser known sites. Using its own lexicon, the department installed "neckdowns" and "bulbouts" at intersections to extend pedestrian-only areas, making it easier to cross the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Nov. 21 report, the DOT said it had improved design to enhance safety on 137 "street corridors," and done the same at 113 intersections citywide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City traffic fatalities have fallen 30% since 2001, the department said. And the city, like some in the business community, says the emphasis on creating public spaces has been good business. Retail rents have doubled in Times Square since the creation of the plazas there in 2009, Mr. Bloomberg has said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Challenges—and dissenters—remain. Years after supporters declared victory, a legal battle drags on over the bike lane along tony Prospect Park West in Brooklyn. Some drivers, including taxi drivers, continue to grumble about the loss of driving lanes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nothing happens in New York without vigorous conversation and some degree of contention," said DOT Commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan in the DOT report last month, "but all indicators, from the heavy use of new space and travel options to the number of applications and requests for projects and survey after survey of New Yorkers' views of our policies, shows very high support."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From atop One57, the new 1,004-foot glass tower in Midtown, where two penthouses are in contract for $90 million or more, New York City is a very different place than it was when Mr. Bloomberg took office in 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tall apartment buildings now soar in once-industrial neighborhoods on the West Side. New towers have sprouted along the decayed waterfront in Williamsburg and many other places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It amounted to the biggest building boom in a generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bloomberg years ushered in a new vision for condo living and renewed interest in architecture and design by developers and the public alike. Glass-walled buildings with high ceilings and skyscraper views outsold older co-ops lining Central Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers from around the world rushed in to buy a piece of New York, bidding up prices on apartments and houses. With falling crime rates across the city, neighborhoods in Brooklyn became a destination of choice, for many newcomers to the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a sharp drop following the financial crisis in 2008, New York real estate rebounded more strongly and quickly than the rest of the country, said Pamela Liebman, the president of <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>, a large residential brokerage. "It has been the most fruitful time in history to be in the real-estate business," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City records show building permits for 239,000 homes were issued during the Bloomberg years through the end of October, though some projects were delayed during the downturn. That was more than any comparable period since the city's fiscal crisis in the mid-1970s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the city grew even faster. The labor force rose 9.7%. between 2000 and 2010, census data show. The result: Higher rents and reduced affordability, as New Yorkers—especially lower income people—paid a rising share of their income on rents and utilities. In his first term, Mr. Bloomberg announced a plan to expand affordable housing by harnessing private investment, at a cost that will eventually reach about $8.5 billion. The city now says that 50,111 affordable apartments have been constructed, and 107,119 below-market units were saved to date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Mayor Bloomberg moved mountains," said Vicki Been, who studies housing issues at <span class="companylink">New York University</span>. She said that the challenge for Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio was to improve affordability of housing, when incomes are stalled and rents are high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past dozen years, the city has spent more than $2 billion on renovation and construction for museums, theaters and other venues. The physical footprint of nearly every of New York's major cultural institutions has been transformed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $2 billion includes projects initiated before Mr. Bloomberg took office—notably, the overhaul of the Lincoln Center campus and the <span class="companylink">Brooklyn Academy of Music Cultural District</span>. But arts leaders say Mr. Bloomberg nevertheless deserves credit for those complex projects because his administration coordinated agencies and cut through red tape to make them a reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bloomberg and his chief arts advisers—First Deputy Mayor Patricia Harris and Cultural Affairs Commissioner Kate Levin—saw the arts as a driver for tourism and economic development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration also eased the way for a range of splashy public-art projects, from Christo and Jeanne-Claude's "The Gates" in Central Park and Olafur Eliasson's 90-to-120-foot waterfalls on the East River to a living room built around the statue at Columbus Circle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Mr. Bloomberg has been criticized for allowing school principals to use, at their discretion, funding that under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had been earmarked for arts. The policy is one reason why the city doesn't comply with state guidelines on arts instruction. City officials have said the decision gave principals the power to make the best decisions about resources. The number of arts groups working with city schools increased 31%, to 497, in 2011-12 when compared with the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One major project initiated in the Bloomberg years was the new <span class="companylink">Whitney Museum of American Art</span>, scheduled to open in 2015 at the south end of the elevated High Line park (which also was developed during the Bloomberg years). The city committed $55 million for the Whitney's new $422 million home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another project, Culture Shed, an exhibition and event space planned for the Hudson Yards development on Manhattan's west side, is intended to anchor the north end of a new cultural corridor along the High Line. The city last week committed another $25 million to the project, bringing the total to $75 million. Some arts groups criticized the city for allocating so much money to a new organization rather than using the money to support those that already exist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others praised the Bloomberg administration for thinking big. "Having a bold vision is part of who they are," said Karen Brooks Hopkins, president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spirited, multipronged battle against obesity emerged as one of Mr. Bloomberg's most talked-about themes in public-health policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mayor banned trans-fats in restaurants, mandated calorie counts and unleashed a blitz of public-service campaigns to curb obesity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The initiatives sometimes sent eyes rolling—and sometimes died in the courts—but public-health advocates said they drove impressive gains. Obesity rates for New York City children dipped over the Bloomberg years, and they rose for adults, but overall they remained well below national rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've started to make some progress but we have a long way to go," said Thomas Farley, commissioner of the city's Department of Health. "It's not happening fast; it's a small decline. But it's very exciting."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Top researchers and physicians who study obesity say the policies work, and they credit the mayor with turning the issue into a national priority. "Many of those things have had a profound impact on the life expectancy of New Yorkers," said Dr. Andrew Racine, the senior vice president and chief medical officer at Montefiore Medical Center, whose research focuses on the impact of public policy on health outcomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics suggested that some of the mayor's public-health policies, including a ban on large, sugary drinks that was ruled illegal, stigmatized New Yorkers in poverty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joel Berg, executive director of the <span class="companylink">New York City Coalition</span> Against Hunger, said the mayor should have been as public about fighting hunger as obesity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is plenty of data that says there are underweight kids and stunted kids in this city but you never hear him talk about that," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anti-poverty advocates also say that while the mayor helped increase access to healthier food in poor neighborhoods, some of his policies failed to appreciate the relationship between hunger, poverty and obesity. Researchers say hungry people living in poverty are more likely to turn to food that is high in calories but low in nutrition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Farley said that criticism was unfair, because solving the problem requires a change in national food policy. "We have taken that very seriously," he said. "Have we solved it? No. But there are some very large economic forces that are out of our control."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, Mr. Bloomberg stood shoulder-to-shoulder with John Rhea, chairman of the public-housing authority, and promised to eliminate a backlog of some 420,000 repairs at the agency's buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They aren't expected to meet that goal by the end of the mayor's term, but the number has dwindled to about 115,000 pending repair orders as of last week, according to data provided by the New York State Housing Authority. Officials say only 90,000 is achievable because they receive new calls every day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The backlog was the most tangible symptom of the financial crisis facing the agency. It has an annual budget shortfall of $60 million along with $16 billion of unfunded capital improvements over the next five years to things such as roofs, bricks, elevators and heating systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Bloomberg has been praised for his innovative approaches to problems that had long vexed New York, running the lumbering public-housing demanded more nuts-and-bolts solutions that ultimately seemed to elude his administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the agency also faced challenges beyond the mayor's control. Since 2001, federal funding to the agency has fallen by about $2 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But State Assemblyman Brian Kavanagh and others said the city could have significantly helped the agency by eliminating some $100 million it pays each year for policing, sanitation and payments in lieu of taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think he's failed NYCHA at a critical time in its history," said Victor Bach, a senior housing-policy analyst at the Community Service Society of New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration moved to shore up the agency's finances earlier this year, when it announced a plan to lease eight parcels of land to private developers, generating $30 million to $50 million. After an outcry from tenant groups and politicians that the agency moved too quickly with little consultation, Mr. Rhea said the authority heard those concerns and won't select developers before the end of Mr. Bloomberg's term. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Candace Taylor   </div><div>1244 words</div><div>20 December 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M5</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Waves of international buyers are causing a sea change in Manhattan's luxury property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affluent out-of-towners are starting to spurn glitzy, full-service condo buildings as prices reach upward of $90 million, opting instead to buy older townhouses, which are seen as a better value, real-estate agents say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Lewis, a broker at Halstead Property in Manhattan, says he put a historic Charlton Street townhouse on the market in the spring for $7.25 million and was inundated with inquiries from buyers in Russia, South America and Asia, many of whom planned to use the house as a pied-a-terre. "Usually when I get a call and it's a foreign buyer, I'm pulling out my new development Rolodex," says Mr. Lewis, who later lowered the price to $6.25 million. "The palate of our foreign buyers is changing before our eyes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's townhouses, many of which were built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, have a reputation for being difficult to maintain. In addition to regular upkeep, tasks like show-shoveling and package pickup typically fall to the homeowner. As a result, historic brownstones have largely been shunned by pied-a-terre buyers and other purchasers who don't plan to use them as a primary residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People look at New York and think of modern conveniences," says Robert Dankner, of Prime Manhattan Residential. "But I have seen more of an emerging trend with buyers who don't live here full time embracing the townhouse market." He is representing a client from Switzerland who is in the process of buying a West Village townhouse for around $10.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift has picked up steam in recent months, says Kevin Royer, an agent at Halstead who is working with an Israeli buyer looking to purchase a townhouse in Brooklyn. "Since this summer, maybe since April, people are suddenly going crazy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contributing to the trend is condo boards' increasing scrutiny of buyers' finances. Many boards now ask for extensive income verification from buyers -- even all-cash buyers, says Halstead agent Sarah Parsons. "It's almost like a co-op board," she says. Many of her European buyers, who aren't used to revealing financial information, are now choosing townhouses. "They don't want to disclose what they make," Ms. Parsons says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price per square foot and perceived investment value are the other main motivators, brokers say. "More and more, the tendency is to go toward a full townhouse purchase because they can be anonymous, and they can get all the space for a fraction of the price," says Adie Kriegstein, an agent at Core who recently represented a French family in the purchase of a townhouse on West 77th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price per square foot of a Manhattan townhouse in the third quarter of 2013 was $1,144, compared with $1,379 for condos, according to data by Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers &amp; Consultants. At the high end of the market, the price gap widens. A condo penthouse at 15 Central Park West set a record when it closed last year for $88 million, or more than $13,000 per square foot. The priciest townhouse sale on record in the city, by contrast, is the 21,700-square-foot Harkness Mansion on the Upper East Side, which was bought by private-equity investor J. Christopher Flowers in 2006 for $53 million, or around $2,440 per square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, chief executive of Miller Samuel, points out that comparisons between new construction condos and resale townhouses are somewhat flawed, especially because brownstones don't have the doormen or views usually found in tall towers. Still, buyers have noticed the price disparity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kriegstein's French client, Cecile Caer, says price was the primary factor in her family's decision to opt for a townhouse. Ms. Caer, 43, says she and her husband, an advertising executive, looked at several condos, including one they liked at the Apthorp on the Upper West Side, but decided that a townhouse offered the best value and potential return on investment. They bought a 5,000-square-foot home for $5.2 million, or just over $1,000 per square foot. "We looked at the townhouse and thought: We can do a beautiful job renovating, have all the space we want and still be at about the same price as buying a condo," says Ms. Caer. The trade-off is that the home needs a major renovation, which likely won't be completed until 2015. But she says she feels confident that for "the price you buy versus the price you can eventually sell, the townhouse was the best investment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Caer says she doesn't yet know how much time her family will spend in Manhattan -- they also have homes in France and Canada -- but she plans on hiring a property manager or housekeeper to check on the home while they are away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While condo fees in some New York buildings are thousands of dollars a month, Halstead's Ms. Parsons says hiring a property manager or part-time super can cost $200 to $500 per month. And with a proliferation of property-management firms and new technology such as virtual doormen, taking care of homes from afar is easier than ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was certainly a consideration for Carsten Thoma, a 39-year-old Zurich resident who is looking to buy a multifamily townhouse in Brooklyn. Mr. Thoma, who frequently travels in his role as president of Swiss e-commerce firm Hybris Software, plans to keep one unit for his own use when he's in town, and rent out the others. He won't be in New York "a huge chunk of the year," but that doesn't bother him. "You can easily create a similar experience" to a full-service condo, he says, since there are "concierge services left and right. New York is a super services-oriented city."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Townhouses also come without the monthly common charges that condo owners pay. "We have a lot of international buyers who look at townhouses because they don't want to have to deal with maintenance fees that are very high, and you're not there," says Michelle Bourgeois, an agent at Town Residential. "You can have somebody maintain the townhouse and still come out ahead."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new interest in townhouses has started to affect prices. Jed Garfield, head of Leslie J. Garfield Real Estate, which specializes in Manhattan townhouses, estimates that during the past two years, prices have grown about 20% per year, compared with 3% to 4% a year before the financial crisis. "The last couple of years, it's really jumped," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price of a Manhattan luxury condo was $5.25 million in the third quarter, compared with $4.32 million for townhouses, according to Miller Samuel. But townhouses have shown more appreciation over the past six years, with the median price increasing 12.9%, compared with 11.1% for luxury condos. For luxury townhouses, the median sale price jumped 20.4%, from $15.2 million to $18.3 million, between 2009 and 2013.</p>

</div><div class="author">Dan Molinski </div><div>441 words</div><div>19 December 2013</div><div>06:48</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOGOTA—The Colombian economy grew much faster than expected last quarter as construction spending soared and the agriculture and mining sectors rose at a healthy pace, according to data released by the government Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic expansion in the third quarter was 5.1% compared with the same quarter a year earlier, the government statistics agency DANE said. That is the strongest quarterly growth rate since the first quarter of 2012 and beats the average 4.3% expansion rate economists were expecting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with the second quarter, the economy grew 1.1% in the third quarter, which works out to an annualized rate of 4.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Activity in the construction sector jumped 21% last quarter compared with the third quarter of 2012, while agriculture grew 6.6% and mining and oil rose 6.1%. On the negative side, the manufacturing sector continued to suffer, registering a 1.0% contraction last quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colombian Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas earlier this week predicted the third-quarter growth figure would beat expectations, after he saw some preliminary data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colombia's oil-driven economy experienced a slowdown in late 2012 and early 2013, leading many economists to predict it would continue to slide, following the path of neighboring Brazil. But the deceleration was rather short-lived as the government began investing heavily in infrastructure spending, and a growing middle class that has continued to increase its spending habits amid a falling unemployment rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there are lingering concerns about the health of Colombia's economy. Despite the strong economic data, the country's stock market is 11% lower this year, while the country's currency has fallen about 10% in 2013. Also, this year has seen a wave of popular street marches and violent protests by farmers and other labor groups that say stronger economic growth data isn't trickling down to help the poorer segments of society.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong growth data is likely to dissuade <span class="companylink">Colombia's central bank</span>, whose board members meet Friday for the year's final meeting, from cutting interest rates that are already near an all-time low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank board had left its key rate at 3.25% for eight straight months but decades-low consumer inflation, which is at 1.76% through the past 12 months, led some board members to propose one more rate cut to increase bank borrowing to spur demand. But the data out Thursday suggests more monetary stimulus isn't necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data also revised down second-quarter on-year growth to 3.9% from 4.2%.</p>

</div><div class="author">Ilona Billington  </div><div>735 words</div><div>18 December 2013</div><div>14:01</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.K. house prices are set to rise rapidly in 2014, keeping alive concerns about the threat of a fresh property market bubble that could derail the economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government and regulators have said they don't believe the U.K. is in the early stages of a bubble, and have pledged to take any steps needed should the warning signs grow louder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the government and the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> said that a scheme that was intended to encourage banks to provide mortgage loans would be withdrawn. That move is expected to have little impact on prices, which economists expect to rise much more rapidly than the annual rate of inflation and real incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors</span> Thursday said it expects house prices to rise 8% over 2014 as demand for homes continues to exceed supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group, which estimates house prices grew 5% this year, said that London will likely continue to lead house price growth, although not by as much as it does now, as employment growth and low mortgage rates, together with the government's flagship Help to Buy Scheme, support affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The cost of a house is now picking up right across the country and next year should see more of the same," said Peter Bolton-King, the RICS global residential director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is largely down to the fact that buyer numbers considerably outweigh the amount of homes on the market. While the number of new homes being built is now on the rise, it still won't be anywhere near enough to meet demand and we expect the problem of insufficient housing stock to be the main driver behind price increases over the next 12 months," Mr. Bolton-King said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The RICS forecast is a little higher than the average of 6.3% The Wall Street Journal has calculated by combining 13 economists and house builders' forecasts for house price inflation in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average reflects a number of views, including the likelihood that the U.K. Treasury and <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span>'s recent decision to withdraw the Funding for Lending Scheme from new mortgages could lead to an increase in average mortgage interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program, which offered lenders access to cheaper funding costs if they increased mortgage and business lending, was amended three weeks ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we've seen mortgage rates trough, and can't really expect them to fall much lower now that the FLS has been changed to focus on business lending," said Melanie Bowler, U.K. economist for <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics forecasts house-price inflation of 3.6% in 2014, which is a smaller increase than this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some increase in mortgage rates could have an impact on the wider U.K. housing market, London buyers are often overseas investors who don't require a mortgage. As a result, it is likely that prices in the capital will continue to rise more rapidly than elsewhere and remain the focus of concerns about a possible bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Home Builders Federation</span>, an umbrella group representing the industry in England and Wales, on Wednesday said it had a commitment from 11 builders to offer new homes to U.K. buyers before, or at the same time, as marketing them overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Whilst opposing further intervention in the market that could reduce housing supply, the <span class="companylink">Home Builders Federation</span> recognizes the need to ensure U.K. buyers have adequate opportunity to buy the homes the industry is building," the HBF said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asking prices for London properties rose 10.4% over the course of 2013 and hit a record high of £544,232 ($886,119) in October, according to online estate agency Rightmove. That is almost double the 5.4% increase reported across the whole of the U.K. this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne says fears of a house price bubble are overplayed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Of course we have to be vigilant and we do now have a system for that vigilance but there is not that [bubble] issue today," Mr. Osborne told lawmakers last week.</p>

</div><div class="author">Alex Frangos </div><div>475 words</div><div>18 December 2013</div><div>16:29</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's housing prices keep on keeping on. The same can't be said for the country's property developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Defying a grab bag of government efforts to cool the market, average prices of new homes in 70 cities rose for the 10th consecutive month in November, increasing 9% from the year earlier, according to government data. The gains remain broad based: 66 of 70 cities surveyed showed price rises in month-over-month terms. There were tentative signs of a high-water mark, as the pace of the increases slowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of Chinese developers haven't gone up in lock step. An S&amp;P index of 52 mainland property companies is down 9% year to date, compared with a 5.5% drop in the Shanghai Composite Index. Often ahead of the game, investors sent shares sharply higher in 2012, in anticipation of the recent home-price resurgence. This year, share prices have reflected a foreboding 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have a right to be jittery given that a mass of unsold inventory is building. There are more than 3 million unsold units held by listed property developers, according to Capital Economics, the highest level on record and a million units more than two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are more-fundamental worries afoot. Property has boomed because it is one of the few places to stash savings without being financially disadvantaged by state policy. Beijing's overhaul push could give real estate a run for its money by getting rid of artificially low bank-deposit rates, by giving savers better access to overseas investments, and by boosting the moribund stock market with IPOs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another risk is that Beijing follows through on its promise to wean China's economy from cheap credit just as sales dry up. In the past two mini real-estate downturns in 2008 and 2011, developers were rescued by fresh credit that tided them over until sales rebounded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Federal Reserve begins to taper its bond purchases in the U.S. and Beijing is trying to instill discipline, especially with regard to real-estate-heavy shadow banking and interbank finance, raising money could prove more challenging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most companies' shares have a heap of negativity baked in. Soho China, <span class="companylink">Evergrande Real Estate Group</span> and <span class="companylink">China Vanke</span> trade near the bottom of their historic price-to-book value ranges. That may smell like an opportunity to buy. But with so much pressure on Beijing to temper real-estate mania, property prices will have to fall before a fresh cycle can begin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications Housing transaction volumes in major Chinese cities have risen 11% this year through mid-December, according to Jinsong Du of <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TORONTO—Sales of existing homes in Canada were little changed in November from October, edging down just 0.1%, the country's real-estate trade group said in its monthly report Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year-over-year, home sales last month climbed 5.9%, the <span class="companylink">Canadian Real Estate Association</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales activity across the country last month was 3.4% lower than the peak reached in September, which CREA said is further evidence that late-summer and early fall activity likely got a boost from homebuyers with pre-approved mortgages at lower-than-current rates getting into the market before their pre-approvals expired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CREA said the number of newly listed homes was up 1.8% month-over-month in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average, the non-seasonally adjusted home price in Canada rose 9.8% year-over-year in November, CREA said, to 391,085 Canadian dollars ($369,122).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Multiple Listing Home Price Index, weighted to compensate for fluctuations in the composition of sales, was up 4.1% in November from a year earlier, it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The size of year-over-year average price gains continues to reflect the decline in sales activity last year in some of Canada's larger and more expensive markets which caused the national average price to drop at that time," CREA said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Removing the greater Vancouver and greater Toronto markets, it said the year-over-year increase in national average prices drops to 4.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CREA also provided forecasts for this year and next, noting that annual sales in 2013 will remain near 450,000 units for the sixth year in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, it said sales and prices have been slightly stronger than expected in Western Canada, while sales and pricing in Eastern Canada has generally been softer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Specifically, it expects sales to reach 458,200 units this year, an increase of just under 1% from 2012. For 2014, it expects sales to climb 3.7% to 475,000 units, with British Columbia projected to post the strongest gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are expected to rise 5.2% to an average of C$382,200 this year, and another 2.5% to C$391,100 next year, CREA said. It expects Alberta to lead the rise next year. </p>

</div><div class="author">Paul Vieira </div><div>362 words</div><div>12 December 2013</div><div>08:32</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA--Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said Thursday he expects the risks posed to the Canadian economy by weak inflation and strengthening property values to diminish over the next two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to prepared remarks he was set to deliver in Montreal, Mr. Poloz said the central bank's outlook anticipates a so-called soft landing in the housing sector along with an eventual pickup in exports and business investment. Housing prices have rebounded in recent months after a weak spell as people moved up buying plans in the wake of higher borrowing costs, triggered by an anticipated scaling back in the U.S. Federal Reserve's bond-buying program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This rotation will relieve tension between low demand and household imbalances," Mr. Poloz said. "Nonetheless, the risks around this base case need to be managed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said there is a risk housing prices could continue to climb sharply, and "set the stage for a sharp correction down the road. Such a correction would be a risk to both the Canadian economy and our financial system."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Poloz said data suggest the pace of household borrowing has moderated, and real-estate investment appears to be on a "more sustainable" track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its most recent policy decision, delivered last week, the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> maintained its benchmark lending rate at 1%, and suggested the downside risks to inflation "appear to be greater," while risks posed by household imbalances -- which encompasses a combination of high consumer debt and overstretched property values -- had not materially changed. Mr. Poloz said the central bank's rate policy is an effort to balance these two sets of risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Annual inflation in Canada has remained well below the central bank's target of 2%, with recent data indicating the all-items consumer price index rose a paltry 0.7% in October. Mr. Poloz said it would take "around two years" for inflation to get back to the 2% target, as the Canadian economy slowly returns to full capacity following the global financial crisis in 2008-09. </p>

</div><div class="author">Tess Stynes </div><div>350 words</div><div>12 December 2013</div><div>04:53</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>. swung to a fiscal fourth-quarter profit as the home builder's revenue continued to benefit from increases in deliveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Although our sales slowed from July through September due to the adverse impacts of higher mortgage rates, the sequester and the government shutdown, we are happy to report that our sales improved back to prior year levels in October and exceeded last year's levels in November," Hovnanian Chief Executive Ara K. Hovnanian said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During September, Mr. Hovnanian had said the company's July and August home sales had been damped by its emphasis on raising prices, as well as rising mortgage rates and weakened consumer confidence. At the time, Hovnanian also was one of the first major builders to acknowledge that it was reining in its prices on new homes as the result of a slowdown in orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hovnanian said Thursday the company continues to "believe that household formations, the primary driver of housing demand, will ultimately lead to increased demand for new homes and we continue to believe that our industry is still in the early stages of a housing recovery."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, for the latest period, Hovnanian's net contracts were down 8.9% to 1,315 homes, while the dollar value dropped 4.5% to $490.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the quarter ended Oct. 31, Hovnanian reported a profit of $32.8 million, or 21 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $84.4 million, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier. The year-earlier period included $87 million in debt-extinguishment losses. Revenue increased 22% to $591.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters recently expected per-share earnings of 16 cents and revenue of $583 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjusted home-building gross margin rose to 22.6% from 18.3%. Deliveries rose 3.8% to 1,816 homes. The contract cancellation rate was unchanged at 23%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of quarter's end, Hovnanian's contract backlog was up 12% at 2,392 homes. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Eleanor Warnock </div><div>985 words</div><div>11 December 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Asia</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO -- Some of Japan's pension funds are moving into the country's newly hot real-estate market in search of higher profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moves are small and lag behind more significant investments by foreign pension funds. But they are an important change in the ultraconservative stance of Japanese institutional investors, which control a total of $3.7 trillion, the world's second-largest pool of retirement funds after the U.S., according to consultancy <span class="companylink">Towers Watson &amp; Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japanese pensions have shied away from property and stocked up on domestic bonds since the 1990s, after land prices plummeted in the wake of a financial crisis. Property prices have declined nationwide for 20 of the past 22 years, putting investment portfolios underwater and saddling many companies with bad debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, though, Japan's real estate is on track for its best year since the 2008 financial crisis, as a brighter economic outlook and flow of easy money from the central bank drives cash into shopping centers, warehouses and office buildings. The volume of commercial-real-estate transactions for the first nine months of the year climbed to 2.84 yen trillion ($27.55 billion), 43% higher than all the transactions for 2012, according to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Inc</span>. The return on Japanese property during the year through May hit 4.5%, while the return on Japan's benchmark 10-year government bond now hovers around 0.66%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, 43% of Japanese pension funds now have some real-estate exposure, up from 31% in 2009, according to Japan's Association for Real Estate Securitization. Pension funds now account for 14% of the 10 trillion-plus yen in private-real-estate funds, up from 4.8% in 2006, according to another ARES survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At property-fund manager Diamond Realty Management Inc., Chief Executive Takashi Tsuji said he has seen increasing interest from pensions in a new fund started last year and estimates the percentage of such investors in the fund could rise to one-third from a quarter in the next few years. The total value of the fund's investments is expected to double to 100 billion yen by the end of December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tsuneo Taguchi, who oversees travel firm <span class="companylink">JTB Corp</span>.'s 120 billion yen pension fund, said he decided to put money in property funds for the first time this year because he needed to boost returns. For pensioners, he added, investments in physical properties were relatively "easy to understand.""</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Taguchi doubled the fund's allocation to non-stock and bond assets to 20% from April and put roughly a third of that into private real-estate funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such tentative moves could get bolder if the 120 yen trillion Government Pension Investment Fund -- the world's biggest pool of public-pension assets -- starts investing in real estate, as a government-appointed panel recommended last month. In recent months, GPIF officials have toured a warehouse that is included in the assets of a property fund, with an eye toward future investment, people familiar with GPIF's plans said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GPIF participation in the market "will put the stamp of approval on real-estate investment,"" said Ari Druker, head of corporate finance, north Asia, at real-estate-service provider <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> KK.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While any GPIF shift is still likely a few years away, it is clear Japanese pension funds have to invest in a broader range of assets to lift returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most corporate funds hold the bulk of their assets in bonds -- some 44% -- and have very little in so-called alternative assets, with roughly 1% in real estate, according to Japan's Pension Fund Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., in contrast, pension funds on average invest 5.2% of their portfolios in real estate, according to London-based researcher Preqin. Japanese pension funds are still "batting below their weight," in real estate, said Mr. Druker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ultraconservative investment strategy has led Japanese public and private pension funds to earn less than their peers in other countries for six out of the 10 years ended in 2012, the most recent year available, according to the <span class="companylink">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</span>. The situation is worsening due to mounting payouts as the population ages and bond yields approach all-time lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign pension funds have been quick to jump on this year's Japanese real-estate rebound. In February, Canada's biggest pension-fund manager, the <span class="companylink">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span>, said it would commit an additional $316 million to a $500 million joint venture it started in 2011 with Singapore-listed Global Logistic Properties Ltd. In May, the Canadian pension board closed a more than $400 million co-investment deal for office buildings in Tokyo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">APG, the Netherlands's largest pension manager, with 337 euros billion ($462.23 billion) in assets under management, led a small group of investors to close a 40.8 billion yen deal for Japanese distribution centers -- huge warehouses that also operate as shipment hubs -- in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, many Japanese pension-fund managers are like auto-parts maker <span class="companylink">Denso Corp</span>., which won't touch real estate for its 400 billion yen fund. Investment group manager Kengo Torii said that even though <span class="companylink">Denso</span>'s fund likely will expand its 5% allocation to non-stock, non-bond holdings like private equity when it reshuffles its portfolio in 2016, "real estate would be difficult" because of the potential impact of a large loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ichiro Tajima, who manages drug maker <span class="companylink">Astellas Pharma Inc</span>.'s 97 billion yen pension, which has 2% of its assets in real-estate funds, said that many Japanese pensions also are hampered by lack of experience in the sector, compared with global peers. "Funds don't have the know-how to directly buy properties," he said. "But overseas funds are buying lots."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson  </div><div>674 words</div><div>11 December 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C11</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luxury home builder <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. caters to affluent customers who typically aren't deterred by price increases. But even the wealthy have their limits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll, whose financial results are closely watched by housing observers as a gauge of the high-end market, on Tuesday reported a 10% decline in sales contracts in recent weeks, which analysts and even the company partly attributed to sticker-shock on the part of consumers. Over the past year, Toll has pushed up its average selling price 21% to $703,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Toll's buyers have more discretionary income, but even they have decided that the pricing pace has been too aggressive," said Vicki Bryan, a senior analyst with credit-rating service Gimme Credit LLC. "This sets the tone for the next two quarters in terms of pricing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That piece of negative news overshadowed the company's otherwise strong earnings report. The company reported a 65% increase in revenue for its fiscal fourth quarter that ended Oct. 31 compared with a year ago, bringing revenue for the period to $1 billion. The gain was due mainly to price increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Toll's City Living division of urban condominiums and townhomes in Philadelphia, New York, New Jersey and Bethesda, Md., is becoming a larger part of its business, accounting for 6.4% of its revenue in 2013 and a projected 7% in 2014. Profit margins in that division are generally among Toll's highest, exceeding 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, investors and analysts looked past Toll's earnings report and focused instead on the current sales slowdown. On a conference call with investors, Toll executives noted that since Nov. 1, sales are off more than 10% from the year-ago pace, effectively canceling out Toll's 6% gain from the previous quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the price increases, Toll blamed the slowdown on uncertainty about the federal budget and a one-percentage-point rise in interest rates from May to September. Even though November and December typically are slow sales months, the size of the recent declines caught some investors by surprise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trading of Toll's stock started strong on Tuesday morning as investors reviewed its performance from the previous quarter, rising by 3.3% to $34.69. It then faltered as investors learned of its recent sales slowdown, closing at $33.34, down 24 cents, or 0.7%, in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Toll executives are optimistic. "We will, I'm quite confident, stay flat [in sales contracts] through the New Year, because there's just not a lot of action," Toll Chief Executive Douglas Yearley said on the call. "We still feel like pent-up demand is improving, demographics are on our side, affordability is in place, and we're cautiously optimistic about the spring season."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll on Tuesday set its forecast for 2014 home deliveries to a range of 5,100 to 6,100 at an average selling price of $670,000 to $720,000. It delivered 4,184 homes in fiscal 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company reported net income for the fourth quarter of $94.9 million, down 77% from its year-ago income, which was much larger due to a bookkeeping adjustment related to the reversal of a tax allowance made at that time. The tax allowance resulted from Toll writing down the value of its land holdings from 2007 to 2009, which earned it a tax credit to be applied against future earnings. Once it was able to use the tax credit, Toll in late 2012 recorded a $394.7 million gain to reflect the future value of those tax savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factoring out taxes and related adjustments, Toll's pretax income amounted to $150.2 million in its fourth quarter, up from $60.7 million a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the full fiscal year, Toll posted net income of $170.6 million, compared with fiscal 2012 income of $487.1 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The previous owner of the property, a company controlled by investor Sergio Socolsky, borrowed $58.5 million against the property in 2006, but defaulted on the loan three years later, according to loan documents. The property went to special servicer CW Capital Asset Management, which sold it to Related.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new project, to be dubbed One Brickell, would sit on the opposite side of Brickell Avenue from Mr. Perez's highest-profile project from the housing boom: the Icon Brickell, another three-tower complex. In 2010, Mr. Perez handed over two of the Icon's three towers to his lender in a friendly foreclosure after the Miami real-estate market crashed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arizona is back in the business of selling state land to be developed for single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Arizona State Land Department</span> last week sold a 106-acre parcel in Phoenix at auction to home builder <span class="companylink">Taylor Morrison Home Corp</span>. for $28.1 million. In October, the state sold 193 acres in Mesa to California investor Jerry Ivy and builder Del Pueblo Communities LLC for $30.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two sales were the first by the state to home builders since 2007, before the real-estate and financial crises crushed Arizona's land and home markets. The state's land department, which controls 9.2 million acres of land, looks to sell parcels for the best use and price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we've seen of late in terms of the appraised land values and the interest from home builders is, effectively, prices from 2007 and 2006," Arizona Land Commissioner Vanessa Hickman said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Grand Canyon state currently has nine applications from developers to bring to auction state land totaling nearly 1,500 acres, she said. Most of those parcels likely will be auctioned within nine months. But that is still far less than the 2,319 acres that Arizona auctioned in 2007 for residential development, collecting a cumulative $351.9 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Moor + South took control of Pier 39 in San Francisco about 30 years ago, the company was looking at holding it for a long time. Its long-term lease for the tourist magnet from the <span class="companylink">San Francisco Port Commission</span> stretched out about six decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But time is ticking by. Just recently, Moor + South had to keep an eye on the end of the lease when it refinanced Pier 39.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hub of shopping and restaurants recently received a $148 million mortgage from <span class="companylink">American International Group Inc</span>. But unlike the vast majority of commercial property loans, which typically need to be refinanced every five to 10 years, the loan is self-amortizing and is set to run down to zero in 19 years, says David Sonnenblick, of loan-advisory firm <span class="companylink">Sonnenblick-Eichner Co</span>. who represented Moor + South on the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The operator wanted to be free of debt in advance of the lease expiration. "We have 30 years remaining on the term, so they didn't want to get a 10-year loan," Mr. Sonnenblick says.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. posted stronger adjusted income in its fiscal fourth quarter, as the home builder reported an increase in home deliveries and revenue improved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>, which focuses largely on higher-end customers in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, has benefited as low interest rates have made home buying more affordable than renting in several markets. Consumers, increasingly confident because of stabilizing home values, are also trading up into the larger homes for which Toll is known.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates, still generally low, have fluctuated recently amid uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will scale back its bond buying, although Toll's more-affluent customers are generally considered more resilient if rates rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief Executive Douglas C. Yearley Jr. said Tuesday that the company, buoyed by low interest rates and pent-up demand, raised prices as the housing market continued to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In our fourth quarter, the impact of those price increases, combined with uncertainty from the political discord in Washington and a sudden rise in interest rates, contributed to a leveling of demand," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the quarter ended Oct. 31, Toll reported income of $94.9 million, or 54 cents a share, down from $411.4 million, or $2.35 a share, in the year-earlier period. The latest quarter included a deferred tax asset valuation allowance reversal of $4.6 million, compared with a similar reversal of $394.7 million a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pretax income was $150.2 million, compared with $60.7 million a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected per-share earnings of 43 cents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company last month said revenue grew 65% to $1.04 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> delivered 1,485 units, a 36% increase from a year earlier. The average price of homes delivered was $703,000, versus $582,000 in the prior-year period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cancellation rate was 5.5%, up from 4.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net signed contracts rose 6% to 1,163 units, and were up 23% in dollar value to $839 million.</p>

</div><div class="author">Nick Timiraos </div><div>584 words</div><div>6 December 2013</div><div>12:17</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> will drop the maximum size of home-mortgage loans that it will guarantee beginning next month in nearly 650 counties, the agency said Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The maximum for single-family homes in certain "high-cost" housing markets including Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York will fall to $625,500, from the current level of $729,750.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FHA doesn't make mortgages but instead insures lenders against defaults on loans that meet its standards. It allows borrowers to make down payments of just 3.5% and has played an outsized role backstopping mortgages in the aftermath of the housing bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress temporarily increased the FHA's maximum loan limits in 2008 as the downturn worsened. Before the increase, the FHA couldn't guarantee loans that exceeded $367,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress extended the more generous loan limits repeatedly, most recently in 2011. Those higher limits were set to expire at the end of this year. The most recent extension has allowed the FHA to guarantee loans in many parts of the country that were larger than those eligible for backing by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FHA's loan limits vary by county and are calculated using certain formulas that are pegged to local median home values. Loan limits are as low as $271,050 in the nation's least expensive housing markets and as high as $625,500 in the most expensive ones. The FHA hadn't yet issued more details on where loan limits would fall for individual counties that are in between those boundaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previously, the FHA could back mortgages up to 125% of the median home price for a given county. Beginning next year, the FHA will only back loans up to 115% of the area median price. That will take the loan limit for San Bernardino, Calif., for example, to $355,350 next year from $500,000 on a single-family home. Limits in Chicago will fall to $365,700 from $410,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FHA has experienced heavy losses as a result of loans it guaranteed as the housing downturn deepened, and earlier this year it received a $1.7 billion infusion from the <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span>, the first in the agency's 79-year history. Officials have repeatedly boosted insurance fees charged to borrowers in a bid to replenish reserves. Fee increases have made private-mortgage insurance options more competitive, and the FHA has witnessed volumes decline this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials said Friday that the loan limit declines, which had been largely anticipated, would help the agency reduce its role in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As the housing market continues its recovery, it is important for FHA to evaluate the role we need to play," said FHA Commissioner Carol Galante. "Implementing lower loan limits is an important and appropriate step as private capital returns to portions of the market and enables FHA to concentrate on those borrowers that are still underserved."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FHA limits are separate from those used by Fannie and Freddie, which have a national loan limit of $417,000 but will buy loans as large as $625,500 in more expensive housing markets. The regulator of the two mortgage-finance giants had said earlier this year that it might drop both the national limit and the high-cost limit, but said last week that it wouldn't proceed with those declines for now.</p>

</div><div class="author">Eamon Quinn </div><div>433 words</div><div>6 December 2013</div><div>02:50</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DUBLIN—Ireland's economy is showing signs of recovery but remains vulnerable to high levels of household and business debt, the central bank said Friday, in a report designed to identify the potential risks the country faces as it prepares to exit its international bailout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Official data have shown that a strong increase in employment suggests that Ireland's so-far slow pace of economic recovery was on course to pick up next year, the central bank said. Other bright signs include a rise in Dublin house prices, an increase in commercial property transactions, and the fall in Irish government bond yields to their lowest levels since before the start of the country's property and banking crisis more than five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank warns, however, that the country's loss-making banks remain vulnerable to high levels of debt held by both households and businesses, a legacy of the collapse of the property market that brought Ireland close to national bankruptcy and eventually forced it to embrace a bailout with the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> and <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> three years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As Ireland exits the official assistance program, the macro financial environment remains challenging," the central bank said in its latest Macro-Financial Review.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the report, "the level of distress among small and medium enterprise borrowers is particularly acute", meaning that the banks continue to face considerable risks that their business loans will turn sour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks appear to have increased their levels of provisions, but "uncertainties remain about whether banks are sufficiently provisioned to cope with the outstanding stock of distressed loans," it said in the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three of Ireland's largest banks—<span class="companylink">Bank of Ireland</span> PLC, <span class="companylink">Allied Irish Banks PLC</span> and <span class="companylink">Permanent TSB</span>—said Monday they wouldn't need more capital following so-called Balance Sheet Assessments by the central bank. <span class="companylink">Bank of Ireland</span> said, however, it may need to increase its level of provisions across its loans books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank now publishes regular such reviews to consider the risks facing the economy. Ireland's regulators want to avoid the mistakes of the past when they failed to identify missteps by its banks that brought the country close to bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government has announced Dec. 15 as the formal date when it exits its three-year bailout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report didn't provide new growth forecasts, but, following two years of effective economic stagnation, the bank reiterates government forecasts that the economy will grow by about 2% next year. </p>

</div><div class="author">Ilona Billington  </div><div>421 words</div><div>5 December 2013</div><div>07:08</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne on Thursday said that nonresidents who own homes in the U.K. will from April 2015 be taxed on any profits made when they sell the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property market analysts said that may dissuade some nonresident investors from buying homes in London, a development that could help ease the rapid rise in prices over recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the move came amid concerns that a heating up of the housing market in London could ultimately turn sour, hurting banks and borrowers, the government said its principal concern was fairness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With this tax change, treatment of nonresidents' home ownership will become more similar to that of residents who buy a second property for investment purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government said it would open consultations on the details of the new tax. Many tax experts expect that the charge will only apply to gains made after April 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under current rules, owners of residential property who don't live in the U.K. are exempt from the capital gains tax—currently set at a top rate of 28%—which U.K. residents must pay when they sell a second property. This makes U.K. property a popular choice for overseas investors looking for a safe place for their cash, and in part explains the soaring price of London homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today's raid on the pockets of overseas private landlords will align this area of the U.K.'s tax system with many other jurisdictions, including the U.S. and many of our European neighbors," said John Cooney, head of private client tax services for Ernst and Young.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Cooney said it would be important for the government to communicate to foreign investors that the rule change simply subjects them to the same treatment as U.K. residents, and isn't discriminatory. "It will be important for the U.K.'s competitiveness that…overseas investors realize that this is a targeted measure and not the first stage of a cash grab by [Her Majesty's] Treasury," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to online estate agency Rightmove, the average asking price for a London home advertised on its website in November was £517,276 ($847,453), down slightly from the high of £544,232 in October, but still almost 7% higher than November 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.K. average asking price in November was £246,237, according to Rightmove.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks slid Wednesday as investors weighed the outlook for the Federal Reserve to start paring stimulus efforts this month after a raft of economic reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 31 points, or 0.2%, to 15884 in midday trading. The S&amp;P 500-stock index declined three points, or 0.2%, to 1792. The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped three points, or 0.1%, to 4034.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks found little clear direction in the first hours of trading amid a line-up of mixed economic data. Benchmarks opened broadly lower after a better-than-expected report on the labor market stoked fears of a Fed retreat from stimulus policies. They pushed into positive territory after a report on service-sector activity missed forecasts, then turned negative again around noon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's one of these periods where you never know whether good news is going to be good or bad for stocks, because of this overhang of central-bank involvement," said Colleen Supran, principal with <span class="companylink">Bingham, Osborn &amp; Scarborough LLC</span>, which manages $2.7 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks have slipped in recent days as a slate of better-than-expected economic data reports have been released, which supported expectations that the Fed could start trimming its easy-money policies, a process known as "tapering," as soon as this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Investors have gotten used to the idea that at some point the Fed will need to start getting out of the way," said Ms. Supran. "But that is not going to be a straight and smooth road. We're certainly going to have volatility in stock prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the S&amp;P 500 enters the last month of the year with a 26% gain, investors say they are pausing to determine their outlook for 2014. Many say it has gotten more difficult to take a strong stance on investment ideas after the steep rise in U.S. and European markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's tough," said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist at <span class="companylink">RidgeWorth Investments</span>, which manages $49 billion in Atlanta. "There are lots of crosscurrents for investors and portfolio managers into the end of the year. Ultimately, we're looking for signs that the economy is maintaining momentum."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's data had a mixed record against economists' forecasts, but generally indicated continued growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're consistent with the general trend that we've seen of moderate growth," said Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Activity in the U.S. services sector expanded at a slower pace in November. The Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing purchasing managers index fell by more than expected for that month to 53.9 from October's 55.4. It was forecast to slip to 55. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales surged in October, rising to an annual rate of 444,000, on expectations of a rise to 426,000. A report from <span class="companylink">Automatic Data Processing</span> and <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics said that 215,000 private-sector jobs were added last month, up from 130,000 in October, and above expectations of 178,000. The ADP report is seen as a preview of the <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span>'s November employment report, due Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">J.C. Penney</span> declined 3.6% despite a report from the retailer showing same-store sales for November rose 10.1% above year-earlier levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">OmniVision Technologies</span> fell 6.3% after the mobile camera-sensor maker posted better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue, but provided a downbeat outlook for the current quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European Stocks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets trimmed early sharp losses, with the Stoxx Europe 600 index shedding 0.6% to 317.24, marking a fourth straight day of losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of Sage Group rallied 7.3% after the software firm raised its dividend by 6% and said it is on track to meet its organic revenue-growth target in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks posted losses after <span class="companylink">European Union</span> regulators fined a group of six financial institutions a record-breaking penalty of $2.32 billion for interest-rate fixing. Among fined banks, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> lost 1% and <span class="companylink">Societe Generale</span> fell 1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Standard Chartered</span> slid 6.5% in London after the bank said difficult market conditions were expected the rest of the year and that income for 2013 would be broadly flat on 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Tesco</span> fell 0.5% in London after the supermarkets chain said it is performing in line with market expectations, but that same-store sales declined in the U.K. in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail sales in the euro zone declined 0.2% in October, missing expectations of a 0.2% rise. Markit's composite purchasing managers' index fell to 51.7 in November from October's 51.9.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael Calia </div><div>335 words</div><div>4 December 2013</div><div>10:25</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> on Wednesday said <span class="companylink">Fifth Third Bancorp</span> and its former finance chief have settled charges of improper accounting of commercial real-estate loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifth Third agreed to pay $6.5 million, while former Chief Financial Officer Daniel Poston agreed to pay $100,000 to settle the charges. Mr. Poston also agreed to be suspended from practicing as an accountant working on behalf of any publicly traded company or entity regulated by the SEC, the commission said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're pleased to have finalized the settlement and are happy to put this matter behind us," a Fifth Third spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cincinnati bank previously removed Mr. Poston from the CFO spot to be its chief strategy and administrative officer. He may apply for reinstatement in a year, the SEC said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifth Third said in early November that it had reached an agreement in principle with the SEC relating to an investigation into how the bank accounted for a portion of its commercial real-estate portfolio in a regulatory filing for the third quarter of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dispute focused on whether the bank should have classified certain loans as being "held for sale" in the third quarter of that year rather than in the fourth quarter. The bank had classified the loans as "held for investment" instead, and proper accounting would have boosted the company's pretax loss for the quarter by 132%, according to the SEC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifth Third said in November that it would agree to an SEC order finding that the company failed to properly account for a portion of the portfolio but won't admit or deny wrongdoing. On Wednesday, the SEC said the bank didn't admit to or deny the findings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of Fifth Third were down two cents at $19.97 Wednesday. The stock is up 31% so far this year. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy expanded at a "modest to moderate" pace in recent months, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday in a report that showed mixed economic conditions across the nation just weeks before a key policy decision by the central bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank's beige book, which assesses the economic environment in the Fed's 12 districts, cited strength in the U.S. manufacturing sector and consumer spending. Seven districts reported steady growth rates, while four districts indicated a less robust expansion than the others. One region simply said economic activity continued to expand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The snapshot, based on data gathered from early October through Nov. 22, comes two weeks before the Fed's Dec. 17-18 policy meeting. The Fed will decide at that meeting whether to start pulling back its $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program, which is aimed at lowering borrowing costs to spur stronger spending, hiring and growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uncertainty about the Fed's next steps remains a key risk hanging over investors and employers. Fed officials expect to start scaling back the program "in coming months," if the overall economy and labor market continue to improve, according to minutes from its last policy meeting in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate survey released Wednesday by the Business Roundtable, a group of top corporate executives, found CEOs the most bullish they've been about the economy in almost two years. The survey's economic-outlook index for the fourth quarter rose to its highest point since early 2012. Executives said clearer signals from Washington could help the economy accelerate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have an economy that is on the cusp of growing at more than the 2-to-3% we've seen," said <span class="companylink">Boeing Co</span>. CEO Jim McNerney, chairman of the group. "Washington sorting themselves out would give businesses a more predictable environment to invest the cash on their balance sheets and hire people."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will meet the CEOs at the Business Roundtable's quarterly meeting Thursday in Washington, as one of several speakers to talk with the executives. The event is closed to the public, and the roster of CEOs who plan to attend hasn't been released. The group has about 200 member CEOs from large companies, whose planning decisions could be influenced by the direction of interest rates and whose plans could influence the Fed's policy decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McNerney said the Fed would need to pull back on the pace of its monthly bond purchases at some point "for the well-being of our financial system."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They've chosen to keep interest rates very low, to keep the economy in a very highly liquid state," he said. "I think we're all mindful of the fact that tapering does need to happen somewhere along the line or we're going to have a very difficult inflationary environment here. Exactly when, we don't know."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall economy is starting to see stabilization in key areas after a turbulent summer. Sales of new homes picked up in October and inventory fell, according to a Commerce Department report released Wednesday, a sign the housing market may be stabilizing. Sales had slowed sharply during the summer partly due to spiking mortgage rates tied to the Fed's signals. New-home sales rose 25% in October from the prior month to an annual rate of 444,000. The surge returned sales to the brisk pace seen in the first half of the year before a summer rise in mortgage rates scared off prospective buyers. Sales had tumbled to an average annual pace of 369,000 in July through September, according to revised figures released Wednesday, down from an average pace of 445,000 in the first six months of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report Wednesday by payroll-processing firm <span class="companylink">Automatic Data Processing Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics found that U.S. businesses added more jobs in November than in any month this year. Private-sector jobs rose by 215,000 last month, while the October increase was revised to 184,000 from 130,000 reported a month ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists often use the ADP survey to get a feel for the much-watched monthly U.S. unemployment report from the Labor Department, which comes out Friday. Economists are forecasting that report will say non-farm payrolls added 180,000 jobs after increasing by 204,000 in October. The economists also expect the unemployment rate to inch down to 7.2% from 7.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's beige book found that the pace of hiring was unchanged or showed a modest increase across districts. "Difficulty with finding qualified workers, especially for high-skilled positions, was frequently reported," it said. Still, there was growth for jobs in construction, software, manufacturing and health care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers in many districts expressed "optimism" about near-term growth prospects, with activity expanding particularly in the automotive and high-technology industries, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending increased in almost all districts and retailers said they were "hopeful, but cautious" about the busy holiday season. But early reports since then, from the Thanksgiving shopping weekend, suggest consumers remain somewhat hesitant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tourism increased in most districts, although the 16-day partial federal government shutdown in October "had a negative impact in some areas," according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The residential housing market showed signs of strength in apartment construction, but there was some slowing in single-family home sales due to seasonal factors. Still, sales remain largely above year-ago levels, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banking conditions were largely stable, with some improvements in loan demand, the report said. Several districts reported an easing of lending standards</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall price pressures remained largely contained. But businesses in many districts voiced concern about future cost increases due to the Affordable Care Act and other types of federal regulation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes picked up in October and inventory fell, a sign the housing market may be stabilizing after a sharp summer slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales rose 25% in October from the prior month to an annual rate of 444,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That marked the sharpest monthly increase in more than three decades, though it came off a particularly weak September pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge returned sales to the brisk pace seen in the first half of the year before a summer rise in mortgage rates scared off prospective buyers. Sales had tumbled to an average annual pace of 369,000 in July through September, according to revised figures released Wednesday, down from an average pace of 445,000 in the first six months of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">October's activity caused the supply of homes on the market to contract sharply. Inventory fell to a 4.9-month supply, a historically low level. The tight supply coupled with the pickup in sales could lead home builders to ramp up construction in coming months, a development that would boost the overall U.S. recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a great deal of pent-up demand given that sales have been far below trend for the past six years," PNC chief economist Stuart Hoffman said in a note to clients. "Job gains, high affordability and gradually easing access to mortgage credit are also supporting sales of new homes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates rose more than a percentage point starting in late spring when the Federal Reserve first signaled it might reduce its monthly bond purchases. Since summer, rates have dipped but are still running above their record lows. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 4.29% last week, up from the 3.35% average registered in early May, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because new-home sales are tallied at the signing of a contract rather than at the closing, they can be an early indicator of housing-market trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revisions to earlier home-sales reports in June, July, and August showed that sales in each of those months were lower than initially forecast. New-home sales in September, meanwhile, stood 7.8% below the level of a year earlier, the first time in nearly two years that sales turned negative on a year-over-year basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs home builders are preparing for higher demand. A Commerce Department report last week showed housing permits surged in October to the highest level in more than five years. Permits for multifamily homes such as apartments and condominiums rose sharply while single-family permits climbed modestly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, other reports suggest the housing market isn't over its slump. Sales of previously owned homes fell for the second straight month in October, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. The trade group also reported that pending home sales fell for the fifth straight month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage applications have been falling in recent weeks, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>. And home-builder confidence was down in September and October compared with the summer, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications The latest data on new home sales is for October. An earlier version of this article incorrectly attributed this data to November. Also, an earlier version erroneously said the amount of time needed to deplete the inventory of homes, at 4.9 months, was at a record-low level. </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few things are as consistent in the U.S. home-building industry as the annual hope trade, in which investors bid up the stocks of home builders each winter in anticipation of a robust spring season for home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, the hope trade isn't a sure bet. While some analysts believe the trade will occur as usual and builder stocks again will outperform the broader stock market, others are warning that rising mortgage rates and turmoil on Capitol Hill will end the hope trade's decadelong run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We wouldn't buy the hope trade," said Stephen Kim, a <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> analyst who tracks home builders. "Not to say that it won't work, but we don't think it will work convincingly to be worth your while."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bearish case points to potentially stock-rattling deadlines in Washington, including one in January for Congress to renew government funding and another in February to address the federal debt ceiling. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is expected to keep investors on pins and needles about when it will start curtailing its easy-money policies, which will lead to increases in interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, slowing sales in recent months have left investors skittish about the industry's outlook for 2014 and 2015. Scottsdale, Ariz.-based <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>., which ranked as the ninth-largest builder in the U.S. by home sales last year, recently forecast that profit margins might top out and start to decline next year as land prices remain high for builders and the prices at which they sell their homes flatten or start to decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That type of margin squeeze typically doesn't materialize until much later in a recovery cycle for housing. "The bubble wasn't normal, the downturn wasn't normal and the recovery isn't normal either," said Mr. Kim. "The oddities of this cycle are more important at this point than the normal seasonal stuff," such as the hope trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alex Barron, president of the Housing Research Center, an El Paso, Texas-based firm that tracks home builder stocks, is also bearish on the hope trade. "I'm seeing some worrisome signs in the field," Mr. Barron said. "[Sales] incentives are going higher, builders are cutting prices, inventory is piling up. The reason you play the hope trade is that you hope next year is going to be better, but I don't see any reason for that hope this time around."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In years in which the hope trade occurs, it is noticeable. <span class="companylink">Raymond James &amp; Associates</span> analyst Buck Horne has tracked the hope trade and figures that in 23 of the past 29 years, an index of 17 home-builder stocks outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index from November 15 to January 31. Over that 29-year span, the stocks beat the S&amp;P by an average of 10 percentage points. For the past nine years, the gap averaged 11 percentage points, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Horne believes the tradition will continue and he is advising clients to hop on the hope-trade bandwagon. He says optimism about the spring selling season will overshadow concerns about interest rates, profit margins and federal standoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There always is concern about government, interest rates and the economy that come into play," Mr. Horne said. "People always are hopeful that there will be a more robust economy next year, more demand or that inventory starts to look better."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One factor favoring the bulls is that home-builder stocks are positioned for a rebound. They generally have traded at a discount to the S&amp;P 500 since May, when the Fed first started hinting that it would taper its $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program aimed at keeping interest rates low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index has bounced back by roughly 12.7% from its 2013 closing low on Sept. 5, it remains 20% below its high for the year, set May 14.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ISI Group analyst Stephen East forecasts that home builder stocks will rise in the next 12 to 24 months, but he adds that they will be buffeted in the short term by news on Fed tapering and job growth. As a group, the stocks are trading at about 1.6 times their current book value, whereas they typically trade at 1.8 to 2 times book value in recovery cycles, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Shaoul, chief executive of Marketfield Asset Management Inc., is optimistic about builder stocks even though he doesn't play the hope trade. His firm manages $18 billion in assets and holds positions in builders <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. "It's logical given the general improvement in the economy and employment and the [low] level that we're at today that the odds are for another acceleration in 2014," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pound held to its gains against the dollar and the euro after data showed U.K. construction output in November rose at the fastest pace since August 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sterling climbed to an intraday high of $1.6435, just below a 16-month high of $1.6444 reached Dec. 2. The pound recently bought $1.6392 compared with $1.6355 late Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro was trading at 0.8292 against the pound, just off a 10-month low of 0.8253 posted overnight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from Markit Tuesday provided further evidence of upward momentum in the U.K. economy as the construction purchasing managers index rose to 62.6 in November from October's 59.4. A figure above 50 indicates expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The outlook for the British pound remains positive," analysts at <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span><span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> said in a note to investors. "The latest leading indicators suggest the recovery is strengthening and the economy is expanding strongly in the fourth quarter."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, the yen pared some of the losses posted overnight against the dollar, with the buck trading just below ¥103. Yen weakness accelerated after a media report suggested the <span class="companylink">Bank of Japan</span> is working on contingency plans for further economic stimulus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By late afternoon, the euro was at $1.3591 from $1.3542 late Monday. The dollar fell to ¥102.40 versus ¥102.94.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Australian dollar rose to $0.9131 versus $0.9106 late Monday. The <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of Australia</span> left monetary policy unchanged, as expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ICE dollar index, a gauge of the currency's strength against six rivals, fell to 80.62 from 80.918 late Monday. The WSJ Dollar Index, which pits the greenback against a broader group of rivals, fell to 73.50 from 73.80.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Margherita Stancati and Nathan Hodge  </div><div>1119 words</div><div>3 December 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A9</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KABUL -- The asking price for a house in Kabul's toniest district nearly doubled a week ago, after it became clear that an Afghan assembly would endorse a new security deal with the U.S. A day later, when President Hamid Karzai insisted on delaying the critical pact, the price plummeted back to its previous level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everyone will flee if the security agreement is not signed. Everyone will stop renting houses," said Shafiqullah Mohammadi, who is handling the property. The 37-year-old real-estate agent said he plans to emigrate as well if the deal -- necessary to maintain U.S. troops and aid beyond 2014 -- isn't sealed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, Afghans and U.S. officials alike assumed that, despite Mr. Karzai's posturing, an agreement would eventually be reached. But now, they are beginning to confront the real possibility that American support may completely vanish in the coming months -- potentially precipitating the collapse of a state that has few other sources of sustenance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few politicians in Kabul voiced support for the president's stance. Even one of his brothers, Mahmood Karzai, has sounded an alarm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Already, this is damaging the economy a great deal -- the economy will completely collapse if it's not signed," said Mahmood Karzai, who was instrumental in President Karzai's 2009 re-election. "He has to sign it, he has no choice. If he doesn't, I think it will be very dangerous. People will mobilize against him."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loudest praise for Mr. Karzai came from the Taliban insurgents. "If he is sincere in his opposition, it seems he has realized the truth. May God make his opposition genuine and based on Afghan pride," the Taliban said on Monday. They added that a full U.S. withdrawal would "pave the ground for an understanding among Afghans."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time is running out: The White House last week said that the security deal must be signed by the end of this year or planning for the so-called zero option -- full withdrawal of the remaining U.S. forces from Afghanistan by Dec. 31, 2014 -- would begin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A complete pullout of American forces would jeopardize the combined $8 billion a year the U.S. and its Western allies have pledged to prop up the Afghan economy and pay for its army and police, according to the White House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The collapse of a similar agreement led the U.S. to withdraw all of its troops from Iraq in 2011. Since then, Iraq has suffered from an escalation of sectarian violence -- even though Iraq, unlike Afghanistan, can rely on oil wealth to pay for its own military.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We should learn from Iraq," said Sayed Sulaiman Ahmadi, a 21-year-old law student in Kabul. "Once we have a strong army we'll have no need for them, but right now we don't have anything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is another ominous precedent in Afghanistan itself: the precipitous collapse of the Soviet-backed regime of President Najibullah in 1992. His well-equipped forces fractured after Moscow's funding and fuel ran out, accelerating a devastating civil war that destroyed Kabul, drew in rival mujahedeen factions, and eventually brought the Taliban to power. "I see history repeating itself," said Fawzia Koofi, a prominent lawmaker from northeastern Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday, Mr. Karzai accused U.S. forces of withholding vitally needed fuel from Afghan troops to pressure him into signing the security deal. Though the coalition denied any interruption, the episode reminded the Afghans of how reliant their 350,000-strong security forces are on American backing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farhad, a carpet seller from Kabul who also goes by only one name, and who lived through the 1990s civil war, said Mr. Karzai needs to be aware of that reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He should sign the agreement because our people don't have good memories of our past rulers, the Taliban and the mujahedeen. It was anarchy at that time," Mr. Farhad said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same fears resonate with young Afghans who have no memory of the civil war. Women in particular worry that the hard-earned freedoms of the past 12 years would be at risk if the foreigners leave and international attention shifts away from Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Taliban may come back and Afghan girls won't be able to go to schools or universities," says Manizha Babak, a 15-year-old high-school student. "Afghanistan may no longer be a good place to live."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already this year, as Mr. Karzai was bargaining with the U.S. and putting forth new demands, the political uncertainty has exacted a toll on the fragile economy. The <span class="companylink">World Bank</span> projects that economic growth in Afghanistan will have slowed this year to just 3.1%, a steep drop from 14.4% last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western officials warn that without a bilateral security agreement, or <span class="companylink">BSA</span>, the economy would do even worse, precipitating a further exodus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</span> is preparing for a scenario in which some 200,000 people leave for neighboring countries next year, factoring in long-standing concerns about security surrounding elections as the current military mission winds down. But the number could be much higher if the U.S. pulls out completely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Karzai, whose successor is to be chosen in elections slated for April, shocked the Loya Jirga assembly last month by saying that the <span class="companylink">BSA</span> would have to be signed after the election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the Loya Jirga had approved it and urged a quick ratification, Mr. Karzai then issued a series of demands, saying that Washington must broker peace between his government and the Taliban, free Afghan prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and immediately end raids on Afghan homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all Afghans want the U.S. troops to stay. Ahmad Shah, a driver in the southern city of Kandahar, said that foreign forces were "one of the causes of instability" in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even among those who are skeptical about keeping a post-2014 U.S. troop presence, many insist that foreign funding for Afghanistan must continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need a relationship with the international community and especially with the United States," said Qutbuddin Hilal, one of the few presidential candidates who hasn't urged a quick signing of the security deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Karzai advisers, caught unaware by the president's decision, say they remain confident that he will endorse by the deal in time. "There will be a <span class="companylink">BSA</span>," said Omar Zakhilwal, his finance minister. "It is not a crisis."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.K. house prices surged in November and mortgage lending hit a five-year high in October, two separate surveys found Friday, a day after the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> cut its support for home loans in the U.K. amid anxiety over a surge in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales and prices and have risen sharply for much of 2013, supported by government programs encouraging banks to lend and the construction of new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.K. high street lender <span class="companylink">Nationwide</span>'s monthly house price index—which is based on the value of the new mortgages it provides each month—rose 0.6% on the month and by 6.5% on the year in November, pushing the average U.K. house price to £174,566 ($285,311). The November increase was the fastest annual rise in more than three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, <span class="companylink">Nationwide</span> said house prices rose 1.0% on the month and by 5.8% on the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Activity in the housing market has picked up strongly in recent months," <span class="companylink">Nationwide</span>'s Chief Economist Robert Gardner said. "Policy measures aimed at keeping down the cost and improving the availability of credit are also playing an important role. Indeed mortgage rates have declined significantly from the already-low levels prevailing last year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures from the BOE showed that gross mortgage lending was £15.7 billion in October, the highest level since October 2008. A further increase in mortgage approvals—a measure of mortgages that have been agreed to but have not yet been provided—suggests prices will rise further in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market is likely to continue improving," said Robert Wood, chief U.K. economist for Berenberg bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures come less than 24 hours after Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney announced that the Funding for Lending Scheme would be withdrawn for mortgages in January 2014. The program will remain open but will focus solely on business lending and continue to provide banks with access to cheaper funding to help increase the flow of credit to small businesses in particular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carney and the Financial Stability Committee said in the twice-yearly financial-stability report that the housing market no longer needs that level of support since activity and prices are both rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The move to end FLS support seems eminently sensible and we believe that it is very important that the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> is prepared to take further action to rein in the housing market if prices rise markedly amid ongoing strengthening activity," said Howard Archer, chief U.K. and euro zone economist for <span class="companylink">IHS</span> Global Insight. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not quite Alice in Wonderland, where the White Queen could believe six impossible things before breakfast. But the three <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> officials who sit on both the monetary and financial policy committees—Gov. Mark Carney and deputy governors Charles Bean and Jon Cunliffe—need to believe two fairly conflicting ideas about the U.K. housing market and its economic impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the BOE's Monetary Policy Committee unveiled its Inflation Report earlier in November, Mr. Carney sounded relatively untroubled by rising U.K. house prices and still-high levels of household debt. Given the importance of housing and consumption in the U.K. economy, this was where any recovery was bound to start. But come Thursday, when the Financial Policy Committee published its Financial Stability Report, Mr. Carney was announcing measures aimed at curbing the risks the housing market and mortgage lending might pose—the dark side of their importance to the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the MPC's guidance that interest rates will stick at 0.5% at least until unemployment falls to 7% and perhaps longer, the <span class="companylink">FPC</span>'s actions are welcome. Thursday's measures include a removal of incentives for household and mortgage lending under the BOE's Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) that provides cheap financing for banks. But it remains to be seen how much impact the changes, and other potential tools the <span class="companylink">FPC</span> can deploy, will have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arguably, the measures around the FLS are largely symbolic. Bank funding costs have fallen sharply since its introduction in 2012, helping to reduce mortgage costs, but that may have more to do with the sharp reduction in euro-zone tensions that occurred last year. Banks have drawn just £17.5 billion ($28.5 billion) under the program, and net lending has fallen. Other possible tools related to underwriting standards, bank capital and recommendations on revising the government's Help to Buy program might be more effective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these are largely untested. The experience of Switzerland, where the <span class="companylink">Swiss National Bank</span> has been forced to keep rates low while worrying about a housing bubble, is interesting in this light. The SNB has taken several steps last year and this to rein in the mortgage market. It is early days still, but Swiss house prices have continued to rise. <span class="companylink">UBS</span>'s Swiss Real Estate Bubble Index has risen further into the "risk" category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The test is yet to come for the U.K.: Will the recovery broaden so that business investment rises, making growth more balanced and sustainable? The increase in support for small companies under the FLS is welcome. But with interest rates ultralow and the government encouraging house purchases, the <span class="companylink">FPC</span>—and ultimately the MPC—might yet need to do more to cool the U.K. housing market.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is showing signs of stabilization as the year ends, but weaker consumer confidence and another jump in mortgage rates could spur renewed turbulence in the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing permits surged in October to the highest level in more than five years, driven largely by solid demand for multifamily buildings such as apartments and condominiums, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. And prices in most major U.S. cities rose in September, though more slowly than in prior months, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home-price index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market's clearly getting better," said Jed Kolko, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia Inc</span>., a real-estate firm. "The housing recovery has not stopped or gone into reverse."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector stumbled earlier this year partly due to a spike in mortgage rates after the Federal Reserve signaled it was looking to start reining in a bond-buying program that is meant to keep a lid on long-term rates. Activity started to recover once the Fed stood pat on its bond buying throughout the summer and into the fall. Still, a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.22% last week, compared with 3.35% in May, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest gauges showed demand firming in some areas. The number of building permits issued in October rose 6.2% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.034 million, the strongest pace since June 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits for multifamily units rose more than 15% in October, while single-family permits rose modestly and reversed some of their summer decline. The single-family segment is considered a steadier gauge of the underlying health of the housing market. Stronger permits can signal builder optimism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, home prices in 20 major U.S. cities rose a seasonally adjusted 1% in September from August and 13.3% year-over-year, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other threats could weigh on the housing market, including relatively modest job growth and weaker spending. Consumer confidence fell in November to its weakest reading since April, according to a report Tuesday by the Conference Board, a business research group. Economists had expected the index would bounce back after declines in October tied to the federal government shutdown and debt-ceiling fight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 16-day shutdown also delayed the housing data. The Commerce Department didn't release figures for the more closely watched housing starts because "accurate data" couldn't be collected in time. The agency will release a full residential construction report for September, October and November on Dec. 18.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to another record thanks to good news from the housing market, as traders looked ahead to the midweek Thanksgiving holiday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow industrials finished up just 0.26 point at 16072.80. Earlier in the session, the blue-chip average was up by many as 48 points. The small gain allowed the 30-stock gauge to eke out its 11th record close this month and its 43rd of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P 500 index ended the day nearly unchanged, gaining 0.27 point to 1802.75, with consumer-discretionary and technology shares leading gains in just three of 10 sector groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 23.18 points, or 0.6%, to 4017.75, finishing above 4000 for the first time in 13 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The moves aren't vibrant, but positive after good news on housing," said Lawrence Creatura, portfolio manager of the $500 million Federated Clover Small Value Fund. "This is a quiet moment during a quiet week, with investors reviewing where they stand and preparing for the post-Thanksgiving push," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Creatura said he has been reviewing notes from industry conferences and looking for stocks he views as mispriced. "There are many good companies and many inexpensive companies, but not many good and inexpensive companies," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commerce Department data showed demand for home-building permits jumped 6.2% in October to an adjusted annual rate of 1.034 million, the highest level in more than five years. Economists had projected a rise to a pace of 930,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller 20-city home-price index for September rose 13.3% on the year, slightly better than expectations for a gain of 13%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This shows the housing sector is still moving along in the right direction and not rolling over," said Nick Sargen, chief investment officer at <span class="companylink">Fort Washington Investment Advisors</span>, which has about $45 billion in assets under management. "The sector is critical to the overall recovery story, so it is good to see some positive news."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>'s consumer-confidence index for November unexpectedly fell to 70.4 from 71.2 in October. Economists expected the index to show a rise to 73.0. The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said uncertainty about future employment and income prospects could make this a challenging holiday season for retailers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Art Hogan, managing director at brokerage firm Lazard Capital Markets, said he isn't expecting a lot of action ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, as a seasonally strong period for stocks bumps up against investors' urge to start realizing their gains for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've got a pretty good reason for the market to trade sideways for the rest of this week," Mr. Hogan said. "With the market trading at record highs, we would need a catalyst" to get the market moving again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.696% from 2.741% late Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European markets were lower. The Stoxx Europe 600 slid 0.6%, after closing Monday at the second-highest level of the year. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index lost 0.9%, Germany's DAX 30 dropped 0.1% and France's CAC 40 gave up 0.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In currency markets, the dollar lost ground against the euro and the yen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Front-month January oil futures erased earlier gains, slipping 0.4% to settle at $93.68 a barrel, while gold futures were little changed, rising less than 0.1% to $1,241.40 an ounce after settling Monday at a 4 1/2-month low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan's Nikkei Stock Average fell 0.7% to snap a three-session winning streak in which the index jumped 3.6%. It was off another 0.4% in early-Wednesday trading. China's Shanghai Composite slipped 0.1% Tuesday for its fourth-straight loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In corporate news, shares of <span class="companylink">Barnes &amp; Noble</span> sank 98 cents, or 6%, to $15.45 after the book retailer reported revenue declined more than expected.</p>

</div><div class="author">Candace Taylor </div><div>1284 words</div><div>27 November 2013</div><div>14:19</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Baron Jean-Pierre Potet bought a 50-room, Louis XIII-style château in the French countryside 40 years ago, it was empty. Occupied by German soldiers during World War II, the castle had been looted, with nearly all of its furnishings stolen, Mr. Potet said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luckily for him, he said, it was Frenchmen who did the stealing. That meant he's been able to retrieve nearly all of the castle's furnishings by trolling antique stores in the area, using old photos as a guide. The castle, where Mr. Potet lives with his wife Corinne and their two children, now looks much as it did a century ago, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mr. Potet is putting the nearly 38,000-square-foot castle and all of its furnishings on the market for about $17.1 million. Known as the "Château de Villersexel," it has some 30 bedrooms and 15 bathrooms. The property, where the Potets run a boutique hotel, is on about 74 acres and includes horse stables and a working farm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Château de Villersexel is in northeast France, near the Swiss border. For centuries, it had been the seat of the Grammonts, a noble French family. The castle was destroyed twice, Mr. Potet said: once around the year 1,000, and again in the Battle of Villersexel in 1871, during the Franco-Prussian War. During World War II, the Marquis de Grammont took part in the French Resistance, ultimately dying in the concentration camp at Dachau, according to Mr. Potet (who can trace his family line back to Charlemagne, but is no relation to the Grammonts). After the war, with the Germans gone, the castle was abandoned and ripe for looting, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the founders of the L'Ecole des Métiers de la Communication, a graduate school with locations throughout the world, Mr. Potet purchased the castle from the Grammont family in 1976 for an undisclosed sum. At the time, he said, he "wanted to run away from Paris" and was looking for a simpler life. Now he says he's selling because he wants a smaller place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Xavier Attal of Paris-based Immo Best International has the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Ty Cobb was a teenager, his father wrote him a letter extolling the beauties of nature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To be educated is not only to be master of the printed page but [to] be able to catch the messages of star, rock, flower, [and] bird," W.H. Cobb wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a message the baseball Hall of Famer carried with him throughout his life, according to his granddaughter, Leslie McLaren. And nowhere was her grandfather's love of nature more in evidence, she said, than at his hunting and fishing lodge on Lake Tahoe. The lodge "was really the place that grandfather came home to himself," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lakefront house, which Mr. Cobb purchased in 1938 after retiring from baseball, is now being sold by Ms. McLaren and other members of his family. The 2,438-square-foot, four-bedroom, four-bathroom house on a 2¼-acre site in Zephyr Cove is listed for $6.5 million with David Cloutier of Coldwell Banker Select Real Estate. Ms. McLaren declined to discuss the reasons for selling the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property has 147 feet of lake frontage, with two buoys for boats, Mr. Cloutier said. He added that there are two other buildable lots on the site. "Having this land mass with this lake waterfront is very unique" in the area, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. McLaren, who was 12 when Mr. Cobb died, said she has fond memories of spending summers with him at Lake Tahoe. She remembers her grandfather, who grew up on a farm in Georgia, "loving nature, loving the out-of-doors," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially, the house was a "little bitty cabin," Ms. McLaren said. There was a master bedroom and three smaller bedrooms, she said, though she and her siblings often slept outside in tents on summer nights. A great room, with a large granite fireplace, was decorated with "all sorts of skins and heads" from animals her grandfather had hunted, she recalled. The family enlarged and modernized the house in 1992, and while the animal pelts are gone, the fireplace is still there with the original andirons, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Normandy House, a historic Hamptons estate that hit the market two years ago at $39 million, has sold for $28 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal closed earlier this month, according to <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>'s Don Gleasner, who represented the seller, Richard Burdge, a onetime president of the American Stock Exchange and a former executive vice president of Cigna. Corcoran agent Tim Davis, who represented the buyer, declined to identify the purchaser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burdge purchased the Southampton property in 1998, Mr. Gleasner said. Called "Normandy House" for its French-style architecture and steeply pitched gray shingle roof, the six-bedroom, 8,000-square-foot house was designed in 1923 by architects Polemus &amp; Coffin, and took seven years to build. The 8.4-acre property also has a matching three-bedroom, 2,000-square-foot guesthouse as well as a pool and pool house. "The gates open and you see this huge expanse, this lovely long driveway lined with apple trees," Mr. Gleasner said. "It's a very grand, beautiful entrance."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apart from its distinctive architecture, Mr. Gleasner said the property is unique for its location on Lake Agawam, which provides "views up and down the lake and out to the ocean," he said. Mr. Davis added that the estate was one of the largest parcels available on the lake. The property can be subdivided if the buyers choose, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for why it took so long to sell, Mr. Gleasner said, "at the beginning, since it's such a unique property and there's nothing else like it, we weren't sure how to price it," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property was "a sleeper on the market," Mr. Davis said. "Finally, the right person saw it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Donovan, star of the television spy drama "Burn Notice," is selling a three-bedroom, 2½-bathroom condo in Miami's South Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment, located in the three-building Capri South Beach on 16th Street, is listed for $2.95 million with Alexandra Rutten of ONE <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Donovan bought the 2,000-square foot apartment in 2010 from the developer, and was the first person to live in the unit, Ms. Rutten said. But "Burn Notice," which had been filmed in Miami, recently completed its final season, and Mr. Donovan and his family have now moved out West, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I had started a family with my wife and the show ended, so it was time to move back to nature," Mr. Donovan said in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Donovan's apartment is in the "Ana Capri" building. With its own entrance and garage, Ms. Rutten said, the building is "very intimate." A keyed elevator opens directly into each unit. The condo comes with two parking spaces Mr. Donovan owns, Ms. Rutten said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Donovan said he was drawn to the seclusion offered by the building. "I wanted privacy," he wrote. "Having your elevator open to your home made me feel really safe."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After moving in, Mr. Donovan said he made significant changes to the unit. "We wanted to soften the modern, travertine look with a New England feel, so we dropped the ceiling and installed wood paneling," he wrote. Another one of his favorite features, he said, is the view of Biscayne Bay from the apartment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The term "bed-and-breakfast" is no longer code for teddy bears, floral bedspreads and doilies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karen Lynch, a 49-year-old former stay-at-home mom, and her husband Dan, a 56-year-old IT specialist at <span class="companylink">Chevron</span>, recently invested nine months and $600,000 gutting an 1860 Victorian home, purchased for $1.5 million. They kept the historic wainscoting and hardwood floors, but replaced the old-fashioned décor with more modern equivalents. Named the Inn on Randolph, the B&amp;B opened in May 2012 and costs $225 to $425 a night. The couple live next door in a restored, 1,600-square-foot bungalow that backs up to the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February 2007, Raymond Brunyanszki and his partner Oscar Verest bought what was originally a carpenter's home in the 1870s for $2.8 million. They then spent an additional $2 million on renovations, which included adding a restaurant, reconfiguring the layout and shipping furniture from Italy, Belgium and Spain. Called the Camden Harbour Inn in Maine, the inn's priciest rooms run around $1,500 a night during high season and are decorated with all-white walls accented by pops of color like purple and orange. "People will change their entire itinerary if these rooms are booked," says Mr. Brunyanszki, a 44-year old former hospitality consultant, who adds that guests have included members of Boyz II Men.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fresh look reflects the vitality of the bed-and-breakfast industry, which is attracting a new breed of innkeepers who, instead of being hobbyists, are looking for sustainable businesses. Today there are 15,000 B&amp;Bs in the U.S., up from estimates of between 5,000 and 8,000 in the 1980s and early 1990s, says Jay Karen, CEO of the Professional Association of Innkeepers International (PAII), a B&amp;B trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bed-and-breakfasts, which grew in popularity in the 1800s as mainstays for travelers, usually were family-run enterprises offering a handful of rooms. They cropped up in rural areas too remote to support larger hotels and often distinguished themselves with homey vibes. "People liked the idea of welcoming the weary traveler and showing off their cooking skills or the antiques they collected over the years," Mr. Karen says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of B&amp;Bs reached a peak of 20,000 between 2000 and 2005, until a generation of aging innkeepers retired and the economic downturn made it more difficult for aspiring new owners to secure financing. But the category proved remarkably resilient in terms of demand. While hotels suffered, the average daily rates at bed-and-breakfasts have increased each year for the past seven years. The median average daily rate in 2012 was $161 a night, compared with $138 in 2006, according to the innkeepers association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now interest in opening an inn is returning. Peter Scherman, a Virginia-based broker with the B&amp;B Team, a brokerage and inn consultancy, says several years ago his group had to cancel seminars because of a lack of interest. This year, the seminars, which range from a $99 one-day workshop to a $495 per couple weekend workshop, quickly sold out. The group has 14 seminars planned for 2014—twice the number it ran a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many bed-and-breakfasts are budget-priced, more newer B&amp;Bs are focused on upscale travelers, with rates easily running upward of $1,000 a night. Around 10% of B&amp;Bs have rates that top $300 per night, according to PAII, particularly during high seasons. And while it was usually the case that owners would share the common areas of the B&amp;Bs with their guests, many of the owners of these luxury properties live in separate, if sometimes smaller, quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sylvia Muller, 59, who owns the Mill House Inn in East Hampton, N.Y., with her husband Gary, 56, initially lived in the main house of the B&amp;B and shared the inn's kitchen. "That can really burn you out, not having privacy," Mrs. Muller says. While they don't live on the property full time, they are renovating a suite at the inn for themselves so they can have their own space to cook and entertain when they are there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help justify its nightly rates of $750 to $1,695 per night during high season, the four-room, six-suite inn, which also has a separate cottage for rent, lets guests choose from more than a dozen entrees for breakfast. Guest refrigerators are stocked with cheeses, charcuterie plates, specialty ginger ales and coconut water. The 18-person staff can arrange treasure hunts for kids and lobster roasts on the beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After he lost his job during the economic downturn, Mike Amery decided to turn his own 10,000-square-foot home and carriage house into a B&amp;B called the Inn at Bowman's Hill in New Hope, Pa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the 69-year-old former pharmaceutical executive is investing about $150,000 in the addition of two large suites to bring his room number to a total of eight. The new suites, which will go for $700 to $800 a night, will have fireplaces, decks, steam showers and starlight ceilings, which use fiber optics to create a starry night sky. While the new suites will represent 25% of his inn size, Mr. Amery expects them to generate as much as 35% of the revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the addition of the two suites, Mr. Amery created a small bedroom with an en suite bathroom, a sitting room and a closet for his personal use. He says his home is definitely primarily a business with a space to live, unlike many B&amp;Bs where the guest space is secondary. Although his area is very small, "the upside is that I get to enjoy the beautiful grounds and surroundings," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the number of inns is growing, the business-side of a B&amp;B remains risky. Even before a B&amp;B opens, many owners sink hundreds of thousands of dollars into a property—with no guarantee of a substantial profit. The risks are even higher for a luxury B&amp;B, as owners must invest even more capital. Mr. Scherman, the inn consultant, says the industry doesn't track the failure rate of B&amp;Bs but that overleveraging and overpaying have "come back to cause failures on a fairly large scale."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We now are getting to the break-even point," says Mr. Brunyanszki, co-owner of Camden Harbour Inn, which cost millions to purchase, renovate and equip. "But we're looking at expanding and adding facilities so we continue to invest."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took Mike and Linda Rydson nearly three years to open their Melbourne Beach, Fla., bed-and-breakfast. The couple bought the 97-year-old home for $550,000 in 2004. Though the home had hardwood floors and beadboard walls, vines wove through the interior and the floors were uneven, with one side of the home being about 4 inches above the other. "Linda thought it was quaint, but I said if people have two glasses of wine they'll tip right over," says Mr. Rydson, 49, who previously worked as a mechanical engineer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their first hurdle, as is often the case, was petitioning the town's commission to approve a B&amp;B in an area zoned as residential. "It took a lot of convincing because a B&amp;B wasn't an allowable use for the property," Mr. Rydson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents say there are many historic homes that could be potential B&amp;Bs but that it is difficult to market them as such because changing a residential property to commercial one requires a zoning variance. "I can't even put the suggestion of a B&amp;B into copy," says Jud Henderson, a real-estate agent in Princeton, N.J., who says he has several historic properties that would be good candidates for B&amp;Bs. He says some prospective buyers are enticed with the idea of turning a home into an inn, but then make "one phone call and we never hear from them again."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the town approved the use of the Rydsons' property, the couple was able to begin renovating and expanding, which cost another $1 million. In December 2007, they finally opened the doors of their Caribbean-esque, 10-room B&amp;B called Port d'Hiver. With a 60% year-round occupancy rate—the industry average occupancy rate is 40%—Mr. Rydson says the inn doesn't have a high or low season. The couple keeps rates at $279 to $519 a night throughout the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When undertaking renovations, B&amp;B owners have special considerations. Zoned heating doesn't work because each bedroom needs its own thermostat and soundproofing can "cost a fortune," says Mr. Amery of the Inn at Bowman's Hill. He says he spent $50,000 to $100,000 per room to upgrade his property. He added deadbolts and peepholes to each door and lighting dimmers and fireplaces in each room. "You have to consider things people don't think about when constructing a private residence," Mr. Amery says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many B&amp;B owners compare running a successful inn to the arduous task of opening a restaurant. Some owners forgo staff to turn a profit quicker, while others decide to spend money on employees to expand their inn or offer a higher level of service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, what sets luxury B&amp;B owners apart is the constant upkeep. Even though Mrs. Lynch's inn has only been open for 18 months, she plans to shut it down for three weeks in January to replace a few bathtubs, update some of the furniture and repaint rooms. She and her husband have allocated $50,000 each year for maintenance. "Every year you're looking with a critical eye and saying 'I know I painted this a year ago but let's do it again,' " she says. "Each guest is seeing it for the first time." </p>

</div><div class="author">Anita Likus </div><div>753 words</div><div>26 November 2013</div><div>14:41</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial-property sales in Germany are expected to climb to a post-financial-crisis high this year as the country lures investors seeking higher yields than are available in Europe's most desirable cities, like Paris and London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of deals this year is expected to hit €30 billion ($40.6 billion), an 18.6% increase from 2012, according to property advisory <span class="companylink">Savills PLC</span>. Transaction levels are still below the €52.2 billion recorded in 2007 but above the €10.8 billion in 2009, the weakest postcrisis year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase this year comes as Germany also is seeing mergers and acquisitions among listed companies and consolidations of investment-management funds. Meanwhile, there is greater availability of debt and equity financing, according to Marcus Lemli, head of Germany at <span class="companylink">Savills</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial-property buyers include pension funds, insurers and hedge funds that are attracted to Germany's stable economy. Germany's economy is expected to expand by 0.5% this year and 1.4% next year, according to the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span>, while the country's 5.2% unemployment rate is the lowest since 1991.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors also are looking for higher yields than they can find in the most popular European markets. For example, average office-building yields in Germany are at 6.9%, compared with 5.8% in the U.K. and 6.4% in France.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Hedge funds we haven't seen before have showed up," said Keith Breslauer, managing director at private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Patron Capital Partners</span>, which plans to spend €1 billion on German real estate in the next couple of years. "Two years ago there were five bidders on an income-producing asset; there are now 25 bidders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During most of the downturn investors preferred fully leased buildings with solid cash flows. But investors are now also looking at empty buildings or those needing refurbishing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patron Capital is close to purchasing two buildings, both 40% empty. Mr. Breslauer said he can find good opportunities outside of the main city centers and financial districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign buyers have come to Germany from the U.S., the U.K. and Asia. The market is still dominated by domestic buyers, but international investors from 21 different countries have purchased commercial properties with a value above €1 million in Germany in 2013, property adviser CBRE said, adding that 39% of total investment in Frankfurt came from non-Europeans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, a group of six Korean investors, most of which never before invested in Germany, purchased the Gallileo Tower in Frankfurt for €250 million. A joint venture of <span class="companylink">Axa Real Estate Investment Managers</span> and <span class="companylink">Norges Bank</span> Investment Management earlier this month said it is buying the headquarters of German newspaper <span class="companylink">Süddeutscher Verlag</span> for €164.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany can be tricky for foreign investors because the country doesn't have one central hub. There are six large cities to choose from: Munich, Berlin, Frankfurt, Düsseldorf, Hamburg and Cologne.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">German-listed real-estate companies also are getting more attention as companies grow through mergers and acquisitions and others go public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest residential player, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Annington Immobilien SE</span>, listed in Germany in July. Rival residential company <span class="companylink">LEG Immobilien AG</span> listed in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you want to be on the radar of big investors, you have to be big," said Jan Linsin, head of research at CBRE.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listed real-estate giant <span class="companylink">Deutsche Wohnen AG</span>, with a €5.3 billion portfolio of residential, commercial and nursing-care assets, has made an all-share bid for Berlin-focused residential-property company <span class="companylink">GSW Immobilien AG</span>, with €3.3 billion of assets. More than 91% of GSW's shareholders accepted the offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The takeover will create one of Germany's largest property groups, with 150,000 residential units and an €8.5 billion portfolio, and finally put a German real-estate company on a par with much larger European peers such as Paris-based <span class="companylink">Unibail-Rodamco SE</span> or the U.K.'s <span class="companylink">Land Securities Group PLC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We started the consolidation in Germany's listed property market because we want to grow and become more attractive to foreign investors," said a spokeswoman for <span class="companylink">Deutsche Wohnen</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the real-estate fund side, Internos Global Investors, which currently manages €2 billion of assets, announced earlier in November that it purchased the €1.6 billion real-estate Spezialfonds business CRS, comprising nine funds, from Commerz Real. Internos didn't disclose the price.</p>

</div><div class="author">Ryan Tracy </div><div>539 words</div><div>26 November 2013</div><div>11:01</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—The U.S. banking industry continued its recovery during the third quarter, reflecting the sector's gradual rebound from the financial crisis, the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FDIC said it found "positive trends" in compiling the latest financial reports from across the industry, with overall growth in commercial and consumer lending except for a slowdown in the pace of mortgage loans. <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>.'s legal woes weighed on the figures, accounting for the bulk of a $1.5 billion drop in industry-wide earnings for the third quarter of 2013 compared with the same period a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without identifying the bank, FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg said the overall earnings decline was "mainly attributable" to litigation expenses at one institution. <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>, the largest U.S. bank by assets, posted a loss in the third quarter after it set aside more than $9 billion to cover potential litigation costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FDIC said banks reduced the amount of troubled loans on their books and notched growth in the balances of most categories of loans, including auto, credit card, and commercial and industrial loans. Overall, loan balances rose by $69.7 billion, or nearly 1% above the previous quarter, to $7.80 trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Originations for residential real-estate loans were down by $136.8 billion, or 30%, from the previous quarter, the report said, reflecting a drop in demand. Income from mortgages sales, securitization and servicing was lower this quarter compared with the third quarter of 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While business and commercial real-estate lending remain bright spots for banks, onetime events and a significant pullback in mortgage originations have put a damper on earnings," said James Chessen, chief economist for the American Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gruenberg said the slowdown in the mortgage market "is going to be the ongoing issue" affecting bank income going forward. The housing sector's resurgence has slowed in recent months as higher home prices and mortgage interest rates have tamped down demand, along with short supplies of homes for sale in some parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks boosted earnings by putting away fewer dollars to cover potential losses—a trend that has concerned regulators in the past. The FDIC said banks set aside $5.8 billion in provisions against loan losses during the third quarter, a 60% drop from the same period last year and the smallest amount in any quarter since 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gruenberg noted, however, that the amount of problem loans also declined for the fourth straight quarter, resulting in an increase in the percentage of troubled loans covered by loan-loss reserves in the quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Asset quality continues to improve, loan balances are up, and the numbers of unprofitable institutions, problem banks and bank failures continue to decline," Mr. Gruenberg said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FDIC said six institutions failed in the third quarter and 23 have failed this year, including one that failed after the fourth quarter started. In the first three quarters of 2012, 43 banks failed. The number of federally designated "problem banks" dropped as well for the tenth consecutive quarter.</p>

</div><div class="author">Kosaku Narioka </div><div>604 words</div><div>26 November 2013</div><div>05:15</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO—Land prices in Japan's major cities continued their longest rising streak since the global financial crisis as demand for commercial and residential properties increased at most locations, a sign that the nation's economic recovery is taking root.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A government survey, released Tuesday. showed that land prices in the country's major urban areas increased in more than two-thirds of the places surveyed in the July-September period, underscoring a gradual but steady recovery trend in Japan's real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After remaining dormant for years following the collapse of Japan's asset bubble in the early 1990s, the property market has been showing signs of life recently. The rising trend has likely been accelerated by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's pro-growth policies, property buying in anticipation of a sales-tax increase next spring and Tokyo's successful bid for the 2020 Olympics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Shifts toward rising trends continue to be observed broadly," the survey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Improved economic sentiment resulting from the <span class="companylink">Bank of Japan</span>'s monetary-easing program—part of the prime minister's effort to revitalize the economy—and expectations for higher interest rates ahead are driving people to buy real estate, a land ministry official said. He played down the impact of residential buying in anticipation of April's sales-tax rise, saying the effects of so-called rush-demand are still limited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quarterly survey of residential and commercial land prices by the ministry showed that of 150 areas, mainly in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya, prices rose in 107 locations, up from 99 in the previous survey. Prices were flat in 34 areas, down from 41 in the previous survey, while they fell in 9 areas, down from 10.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial real-estate investment in Japan this year has already outstripped the total for the whole of 2012, according to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, a U.S. commercial real-estate services provider. The firm said that as of the end of September, investment has totaled ¥2.84 trillion ($27.9 billion) for the year so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At auctions, good properties are being sold at prices that are higher than the asking prices," said Satoshi Horino, president of Mori Trust Asset Management Co.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Horino said he doesn't necessarily share the sense of enthusiasm currently seen in some corners of the market, he said the prospect of better Japanese corporate earnings and a broader economic recovery means real- estate prices will rise from current levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keisuke Yanagimachi, head of research for Japan at Cushman &amp; Wakefield, said Tokyo's successful bid for the 2020 Olympics has also increased expectations for the city's property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that in coming years, infrastructure investment will take place to improve public transportation in preparation for the Olympics, creating more attractive locations in town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Olympics will give a boost to the city's revival," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government survey covers Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya, as well as intensively used land in other major cities. Of the areas surveyed, 65 were in the Tokyo region. A couple of residential locations in Kyoto, Japan's former capital, showed price gains for the first time since 2007, as did a commercial zone in the northern city of Sendai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the exception of two years, Japan's overall land prices have fallen every year since 1991. A government survey showed earlier this year that overall land prices fell for the fifth straight year in 2012, but by just 1.8%, the slowest pace since 2008.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices rose 0.7% in September, posting their smallest monthly gain since last February, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home price report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the year-over-year gain of 13.3% was "the strongest since the [housing] boom peaked in 2006," the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gauge of home prices indicated that weaker sales are unable to maintain the strong gains posted earlier in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On an unadjusted basis, prices for the 10 major U.S. cities and the 20 major cities increased 0.7% in September over August. Seasonally adjusted, the gain was 0.9% for the 10-city composite and 1.0% for the 20-city index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the year ended in September, the 10-city index jumped 13.3% on an unadjusted basis, and the 20-city index also advanced 13.3%, slightly better than the 13.0% expected by economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, soaring prices in the West have left some to wonder whether they are rising too fast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas continues to lead price gains, with home values up 29.1% year-over-year. San Francisco has seen prices rise 25.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The strong price gains in the West are sparking questions and concerns about the possibility of another bubble," the report said, "However, the talk is focused on fear of a bubble, not a rush to join the party and buy. Moreover, other data suggest a market beginning to shift to slower growth rather than one about to accelerate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller data comes on the heels of mixed housing data so far this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported building permits rose in both September and October, with the October data reaching its highest level June 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported Monday that pending home sales fell in October for the fifth consecutive month, with higher home prices and financing costs seen dulling demand. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Data as of approximately 5 p.m. ET)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SNAPSHOT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks failed to hold onto early gains and finished mixed. The nuclear deal between Iran and world powers weighed on oil and gold, and spurred the U.S. dollar to a six-month high against the Japanese yen. Treasurys saw modest gains after two indicators pointed to a sputtering economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OPENING CALL</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday begins a big week of news flow for Japan with the release of minutes from the <span class="companylink">Bank of Japan</span>'s latest policy meeting, where members unanimously voted to continue pumping Y60 trillion to Y70 trillion annually into the country's financial system. Retail, jobs and housing data will hit the wires later in the week, but it's Friday's inflation numbers BOJ watchers will have an eye out for, as well as any indication the country is closer to its goal for 2% inflation by 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EQUITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks pared most of their intraday gains to end mixed, while the Nasdaq Composite Index breached 4000 for the first time in 13 years, but failed to sustain that level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks pushed higher early in the session, as investors were buoyed by a deal to curb Iran's nuclear program that knocked oil prices lower. Traders said the rally lost its momentum late in the trading day amid thin trading volumes due to the holiday week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's just not much alacrity in the market or conviction either way," said Gordon Charlop, managing director at <span class="companylink">Rosenblatt Securities</span>. "It's got a holiday feel."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In light of the fact that you have fewer people around, modestly positive news such as the Iran deal becomes more positive," said Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG. "All else equal, lower oil prices are better than higher oil prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In corporate news, <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney</span> rose, shrugging off news late Friday that S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices would strike the retailer's stock from the benchmark S&amp;P 500 Index and move it to the S&amp;P MidCap 400.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Asian trading Monday, stocks finished higher, with the yen's continued weakness boosting shares in Tokyo, while a deal to ease sanctions on Iran pushed the price of oil lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOREX</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. dollar rose to a six-month high against the Japanese yen, after a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers reduced demand for perceived safe-haven currencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The greenback jumped to Y101.92 against the yen, its highest level since May 29, after the U.S. and five other countries reached a deal on Sunday to ease some economic sanctions against Iran in exchange for Iran freezing parts of its nuclear program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said the deal helped alleviate geopolitical tensions, pushing investors out of safe-haven assets such as the yen and into riskier assets like stocks. The Swiss franc, another favorite safe haven in currency markets, also fell 0.6% against the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before Monday, the yen had been steadily weakening against the dollar in recent weeks. Fresh warnings from Japanese authorities that they would fight the strong yen, coupled with improving U.S. economic data, have caused the yen to lose 4.4% against the dollar in the past month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everybody I talk to has the trade on in some shape or form," said Brad Bechtel, managing director at Faros Trading in Stamford, Conn., referring to the short yen trade. "More and more of the market believes in the trade and is jumping on it."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasurys posted modest gains after two indicators pointed to a sputtering economy, easing some investors' fears that the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> will begin to cut back on its stimulus efforts as soon as next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Fed</span> has said it will maintain its $85 billion-a-month bond buying program until the economy has returned to sustainable growth and job creation. Monday's data suggesting sagging growth relieved worries that the Fed would soon begin to taper such purchases, which have helped keep yields low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. pending home sales fell 0.6% in October to 102.1, the lowest level in nearly a year, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, while economists had expected a 1.1% increase. The index has fallen for five months in a row due of higher housing prices and mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas</span> reported its headline manufacturing index fell from October's 3.6 to 1.9, the lowest reading since March, suggesting a continued slowdown in the region's manufacturing activity. Economists had anticipated an improvement to 5.0.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Monday's sale of $32 billion in two-year Treasury notes got an average reception from investors, with non-dealer bidders taking 49.8% of the total offer, compared with the average 49.5% from the past four auctions, according to CRT Capital LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COMMODITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold futures fell as investors had their first chance to respond to the historic deal on limiting nuclear proliferation reached between Iran and six world powers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold's declines came as optimism over the deal saw some investors who hold the metal as a hedge against geopolitical uncertainty reduce those stakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil futures also fell on the Iran news, amid expectations that more crude oil will flow to the global market as a result of the agreement. Some investors buy gold as a hedge against inflation, and keep an eye on oil prices, as energy costs are a key component of inflation measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Inflation is off the table with the lower energy prices," said Frank McGhee, head precious metals dealer with Integrated Brokerage Services, a Chicago-based brokerage. "Gold is just going to continue its grind down," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, futures pared their steepest losses by the time Comex floor trading closed, as the Iran nuclear developments have not been a major factor for the precious metals market in the first place, said Bob Haberkorn, a senior commodities broker with RJO Futures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think this Iran news will be short lived in the precious metals market," he said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—A gauge of upcoming home sales fell in October for the fifth straight month, the latest sign that higher prices and borrowing costs are denting the housing rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday that its seasonally adjusted index of pending sales of existing homes fell 0.6% in October from the prior month to 102.1, the lowest level in nearly a year. Economists had forecast a 1.1% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales are a leading indicator of housing-market conditions because they tally sales at the moment contracts are signed. The drop in contract signings, which occur a month or two ahead of closings, suggests home-sales activity will remain weak in the final months of this year. The Realtors group last week said existing-home sales, its measure of closed transactions, fell for the second consecutive month in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It looks like the surge in housing is behind us," said Joel L. Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent home-sales declines show that the housing sector, which had been a driver of the economic recovery, is struggling to digest the recent run-up in mortgage rates. Rates began rising this spring when the Federal Reserve signaled it would like to begin reining in its $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program. A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stood at 4.22% last week, up from 3.54% in May, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising housing prices in hot housing markets have further stretched affordability for prospective buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in 20 major U.S. cities were up 12.8% in the year through August, the largest gain since early 2006, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home-price index. Economists forecast new data out Tuesday will show a 13.1% rise in the index for the year ended in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> economist Lawrence Yun said the federal government's 16-day shutdown depressed October home sales by weighing on buyer confidence. It also prevented some buyers from obtaining government-backed loans and <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> verification of their income. "The government shutdown in the first half of the month sidelined some potential buyers," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey by the trade group found that 17% of Realtors reported delays for their sales transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risk of another government shutdown next year and the implementation of new federal regulations, designed to ensure mortgage applicants can repay their loans, also could slow sales, Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite slowing sales in recent months, the Realtors group forecasts total existing-home sales of 5.1 million this year, up 10% from 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other recent economic data have been more positive. Job creation and retail sales both strengthened last month, while the overall economy expanded at a 2.8% annual rate in the third quarter from 2.5% in the second.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed officials will next meet on Dec. 17-18 to evaluate whether the economy is strong enough for the central bank to start reducing the pace of its monthly bond purchases. The latest housing data "are a reason for the Fed to remain cautious" about slowing the bond-buying, said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minutes of the Fed's October policy meeting, released last week, showed officials planning to end the bond-buying program "in coming months" and devising a message to the public to soften the impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The officials are anxious to avoid a repeat of the market turmoil over the summer, when their public statements about reining in their stimulus program pushed interest rates sharply higher and dented the housing recovery.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Carolyn Cui </div><div>767 words</div><div>25 November 2013</div><div>16:45</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasurys posted modest gains after two indicators pointed to a sputtering economy, easing some investors' fears that the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> will begin to cut back on its stimulus efforts as soon as next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 3 p.m. EST, the benchmark 10-year note added 4/32 in price, yielding 2.741% in a muted, preholiday trading. The 30-year bond climbed 4/32 in price to yield 3.833%. Bond prices rise when yields fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Fed</span> has said it will maintain its $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program until the economy has returned to sustainable growth and job creation. Monday's data suggested sagging growth relieved worries that the Fed would soon begin to taper such purchases, which have helped keep yields low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. pending home sales fell 0.6% in October to 102.1, the lowest level in nearly a year, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Economists had expected a 1.1% increase. The index has fallen for five months in a row due to higher housing prices and mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas</span> reported its headline manufacturing index fell to 1.9 in November from October's 3.6. It was the lowest reading since March, suggesting a continued slowdown in the region's manufacturing activity. Economists had anticipated an improvement to 5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everybody was just trying not to get themselves hurt between now and the end of the year, and they're trying to gather more clues about what the Fed (<span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>) might do with regard to tapering," said David Coard, head of fixed income sales and trading with the Williams Capital Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Monday's sale of $32 billion in two-year Treasury notes got an average reception from investors, with non-dealer bidders taking 49.8% of the total offer, compared with the average 49.5% from the past four auctions, according to CRT Capital LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors' interest in short-dated Treasury securities was in line with the recent steepening of the yield curve, where the yields on long-term Treasurys rose while those on short-term notes fell. Last week, the Treasury market reacted strongly to the minutes of the Fed's October policy meeting, which showed officials continued to look forward to ending the bond-buying program "in coming months," but signaled a strong commitment to keep short-term interest rates low far into the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the past week, the yield difference between two-year Treasury notes and 30-year bonds had reached the widest level in more than two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the two-year note auction drew slightly better-than-average bids from dealers and investors, at $3.54 in bids for every $1 worth of notes on sale, higher than the average $3.18 from the past four auctions. The new notes were sold at an interest rate of 0.300%, the highest rate offered by the Treasury since May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two-year auction will be followed by a $35 billion sale of five-year notes on Tuesday and a $29 billion auction in seven-year notes on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts at <span class="companylink">Barclays PLC</span> expect rates to drift higher in 2014 as the economic conditions in the U.S. continue to improve. The benchmark 10-year yields will rise to 3% by mid-2014 and 3.5% by the end of next year, <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> says. The movements of interest rates will be dominated by the pace at which the labor market improves and the trajectory of inflation gauges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the remainder of the year, <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> analysts expect interest rates to stay range bound. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s recent statements on financial conditions suggested that the central bank is comfortable with 10-year yields between 2.5% and 3%. The market is waiting for the next payrolls report, which will be released in early December, followed by the Fed's next policy-board meeting on Dec. 17-18. But many investors expect the Fed not to start tapering at the December meeting, as it is in the midst of the holiday season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The lack of liquidity will exacerbate any moves at year end and the Fed will want to avoid that," said Ajay Rajadhyaksha, co-head of fixed-income, currencies and commodities research at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> in New York. "Basically, investors believe nothing will happen until at least January, and probably March. So what's the incentive for bond markets to move one way or the other right now?"</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos   </div><div>636 words</div><div>25 November 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the nation's hottest housing markets over the past year are cooling off as buyers balk at paying higher prices while faced with rising mortgage rates, according to a Wall Street Journal survey of market conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a number of cities across California, Arizona and Nevada -- where price gains have been especially strong in the past year -- sales are slowing and supply is rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents and economists attribute the current slowdown to rising prices and a jump in mortgage rates, which have made homes less affordable for prospective buyers and a less compelling deal for the investors that have played significant roles buying up cheap foreclosures and other distressed homes over the past two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the July-to-September quarter, home values in Orange County rose just 1%; in San Diego, 2%; and in San Francisco, 3%. Those were the smallest increases in those markets since prices began to rise in early 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates, meanwhile, have increased around one percentage point since May, raising the monthly mortgage payment on a $400,000 house, for example, by about $230 to $2,025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's been a great deal of sticker shock," said John Wheaton, vice president of mortgage lending at <span class="companylink">Guaranteed Rate</span> in Costa Mesa, Calif. In Southern California, Mr. Wheaton said, "we're seeing more price reductions than we are price increases."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising inventory has been a relief for buyers like Tanya Pierson, who with her husband, Brian, closed this past Tuesday on a $275,000 five-bedroom home in Las Vegas that hit the market at $330,000 in September. "Some of these people are asking way more than the houses are worth," Ms. Pierson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bryan Lebo, the real-estate agent who represented the Piersons, says one open question for the broader housing recovery is whether demand rebounds next spring during the prime selling season. Prices could still rise, he said, though at a slower pace if more homes aren't made available for sale. But for now, he said, "there's no question -- the market is softening."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, many markets continue to be robust and sellers remain in control in many areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price gains have emboldened sellers like Karen Allan and her husband, Scott. They live in Las Vegas, where prices fell by nearly two-thirds from their 2006 peak. "We thought we were going to die in this house," said Ms. Allan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when they sold the three-bedroom home for $400,000 in September -- a figure that was down $25,000 from their asking price but still a 39% increase from what they paid to buy it in 2001 -- she and her husband "were high-fiving," she said. "We said to each other, 'Yes! We're out of here.' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Allans who are now renting a house and planning to buy something by next spring may have sold at the right time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With home prices and mortgage rates rising, competition for homes has eased and supply has ticked up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the recent gains in inventory could be proof that some of the hardest-hit markets are stabilizing. A big driver of the sales declines has been sustained drops in the volumes of foreclosed properties being sold, even as sales of nondistressed properties climb. These markets, which had favored sellers in the past year, are swinging back in favor of buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 28 major metro areas tracked in the latest Journal survey, nearly half saw inventories rise on an annual basis in September. That represents the highest share of markets showing a rise in supply in nearly three years, with notable increases in San Francisco, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Atlanta and Sacramento.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising Interest May Crash the House Party</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When cash is trash, the housing market is happy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the case during the mid-2000s boom when lenders required little or no money down. It is also true today, but for different reasons: Not only has central-bank stimulus kept mortgage rates artificially low, it has pushed record numbers of financial investors to buy into housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, interest rates have risen since talk began in May that the Federal Reserve could "taper" its bond-buying activity. Combined with rising prices -- they are up about 12% year over year on average nationwide -- it has helped push a measure of housing affordability developed by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> to a five-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher rates usually hit home sales with a lag, making data on pending home sales from the NAR -- the next reading is due Monday -- a key tool in gauging buying momentum. With the proportion of homes being sold for cash rising, it is now a more reliable housing barometer than weekly data on mortgage applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report this summer by <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> estimated 57% of residential-home sales through 2012 and early 2013 were paid for in cash compared with 19% in 2005. That is despite the fact the average 30-year mortgage rate so far this year is nearly two percentage points lower than back then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interestingly, the surge in cash buying hasn't blunted a steep drop in pending sales. They fell in September for a fourth consecutive month to the lowest level since last December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash buyers may be nearly as sensitive to interest rates as those requiring mortgages. While institutional investors buying multiple homes don't take out traditional home loans, they rely on cheap credit at a corporate level. Even cash-rich mom-and-pop investors in homes will redirect their savings if yields on bonds climb. Finally, traditional cash buyers such as retirees downsizing to smaller homes may have a tougher time selling their existing ones due to the spike in mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR sees home sales next year staying at about this year's level while mortgage rates end 2014 about a percentage point higher than today and two points higher than this past spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on recent trends, it may have to trash that forecast.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nancy Keates   </div><div>1280 words</div><div>22 November 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You want the house? You have to take Fiffi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is what the seller told my parents when they were negotiating to buy what became my childhood home, a 1920s-era stone Colonial in Philadelphia. Fiffi was a Norwegian elkhound with a weight problem and a certain sadness. The seller, recently divorced, was moving to an apartment building that didn't allow dogs. My parents agreed, and Fiffi became part of our family until she died a decade later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was in 1972, but the practice of tying unusual demands to home sales is still around. In fact, it is more prevalent than ever, real-estate agents and attorneys say. Inserted into sales contracts, these contingencies by both sellers and buyers are called irregular exclusions or inclusions. Whatever they are called, they are a source of headaches, particularly for real-estate agents whose commissions are dependent on closing the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate veterans say the increase has been gradual but continual. Steven D. Sladkus, a real estate attorney in New York, estimates the general nitpickiness is up about 25% over five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sometimes I can't help but laugh as an observer," says Mr. Sladkus, who this year handled a case in which the buyer of an $8 million Manhattan condo refused to sign the contract unless one of the owner's paintings -- attractive but not notable -- was included in the sale. The owners refused, even though they needed to move quickly, since they were being transferred overseas for work. The deal died.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving the most recent surge is a stronger housing market, which puts sellers in a better position to be extremely fussy. Since 2011, median home prices rose by 18% and existing home sales increased in volume by 20%, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Yet buyers are still in a strong-enough position to assert themselves, particularly since June's interest-rate increases diminished the buying frenzy of last spring. "Everyone has become a lot more discriminating," says Ellen Haberle, real-estate economist at national brokerage company Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in this era when a wider swath of homeowners customize their homes to a greater degree -- hiring architects and designers, choosing their own finishes and materials and fixtures -- more are likely to tie their identity to their homes. That, in turn, makes them more likely to be adamant about what stays and what goes, says Stephen Clowney, a professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Chicago, real-estate attorney Samuel Tamkin remembers a $900,000 house that went up for sale two years ago. The listing boasted of beautiful gardens, but at the bottom of the listing page it also spelled out that all shrubs and plantings were excluded from the sale. After the house sold, the seller showed up in a U-Haul and carted away hundreds of plantings, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connie Hinsdale, the managing broker at NW Oregon Realty Group in Silverton, Ore., had a deal a few years ago where the sellers insisted the sale include their three llamas. Luckily they found a thrilled buyer, says Ms. Hinsdale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, the agent has to take unusual steps to seal the deal. Earlier this year Robyn Jackson, a real-estate agent in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., found herself in the middle of a dispute over a "spitting turtle." Her buyer noticed during a final walk-through of a $500,000 home that the stone turtle -- which was hooked up to a hose and spit water into the swimming pool -- was missing. The buyer refused to close until Ms. Jackson agreed to write an addendum to the contract that it would be replaced. The seller, however, refused to give the turtle back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Jackson unearthed a similar turtle online and paid for it herself (cost: about $100). Although it was smaller than the original, the deal went through because the contractual requirement was met.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, Redfin real-estate agent Trevor Smith represented clients who were embroiled in a bidding war over three-bedroom, 1 1/2-bathroom home in Seattle. Mr. Smith found out what it would take to win: The owners were moving and wouldn't be able to take their four beloved chickens, named after four presidential first ladies, with them. So Mr. Smith sealed the deal by submitting an offer for $531,000 -- plus the adoption of Jackie O', Martha, Lady Bird and Abigail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was one other problem: The buyers didn't want the chickens. So Mr. Smith ended up taking the chickens himself his wife had wanted some. Plus, he was still haunted by the memory of a $1 million ranch deal that nearly died because the buyers balked at a requirement to care for an existing barn cat. (They eventually relented.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under real-estate law, a home sale includes fixtures that are permanently attached, such as the garage, ceiling fans and doors. Personal property, like beds and clothing, aren't included. That leaves many things that are more open to interpretation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pool tables, swing sets and hot tubs, for example, frequently get caught up in battles, real-estate agents say, particularly as they are expensive to remove. Often it is the real-estate agent who ends up having to hire a handyman to get it out of the yard, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harvey S. Jacobs, a real-estate lawyer in Rockville, Md., says his most unusual discussion over real estate inclusions involved a home that a woman believed was haunted. She asked him if she could write into the contract that the buyers had to keep certain pieces of furniture in place because that was where the ghosts lived. Mr. Jacobs told her she could write that in, though he didn't know how she would enforce it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, Jeff Stockwell was ready to sell a 32-acre lot next to his weekend home in Roxbury, Conn., a deal that had been in the works for a few months, when he found out that the buyer wanted to ride ATVs with his sons on the property. When Mr. Stockwell insisted on a deed restriction of no ATV use on part of the property, the buyer withdrew his offer. The land is on the market again now for $825,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stockwell has no regrets: "I'd probably be hearing a buzz right now," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In my family's case, agreeing to take Fiffi was a big commitment. Neither of my parents had ever had a dog. Lucky for them, Fiffi had her act together. On her first night she had to bark and bark until anyone realized she needed to go outside. "Fiffi trained us," says my mom.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How to Sweat the Small Stuff</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tips to keep contingencies from derailing your contract</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Sellers should write what they want to include and exclude specifically into the real-estate contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Buyers should ask the agent what is included and excluded before they submit an offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Even when it isn't required, offering to adopt a dog or a chicken can make a buyer's offer more attractive in a bidding war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- If a seller leaves something that's hard to move, don't try to get a court to order the seller to move it. Instead, pay to move the item and take the seller to small-claims court for reimbursement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Buyers and sellers should avoid meeting, if possible, since issues can arise that could hinder a transaction.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>797 words</div><div>21 November 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The White House dealt a setback to a prominent investor's bid to recapitalize <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, saying that a restructuring alone wouldn't put the $10 trillion U.S. home-loan market on sounder footing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene Sperling, President Barack Obama's top economic adviser, said the administration views a sale or recapitalization of the mortgage companies as a nonstarter because it wouldn't address their central role in mortgage finance. Mr. Sperling's remarks follow a proposal last week by investor Bruce Berkowitz of Fairholme Capital Management LLC to restore value to the companies' shares. Mr. Sperling didn't address the Fairholme proposal specifically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fairholme views its proposal as a starting bid with negotiable terms, including possible limits on the market share of the new companies, a person familiar with the firm said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government bailed out the companies in September 2008, staving off an outright collapse in the U.S. housing market but imposing terms that led to a plunge in the value of the firms' common and preferred shares. The futures of Fannie, Freddie and the U.S. housing market have been a subject of continual debate in Washington since the companies, facing tens of billions of dollars of losses on mortgage defaults in the housing bust, were placed under government control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I want to make clear our administration believes the risks are simply too great that this would re-create the problems of the past," said Mr. Sperling, director of the White House's National Economic Council, at a conference in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie and Freddie don't make loans. Instead, they buy them from lenders and package them into securities that are then sold to investors with guarantees to make investors whole if the underlying loans default. That has created deep, liquid markets for mortgages, particularly the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage that isn't widely available in other countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saving the companies at the height of the financial crisis required taxpayer infusions that ultimately totaled $188 billion. But with the U.S. housing market rebounding and the economy gradually expanding amid low interest rates and growing employment, Fannie and Freddie have become very profitable over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They will send $39 billion to the U.S. as a dividend payment next month, and by early next year they are likely to have repaid more in dividends to the government than the amounts the U.S. injected into the firms over the past four years. The <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> has warrants to acquire nearly 80% of the common stock of both companies; it hasn't exercised them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fairholme last week made a proposal to recapitalize the companies using the preferred shares of both. Two days later, last Friday, William Ackman's <span class="companylink">Pershing Square Capital Management LP</span> disclosed nearly 10% stakes in the common shares of both companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pershing wasn't available for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moves set off the latest surge in the companies' shares, which aren't listed by any major U.S. exchange following a 2010 delisting. On Wednesday, shares of Fannie rose 23 cents, or 8.9%, to $2.76, and Freddie rose 18 cents, or 7.7%, to $2.52. The companies' shares have mostly traded below $2 since the government takeover in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sperling said the administration isn't willing to entertain proposals to recapitalize parts of the companies and sell them back to investors because it wants to rebuild a stronger mortgage market not dominated by two large institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if restructured, Fannie and Freddie would retain significant advantages over any new entrants, Mr. Sperling said, because they have relationships with hundreds of lenders and economies of scale that could confer funding advantages, among other benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"New entrants to the market would have a sensible reason to fear that they would find competing against this structural advantage to be prohibitively costly," Mr. Sperling said. "All of us should fear that we could re-create a duopoly that the market would perceive as too-big-to-fail market entities."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration and top Republicans and Democrats haven't shown any support for a recapitalization or sale of the companies, but a consensus has been building that supports allowing new mortgage-bond guarantors to purchase government insurance for loans that are sold to investors. It isn't clear exactly how those firms would be capitalized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sperling said he was optimistic that bipartisan discussions between the Democratic and Republican heads of the Senate Banking Committee would create an opening for the government to address the futures of Fannie and Freddie.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office developers in the U.K. think they have hit on the next big thing: apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soaring prices for residential properties in London are prompting companies including <span class="companylink">Land Securities PLC</span>, <span class="companylink">British Land Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">Canary Wharf Group PLC</span> to shift gears and build condominiums instead of office towers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As recently as about three years ago, <span class="companylink">Land Securities</span>—the U.K.'s largest commercial-property developer—built apartments primarily to help it get government approval for office projects. Now the company plans to complete two London projects with 250 units by 2016, one of which is under construction. <span class="companylink">Land Securities</span> has another London development with 200 units that is in the planning stage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developer Canary Wharf is moving ahead with the first apartment in the original skyscraper-studded office district, which has seen residential development only on its fringes. <span class="companylink">Canary Wharf Group</span>, majority owned by <span class="companylink">Songbird Estates</span>, is planning to break ground next year on the 59-story Newfoundland tower and has switched the focus on Wood Wharf, a 20-acre site next to the district, to apartments from offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2011, major U.K. developers have built about a dozen projects a year in London that are either entirely or partially residential, according to construction-market data provider Barbour ABI. From 2004 to 2010, the average was six, the data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential developments have been "highly profitable," said <span class="companylink">Land Securities</span> Chief Executive Rob Noel. "It's part of the strategy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The turn in focus is being driven by a rebound in the U.K. housing market. House prices in August were the highest since official government records began in 1969. In September, they fell back slightly, although they were still 3.8% higher than the same time last year, the <span class="companylink">Office for National Statistics</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">London's office market has been recovering, but more slowly partly due to contraction in the financial-services sector. The city had 16.9 million square feet of space available in the third quarter of this year, compared with 15 million in 2010, according to <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>. Leasing activity increased 4% in the third quarter, but asking rents declined 2.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In London, values of townhouses and condominiums are especially high due partly to international buyers looking for assets that will hold their value in a low interest-rate environment. International buyers made up 49% of sales in prime central London in the year to June, according to data from property firm Knight Frank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers and investors in other major cities around the world also are seeing more profits in residential space than office space as downtowns become more popular to live and invest, while businesses remain tentative about expanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take, for example, the $1.1 billion purchase earlier this year of the Sony Building, an office building in the heart of New York's Midtown business district. Developer Joseph Chetrit, an active investor who also owns a stake in Chicago's Willis Tower, plans to convert a portion of the Sony Building to residential use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.K., big office developers used to balk at building residential space for fear that investors would punish their share prices, says Mike Prew, head of real-estate research at <span class="companylink">Jefferies International Ltd</span>. Now companies are able to pursue residential strategies without this happening, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stock investors have rewarded companies readying big residential projects. For example, shares of Capital &amp; Counties PLC are trading at close to double the value of the company's assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason: The company is planning to build about 3,000 units on the west edge of Chelsea, one of London's hottest markets. "People are excited that those expensive Chelsea prices will be dragged into this new area they're creating," says David Prescott, an analyst with Green Street Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the new focus on residential has raised concerns among some analysts. A recent report by Green Street said investors need to recognize that the strong demand that has boosted condo prices in London could cool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts at Green Street noted that a change in government policy—such as a possible tax on foreign capital gains that is being considered by the U.K.'s coalition government—might temper enthusiasm among foreign investors to buy condos. Domestic demand also may lag because London apartments are reaching such high prices that many workers in the city can't afford them, Green Street said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While values are up throughout the U.K., the change in focus among developers is particularly pronounced in London. Luxury London property prices, which fell 15.4% during the downturn, are now at record levels, 7.9% above their precrash highs, according to a Green Street index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Land Securities</span> is focusing all of its residential building efforts in the Victoria neighborhood, just down the street from Buckingham Palace. It expects to make a 20% profit on its next three planned projects, a spokesperson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developer Heron International has leased only two-thirds of its Heron Tower office project that was completed in 2011. But its 285-unit condominium development, which is being finished nearby, is over 93% presold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications The London office market had 15 million square feet of available space in 2010, according to <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that there were 5 million square feet of available space that year. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strong quarter from <span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>. shows that Americans continue to plow money into their houses, even as spending elsewhere has been lackluster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-improvement retailer on Tuesday said its profit for the three months ended Nov. 3 jumped 43% to $1.35 billion, as shoppers made more visits to its stores and spent more on average per trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales at <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> rose 7.4% to $19.5 billion, and the company again raised growth forecasts for its current fiscal year, which ends in early February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending broadly has been slack as the U.S. economic growth remains sluggish, but stores selling home improvement products have been a rare bright spot in the retail sector. <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> and rival <span class="companylink">Lowe's Cos</span>. continue to be beneficiaries of a housing recovery that began in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising housing prices and improvements in home construction and new home sales have led some homeowners to open their wallets for remodeling projects or big-ticket items like large home appliances, even as some are scrimping on apparel and other discretionary items.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the pace of mortgage applications and sales of newly built homes has slowed in recent months following a rise in long-term mortgage rates, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> executives said they are still bullish about the retailer's prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"New home construction is less important as a driver of our business than what's happening with existing homes, both turnover and most importantly, price appreciation," Chief Executive Frank Blake said on a conference call with analysts. He said people tend to feel better about fixing up their homes and investing in them when they expect to see price appreciation, and that is expected to continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome noted that home prices have risen about 10% from a year ago but remain 25% below their peak. "We think there's a lot of room for recovery," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> customers on average spent $56.27 per shopping trip in the recent quarter, up 3.2% from a year ago. The number of customer transactions rose 4%. Executives said recurring purchases of items such as cleaning products and light bulbs are helping to keep customers coming to stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the quarter ended Nov. 3, Atlanta-based <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> reported its same-store sales rose 7.4%. In the U.S. the increase was 8.2%. The year-ago period had benefitted from higher sales before and after Superstorm Sandy, which led people to stock up on batteries and flashlights.</p>

</div><div class="author">Alessia Pirolo </div><div>792 words</div><div>19 November 2013</div><div>17:54</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the heart of Berlin's central borough of Mitte, a German developer is transforming seven landmark buildings reflecting over three centuries of architectural history into a mixed-use complex, making it one of the largest private developments in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The properties include the 1791 home of a masonic lodge and a 1920s office building that housed the German Democratic Republic's Institute of Posts and Telecommunications. They will be turned into 150,000 square yards of apartments, offices, stores, a hotel and an outdoor market. Development company Freiberger Holding GmbH is investing €300 million ($405 million) in the project, called Forum Museumsinsel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project shows that developers across Europe are finding potentially profitable opportunities in turning historic properties into modern mixed-use buildings as the Continent slowly emerges from the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such developments can be tricky because they involve gaining approvals, technical problems working with ancient buildings and an overall scarcity of financing. But redeveloping historic property, if done right, can be more profitable than traditional real-estate developments, says David Tomback, development economics director at <span class="companylink">English Heritage</span>, a <span class="companylink">U.K. government</span> body assigned to preserve historic buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.K. between 1980 and 2011, historic projects generated total returns equal to or higher than those for commercial property overall, according to a 2011 study by Colliers International that was commissioned by <span class="companylink">English Heritage</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of recent projects are showing signs of success. In London, it took only three weeks last May to sell all of the 866 apartments that are being constructed as part of the Battersea Power Station project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1930s brick building on the River Thames is a cultural icon that has appeared in a Beatles video and on the cover of a Pink Floyd album. The building and its surrounding area are part of an £8 billion ($12.9 billion) redevelopment expected to be completed by 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Architects Rafael Viñoly, Norman Foster and Frank Gehry are working on that project. The developers hope to attract creative industries and startups with "interesting and funky offices," says Rob Tincknell, chief executive of Battersea Power Station Development Co., a Malaysian consortium of investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent rise in historic projects has encouraged some owners to put property on the block. Another of Mitte's historic assets, the Tacheles building, is on the market for about €200 million, says Alexander Kropf, an associate director at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> who is advising the owner, August Anno Jagdfeld.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dearth of recent developments, rising demand and a booming tech economy make this a "perfect time" to invest in Berlin commercial real estate, Mr. Kropf says. Originally a department store, the Tacheles building was used as offices of the SS during World War II.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But owning historic property can be troublesome. Tacheles was the focus of a protracted legal battle between its owners and the artists who had occupied the building since the fall of the Berlin Wall. One drawback of Berlin's booming real-estate market and rising rental prices is that its creative community increasingly is struggling to find spaces to work and live, says Barbara Fragogna, curator of the Kunsthaus Tacheles (Art House Tacheles), who left the building in September 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even more problematic for developers are the layers of bureaucracy they face when starting work on a landmark building. In Paris, <span class="companylink">LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton</span> is facing such issues with its €460 million conversion of the Belle Epoque department store La Samaritaine into a mixed-use complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such a development is "complicated" and "expensive," says Marie-Line Antonios, general director of La Samaritaine. But on the other hand, she adds, "it has lower risk: Because it is mixed-use, it provides a greater opportunity for a strong return."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Forum Museumsinsel project in Berlin also faced hurdles. It took more than a year for Freiberger Holding and the city government to reach an agreement on the use of a street that runs through the complex. The company's plans to develop an outdoor market are still under review by the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first phase of construction of the Forum Museumsinsel was launched in October and is expected to be completed by the end of 2014. Freiberger Holding hopes to secure permission from local authorities for a last phase by early next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developer already found some tenants. <span class="companylink">Deutsche Telekom</span> signed a lease to occupy a former university building that architect David Chipperfield is turning into an education center for the company. Companies from industries such as law, accounting and public relations are expected to occupy the other office spaces, says Klaus Kirchberger, CEO of Freiberger Holding.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">D.R. Horton's Foundation</span> Looks Solid</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America's housing market may be firmly in recovery mode, but "America's Builder," sure isn't acting like it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares in <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>. have trailed the S&amp;P 500 by 33 percentage points year to date. The gap between enthusiasm for the housing market and for home builders isn't hard to understand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the recovery in home sales and even in prices has been concentrated in the market for existing homes. That has benefited companies engaged in housing finance and home improvement more than those constructing new dwellings -- particularly suburban single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second negative point has been a spike in mortgage rates since April. That isn't an issue for the many cash buyers involved in buying multiple existing homes. Individual new-home buyers can afford a lot less home, though.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index of remodeling activity maintained by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> recently hit the highest level since 2004, while another index it maintains of pending home sales fell sharply over the summer from a three-year high. Tuesday's fiscal fourth-quarter results for <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> will show the initial impact of rising rates on profits and cancellations. Analysts expect it to earn 40 cents a share, against 30 cents in the same September-end period in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite interest-rate headwinds, the medium-term outlook for <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> is encouraging based on demographics and industry trends. For example, the value of its backlog rose by 56% year over year in June. At 10.7 times forward expected earnings, about half where it was a year ago, its recent underperformance has removed any froth from its valuation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While housing starts for single-family homes of the sort built by <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> are now back to levels last seen six years ago, they still are at just half their prehousing-bubble level on a population-adjusted basis. There were 421,000 new single-family homes sold in August on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis. That is way up from the 282,000 three years earlier, but just a third of the bubble-era level eight years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even a trend of rising rates and fairly pedestrian household formation should support moderate growth in home building in coming years. After taking a breather, it is time for home builders such as <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> to rejoin a slightly less exuberant housing recovery.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—Surging demand for U.K. homes led to the most widespread rise in house prices in more than 11 years during October, fueling fears that in the absence of a pickup in home building the nation may be on the brink of a fresh property bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors</span> Tuesday said its headline house prices balance rose to +57 in October, up from +53 in September, to hit its highest level since June 2002. The balance is calculated by subtracting the proportion of surveyors reporting house prices fell from those reporting that they rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reuters Prime Minister David Cameron, left, speaks to first time buyers Kayleigh Groom, right, and her partner Chris Day during a visit to Weston Favell in Northampton, central England.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without a significant increase in the construction of new homes, prices are set to rise further, RICS chief economist Simon Rubinsohn warned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The amount of homes currently up for sale is still nowhere near enough to keep up with demand and this imbalance urgently needs to be addressed. House-building starts have picked up recently but we are still well behind in terms of the amount of properties needed," Mr. Rubinsohn said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey is in line with other recent reports from lenders Halifax and Nationwide showing house prices rose again last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp jump comes as the government's new scheme to help more potential home-buyers secure a mortgage got under way. Under the second phase of its Help to Buy program, the government guarantees a proportion of a 95% loan-to-value mortgage—where the buyer has just a 5% down payment and can afford monthly mortgage repayments of nearly £1,000 ($1,601).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since starting four weeks ago, the response has been strong with 2,384 applications made through the <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland</span> and Halifax, which were the first two lenders to sign up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The majority of those applications came from first-time buyers in the South East of England for a home costing £163,000, the government said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the demand has prompted economists to warn of the need to monitor the housing market and take action if needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a mounting danger that house prices could really take off over the coming months," said Howard Archer, chief economist for the U.K. at IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is therefore of vital importance that policy makers closely monitor the situation and are prepared to act quickly and decisively if signs of the housing market overheating become increasingly widespread and pronounced," Mr. Archer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee says it stands ready to advise the Treasury if the property market shows signs of overheating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, FPC member Donald Kohn said that while the new supervisory body may not be able to stop bubbles forming, it should be able to prevent them from causing widespread harm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a bid to reassure critics that Help to Buy will be stopped if it threatens financial stability in the U.K., Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne has charged the FPC with reviewing the program annually. If the central bank is concerned it poses risks to house price inflation and recommends the scheme is ended then it would be "politically…very difficult" for the Treasury to ignore that advice, Mr. Osborne said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By AnnaMaria Andriotis   </div><div>901 words</div><div>8 November 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealthy borrowers no longer need large down payments to get a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More lenders are approving borrowers who put less than 20% down for million-dollar home purchases, suggesting banks are feeling sanguine about the luxury market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> lowered its minimum down-payment requirement to 15%, down from 20%, for loans of up to $1 million. <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> cut down-payment requirements by the same amount to a minimum of 15% in July for private jumbo mortgages, which start above $417,000 in most parts of the country and exceed $625,500 in pricier housing markets, such as New York and San Francisco. Also, in March, New Penn Financial, a mortgage lender based in Plymouth Meeting, Pa., and subsidiary of <span class="companylink">Shellpoint Partners</span>, began allowing 15% down payments for private jumbos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some banks haven't announced changes for private jumbo-loan down payments but will consider them. <span class="companylink">PNC Bank</span>, for instance, says it weighs accepting down payments below the 20% threshold on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the housing downturn, most lenders have required at least 20% down for private jumbo mortgages. A large down payment, according to lenders, made it less likely that borrowers would walk away from their home if prices plummeted and left them underwater on their mortgage. Mortgage applicants who wanted to make a down payment of less than 20% of the purchase price were often denied a loan. In some cases, their only option for approval was to pay mortgage insurance for at least the first few years of the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now lenders are lowering the bar, mostly for jumbo-mortgage approval. "You're finally starting to see some loosening of terms on the jumbo side," says Mike Fratantoni, vice president of research and economics at the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit unions have joined the trend. In August, North Carolina's State Employees' Credit Union, whose members are current and retired state employees and their families, lowered down payment requirements from 20% to 10% while increasing the maximum size of mortgages it will give out to $2 million per couple, up from $1.5 million. (Beyond North Carolina, the credit union originates mortgages for homes in Georgia, Tennessee, South Carolina and Virginia.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, some lenders have allowed small or no down payments for wealthy home buyers for a while. Divisions of large banks that cater to the wealthy, such as BNY Mellon Wealth Management and Citi Private Bank, provide 100% financing to clients while requiring a portion of their investment portfolio as collateral in lieu of a cash down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, the latest incentives from large banks don't require borrowers to have large sums of cash with that financial institution. And experts say it is likely that more banks will lower down payment requirements over the next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most lenders, for their part, say they are loosening this requirement because a significant risk has subsided: Rising home values suggest that fewer borrowers will foreclose or walk away from their homes since they are appreciating assets. Lenders foreclosed on roughly 3,000 homes valued at $1 million and over during the first eight months of the year, down 21.1% from the same period a year prior, according to Lender Processing Services, a mortgage-data tracking firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition among lenders is also more intense as higher interest rates make it harder to attract mortgage applicants. Since May, applications for refinancing have dropped roughly 58%, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>, and lenders have sought to lure in more home buyers by requiring less cash down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jumbo borrowers stand to benefit in several ways. They can compare more than just rates when they shop around for a mortgage. And they can get the keys to their home without locking as much cash into it: On a $2 million home, borrowers would need to put down $400,000 with a lender who requires 20% down. That would drop to $300,000 with a 15% down payment, and the borrower would be able to put the $100,000 saved to work elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cases, there are also fewer costs. Borrowers often have to pay a fee called mortgage insurance when they make a down payment that is below 20%, but most lenders who lowered cash-down requirements on jumbos have waived those costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are a few more points to consider:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Not in all states: Lower down payment requirements may not apply for homes in all states, depending on the lender. One credit union, for example, says it is sticking to its original down-payment standards in Florida and Nevada because many housing markets in those states are still unstable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Consider the market: Buyers in housing markets that still seem shaky may want to consider putting more down than what is required. Otherwise, if home values drop, they could end up underwater and have a difficult time selling or refinancing. Another option, of course, would be to hold off buying until home prices stabilize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Tight credit underwriting: Borrowers for the most part will still need a high credit score as well as income and asset documentation to qualify for a mortgage.</p>

</div><div class="author">David George-Cosh   </div><div>288 words</div><div>7 November 2013</div><div>06:19</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TORONTO—Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said he doesn't see "bubble-like indicators" affecting the country's housing market, but acknowledged it remained a key pressure in the marketplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flaherty said the government continues to monitor Canada's housing market, notably condominiums in large Canadian cities, but that conditions were "so far...okay." He said the government wouldn't be intervening in the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have to be careful that we don't get an artificial increase in prices, a bubble, because of speculation," Mr. Flaherty said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flaherty was speaking in Toronto after a round table discussion with business representatives ahead of the upcoming fiscal budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, <span class="companylink">Canada's government</span> tightened mortgage regulations for the fourth time in as many years in an effort to cool down an overheating housing market brought on largely by ultra-low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked to comment on the policy rate cut by the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> early morning, Mr. Flaherty said the period of ultra-low interest rates was "an anomoly" and that people should anticipate rates to eventually go up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flaherty said Canada's gross domestic product was growing at an annual pace of 1.8% to 2.0% this year, and that nominal GDP remained "weak." He reiterated that the Canada government remains on track to balance its budget by the fiscal 2015 year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The minister is expected to release a fall economic update later this month, at which time the government will update its fiscal forecast. A specific date for the fall update hasn't yet been unveiled. </p>

</div><div>472 words</div><div>6 November 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google Inc</span>. Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said the company plans to tap into Hong Kong's "natively entrepreneurial" culture and help incubate startups in partnership with a local university.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong -- which is home to a number of multibillion-dollar property-led conglomerates founded by immigrants from mainland China -- has "excellent connectivity [and is] an excellent place to do business," Mr. Schmidt said in a speech Monday at the campus of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Though few details about the partnership are yet public, the company said it would work with the school to offer mentorship to young entrepreneurs and sponsor trips to <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a myth that entrepreneurs work by themselves," Mr. Schmidt said. "In fact, they are members of an ecosystem of people who help them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Hong Kong's startup ecosystem is still limited, practitioners say it is growing. Despite high property prices in the financial hub -- which is home to one of the world's highest wealth gaps -- cheaper co-working spaces have proliferated, as well as other events to connect entrepreneurs. Opened two years ago, HK Commons, for example, is a co-working space that has more than 60 companies operating out of its 30,000 square feet of space. Demand is high: HK Commons founder Jong Lee said the wait list to get in is as long as two to three months, and he hopes to triple his available space in the coming year. And while property prices may be high in Hong Kong, he said, labor costs in the city are far cheaper than in, say, San Francisco. A good programmer, he said, costs a quarter of what it might in the U.S. While Mr. Schmidt was lavish in his praise of Hong Kong's entrepreneurial culture, Mr. Lee said that for too long, that spirit has actually been neglected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In Hong Kong, it was way too easy for too long to make money the old-fashioned easy way on real estate speculation," said Mr. Lee, whose startups include a tailoring shop and a U.S. steak delivery website. "If you're a family office and you can shoot fish in a barrel, why wouldn't you?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Lee said those times are ending. Since 2008, residential and commercial property prices in Hong Kong have soared, but with the administration having imposed strict cooling measures in the past year, analysts expect the market to take a tumble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At the same time, big financial institutions have drastically reduced their hiring," he said. "People are going to have to reassess their thinking."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Google spokeswoman Betty Wong said that the CUHK partnership should "hopefully begin" in the coming months.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson   </div><div>730 words</div><div>6 November 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As if there isn't enough to fret about in the new-home market, home builders have provided investors with another concern: the potential for declining profit margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roughly halfway through earnings season for home builders, margins have become the new focal point of investor angst. The concern is that builders' profit margins might start to dwindle as early as next year if, as many expect, price appreciation for new homes loses more momentum than the rising cost of building homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such jitters can reverberate for investors because the home-building industry is quite cyclical. Investors constantly scan for the latest sign that the market is gaining steam, plateauing or starting to decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If builders say the trajectory of margins is beginning to peak, then in a cyclical business, people tend to go from thinking the best to thinking the worst," said Stephen Kim, an analyst who tracks home-builder stocks for <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one is predicting that the housing cycle will turn negative this early. Still, investors are nervous that this might be a sign that the home-building industry's recovery will be more rocky or drawn out than initially expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-builder stocks already have fared relatively poorly in recent months amid a slowdown in sales of new homes. The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> U.S. Home Construction Index of home-builder stocks closed Thursday 21% below its 2013 high, set May 14.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The margin concerns surfaced during builder <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>.'s third-quarter conference call with investors Oct. 23. Meritage Chairman and Chief Executive Steven Hilton said the builder's gross margin rose to 22.8% in the third quarter from 18.6% a year earlier. What drew attention was his next statement, that Meritage's margins likely would rise or stay flat for two or three quarters before starting to decline next year toward 20% or 21%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The biggest impact for us, our margins, going forward is going to be land cost," Mr. Hilton said on the call. "Particularly in the California, it's going to be difficult for us to replace (at economical prices) some of that land that we got at really good prices" in past years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the many tricky things about land for builders is that they buy land two to three years before they start selling completed homes on it. Land prices were fairly cheap in 2011 before they started rising in 2012 and then spiking in 2013. That means that homes sold today are on land bought for relatively affordable prices in 2011 or thereabouts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, homes sold in 2014 and 2015 will be built on land bought at significantly higher prices last year and this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Journal reported, land-price gains recently began to slow. But smaller price increases still are increases. If home-price appreciation doesn't outpace that rise in costs, you get a margin squeeze. And that, at some point, leads to a selloff of the industry's stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Dugas, chairman, president and CEO of PulteGroup Inc., said during the builder's Oct. 24 call with investors that rising land prices will have a "push-down effect" on margins within an unspecified time frame. Pulte logged a third-quarter gross margin of 20.9%, up from 17% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another national builder, <span class="companylink">Ryland Group Inc</span>., reported a third-quarter gross margin of 20.6%, up from 19.1% a year earlier. Ryland President and CEO Larry Nicholson said Tuesday on the builder's call with investors that its margins will increase in the fourth quarter. But he didn't give a definitive outlook for Ryland's margins next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Margins are approaching the 21% to 22% range, and we've always said that we thought normalized margins were around 22%," he said. "So there's not a lot of room for it to grow. But for now, we see improvement out over the headlights."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does this mean for home-builder stocks? Well, stocks typically are valued in relation to earnings. "People might have overly aggressive earnings assumptions" in light of the potential margin squeeze, said David Goldberg, an analyst who tracks home-builder stocks for <span class="companylink">UBS</span>. "Therein lies the problem."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign buyers are willing to pay top dollar for second homes abroad, but the location needs to be a safe bet, according to a coming report on foreign ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 47% of prime home buyers are drawn to locations they view as solid investments, according to a report by Knight Frank, a global property consultancy based in London. To buyers, locations such as London and New York are protected from economic and political risk, plus offer potential for property appreciation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-end buyers seek out tried-and-true places because they are still reeling from the economic downturn five years ago, says James Price, head of international residential development at Knight Frank who worked on the report. "They want liquidity. They want the best places to invest and be secure," he says. "The reasons London and New York are very popular is they are two genuine safe havens."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers looking for trophy assets may be willing to try a more offbeat locale for lifestyle features, but that isn't a typical motivation, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Knight Frank's Global Development Insight report, set to be released Friday, looks at buyer requirements for prime, newly built residential properties. The report -- based on Knight Frank search data, sales data and survey responses from 54 individuals world-wide -- ranked the leading countries from which buyers originate, and the most common sales locations and prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Latin American buyers are big players in Miami, but they aren't ranked in Knight Frank's list, says Mr. Price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside of the safe havens, buyers tend to buy in their own regions, the report shows. Buyers in China are the most significant purchasers of prime new-build properties internationally, spurred by a strong yuan and slowing domestic economy, the report says. Although their interest extends to properties in New York and London, their primary interest remains regional, the report shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Russia, which ranked third on Knight Frank's list, buyers look abroad after exhausting local options. "They already have property portfolios in Russia -- a city home, a country home -- and then they're looking for another property abroad," says Elena Yurgeneva, director of residential at Knight Frank in Russia and the <span class="companylink">Commonwealth of Independent States</span>.</p>

</div><div class="author">Esther Fung   </div><div>758 words</div><div>1 November 2013</div><div>03:04</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI—New-home prices in China continued to climb in October, driven by strong demand in major cities, defying property controls and highlighting the challenges that policy makers face in keeping the market from racing ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in 100 cities were up 10.7% on average year-on-year in October, the highest growth rate since private data tracker <span class="companylink">China Real Estate</span> Index System began keeping records in June 2011. Prices rose 9.5% on year in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-on-month, prices accelerated for the fourth time in a row—up 1.2% from September, when they rose 1.1% from August, <span class="companylink">China Real Estate</span> Index System said on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The higher prices came despite curbs on multiple home purchases and higher down-payment requirements but they are unlikely to trigger any immediate government intervention, analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said Chinese President Xi Jinping's call this week for a boost in housing supply—while avoiding any mention of rising prices—suggests that further price controls are unlikely anytime soon and the government appears willing to tolerate higher prices. Mr. Xi was quoted by the official <span class="companylink">Xinhua News Agency</span> as making the remarks at a meeting with senior officials and property-market experts this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This shows that central-government officials are a little more in-tune with the market, trying to understand and steer the market rather than build a dam against housing demand," said James Macdonald, head of research at Savills China, a property consultancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The acceleration in home price growth isn't taking place across the country. Instead, it has been concentrated in major cities, where there is a shortage of supply, analysts and property developers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though land purchases by developers and construction starts have picked up nationwide recently, there is typically a nine-month lag before those translate into sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Xi said the government must focus on ensuring that needy people have adequate housing, while a tiered market should satisfy demand in the rest of the housing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"China must boost the housing supply at all costs and make the housing needs of the masses a priority," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government researchers and analysts also said that policy makers are focusing their efforts on long-term measures such as increasing the supply of smaller and more affordable private housing as well as a gradual expansion in the use of an annual tax on property. More affordable housing would take care of China's most vulnerable people at the bottom of the economic scale—a key political consideration. A property tax, if kept at a low rate and rolled out gradually, would send a signal to the market without choking off demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the <span class="companylink">China Real Estate</span> Index System survey, fewer cities showed an upturn in prices, with 75 cities registering higher month-on-month prices in October, compared with 79 in September. Prices in Changshu, a city in coastal Jiangsu province, grew the fastest, by 3.9% over the previous month. In Beijing, new home prices were 2.6% higher, moderating from September's 3.8% rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Plans by the local housing bureau in Beijing to ramp up supply of cheaper homes changed expectations in the local property market," said <span class="companylink">China Real Estate</span> Index System said. In Shanghai, prices rose 2.4%, up from September's 1.1% gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property developers welcome the more market-based approach in tackling rapid price gains, noting that the administrative measures, such as curbs on multiple-home ownership, would slam the brakes on market demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also maintain that market conditions in the bigger cities are different from those in smaller urban areas, and policies should reflect this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is no need for the central government to implement national curbs. Rather, the local governments should carry out their own property policies," said Zhang Yuliang, chairman of Shanghai-based developer <span class="companylink">Greenland Holding Group</span>, in an interview earlier this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another property survey that covers more cities in China also showed that the rise in new home prices is accelerating and that the gains are largely confined to major cities. Prices of new homes in 288 cities tracked by real-estate-services provider E-House China rose 0.8% in October from September after rising 0.4% in September from August. Prices climbed 10.5% in October from the same month a year earlier compared with a 10.4% rise in September.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Al Yoon   </div><div>502 words</div><div>1 November 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> is selling the first bond backed by rental income from single-family homes, highlighting the role of large investors in the U.S. housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond buyers are evaluating a $479 million offering of securities by <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s single-family home-rental business, Invitation Homes LP. The offering is expected to come to market next week, said an executive at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span>, which is arranging the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The offering is a test for the home-rental market, which has attracted rising interest since the financial crisis from institutional investors seeking to profit from a drop in U.S. home prices and rising monthly rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A successful sale could unlock a new channel for investors such as <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>, <span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span> and Colony Capital LP. The companies have spent billions of dollars in recent years buying homes and renting them out, helping to pave the way for a housing recovery that has boosted home sales and prices following an epic decline during the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're rooting for them," said Richard Saltzman, president of Colony Capital, at a conference sponsored by the New York University Schack Institute of Real Estate, speaking of the <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renting has become more popular since the 2008 financial meltdown, as some potential homeowners have been scared away by the sharp decline in U.S. house prices and others have had trouble meeting stricter requirements for obtaining mortgage loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan to sell the rental-backed securities underscores investors' desire for bonds that generate more income at a time when yields on government bonds are near historic lows and stocks are near record highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Invitation Homes deal is expected to yield more than typical mortgage-backed bonds, the lion's share of which are highly rated and backed by the government-supported mortgage companies <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal has been in the works for months, but is now larger than initially discussed. Securities issued by Invitation Homes carry ratings from the highest triple-A grade to "junk," or noninvestment grade, from Kroll Bond Ratings, according to a Kroll presale document.

</div><div class="author">Esther Fung   </div><div>532 words</div><div>31 October 2013</div><div>07:27</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI—Chinese property stocks climbed Thursday following remarks by President Xi Jinping calling for more housing and suggesting that further price controls are unlikely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Xi said the government must focus on ensuring that needy people have adequate housing, while the market should satisfy the rest of the housing system</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"China must boost the housing supply at all costs, and make the housing needs of the masses a priority," the official <span class="companylink">Xinhua News Agency</span> quoted Mr. Xi as saying late Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president's remarks didn't include any mention of home prices, which have been rising of late, raising speculation that the government might decide that new measures were needed to tame prices, on top of existing curbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said the president's remarks signal that the government was willing to tolerate higher prices at the top end of the market, provided there are more affordable homes for those with lower incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many industry experts and developers I have spoken with believe this means the central government will refrain from controlling the private housing market," said Jinsong Du, a <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> analyst. "This indeed sounds positive in the near term."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of developer <span class="companylink">China Vanke Co</span>. rose 1.4% to 9.21 yuan ($1.51) in Shenzhen, while <span class="companylink">Poly Real Estate Group Co</span>. shares climbed 1.8% to 9.51 yuan in Shanghai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central government has been tightening property-sector controls for nearly four years in hopes of reining in home prices. It has imposed limits on multiple home purchases and required higher down payments and mortgage rates. But this year it has taken a more accommodative stance amid concerns that sluggishness in the housing sector could derail the country's fragile economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In particular, there has been persistent growth in home prices in tier-one cities—Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou—which offer the best jobs and schools and so attract home buyers from the rest of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An affordable-housing program has had mixed results, despite repeated pledges to roll out cheaper homes for the neediest people. Local media have reported on widespread problems of shoddy quality and corruption that lets people with higher incomes buy homes meant for low-income families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Solving the housing needs of the masses is a long-term task," Mr. Xi said, adding that there is insufficient public housing and unfair allocation of these lower-cost homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His remarks were also seen as significant because they came ahead of a key meeting of senior <span class="companylink">Communist Party</span> officials that begins Nov. 9. China's leaders are expected to discuss a number of proposals for economic overhaul, among them allowing faster urbanization and adjusting the tax system, which could have an impact on the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comments could allude to potential changes in urbanization strategy and residence-permit, land and tax systems that could come out of that meeting, He Tian and Xu Lin, researchers at property brokerage and data provider <span class="companylink">SouFun Holdings</span>, wrote in a report.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson  </div><div>802 words</div><div>30 October 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown in sales of newly built homes since last summer has sapped momentum from the land market, as home builders are starting to balk at paying increasingly lofty prices for lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend stands to slow the rise of new-home prices, which have increased since 2011 and now are at 2008 levels, an average of more than $300,000 this year, according to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>. Land typically accounts for up to 40% of the cost to build a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the housing market began recovering in 2011, investors have been bidding up the price of finished lots, which are home pads outfitted with infrastructure such as utilities and sewer pipes and thus ready for construction. But with new-home sales and prices cooling, some builders are renegotiating land buys to get lower prices or even walking away from deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, lot prices have gone from a gain of nearly 7% in the first quarter of 2013 compared with the previous quarter, to gains of about 6% in the second quarter and 4% in the third quarter, according to a survey of land buyers and sellers in 55 U.S. markets conducted by housing-research and advisory firm Zelman &amp; Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Demand and prices had been increasing at unsustainable rates," says Larry Seay, chief financial officer of <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>., which sold 4,484 homes in the first nine months of 2013. "It is good for the industry to take a little breather, let the land market moderate and get to a more normal rate of growth and house-price appreciation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lot prices have been volatile since the downturn hit. In early 2009, prices for finished lots were about 55% to 60% lower than their 2006 peak, according to Zelman &amp; Associates estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lot prices began rebounding in late 2011 and posted their biggest gains since then in the first half of this year, fueled by robust demand for homes and a shortage of lots in most markets. In an extreme example, finished lots in the Sacramento suburb of Roseville, Calif., that sold for an average of $120,000 each in early 2012 had jumped to about $220,000 by this year's first half, according to land brokerage Land Advisors Organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The land-price increases went hand-in-hand with the rising prices of new homes. The average price of a new home in the U.S. reached an all-time high of $337,000 in April, census data show. During the housing crisis, the average dipped as low as $245,000 in January 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home market took a downward turn last summer, as buyers were spooked by double-digit percentage increases in new-home prices and a 1 percentage-point increase in interest rates between May and September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With demand for new homes weakening, builders began re-examining what they were willing to pay for land. Some buyers now are asking sellers for lower prices on land they already have committed to buy, a practice known as "retrading." Others are canceling deals before they are required to make nonrefundable deposits but after they have spent thousands of dollars assessing the land's potential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, land prices have lost some of their upward momentum, and in a few markets they are declining. In Roseville, lot prices have retreated by 20% to 25% since peaking early this year, according to Land Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are fewer bidders for the highest-priced land despite the quality of the location," says Reed Porter, president of builder <span class="companylink">Ryland Group Inc</span>.'s Arizona division. "There has been some retrading."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil Morris is among the sellers who were left at the altar. National builder <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. had been under contract for a year to buy from an investment group he represents a 50-acre parcel near Durham, N.C., where it planned to construct 250 town homes. The price: $17,000 per lot, totaling $4.25 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> walked away, telling Mr. Morris it had decided the development costs were too high to be covered by what <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> figured it could charge for the town homes, he recalled. A <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> representative declined to comment. "It's a little frustrating," Mr. Morris says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meritage, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., canceled two land purchases in the Phoenix area in August and September after it spent more than $10,000 to study building on each. The conclusion: The parcels' prices were too high absent larger gains in home prices. "We just didn't see the home-price appreciation in those markets," says Michael IlesCremieux, a regional vice president of land for Meritage.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Mitchell   </div><div>622 words</div><div>30 October 2013</div><div>09:37</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—U.S. consumer prices climbed modestly in September, underscoring weak inflation and supporting a likely decision by Federal Reserve officials to keep their bond-buying program intact later Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consumer-price index[http://www.bls.gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf], which measures what Americans pay for everything from bread to dental care, rose 0.2% from August, the Labor Department said Wednesday. Core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, increased 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a year ago, overall prices were up 1.2% while core prices were up 1.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report is particularly noteworthy because it's used to calculate annual cost-of-living increase in Social Security payments for almost 58 million Americans. The <span class="companylink">Social Security Administration</span> said Wednesday that benefits would increase 1.5% in January. The figure is based on how much certain prices rose from July through September compared with the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in overall prices in September reflected higher costs for energy, medical care and home rents. But the report indicates inflation remains below the Fed's annual target of 2%, reflecting a sluggish U.S. recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed officials are set to conclude a two-day policy meeting later Wednesday. They are expected to again delay reducing an $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program, which is designed to encourage consumer and business spending by pushing down interest rates but has some observers concerned about future inflationary pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The underlying message remains one of very subdued price pressures continuing to provide a very favorable backdrop for the Fed's accommodative monetary policy stance," <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> economist Millan Mulraine wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak inflation was a factor behind Fed officials' decision to keep the program intact at their September meeting. With unemployment high and no sign prices will take off soon, supporters of the bond-buying program say the Fed should continue focusing on boosting the economy. They point to new signs of slowing job growth and cooling home sales—after mortgage rates rose in the spring—as evidence it is too early to pull back on the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics say the program has had a muted effect on reducing unemployment, along with the risk of higher inflation at some point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report is the latest sign the sluggish recovery continues to hamper businesses' ability to raise prices for goods and services, a picture that isn't likely to change soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate Labor Department report Tuesday showed wholesale prices, a signal of where consumer prices might be headed, fell 0.1% in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Commerce Department's price index for personal consumption expenditures, also suggests inflation is weak. The latest PCE price index showed overall and core prices were 1.2% higher in August from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report showed that a rise in energy prices from August offset costs declines or flat prices for other items.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy costs rose a seasonally adjusted 0.8% in September. That reflects gasoline costs that, while falling on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, didn't fall as much as expected during this time of year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other energy costs, including prices for natural gas, also rose on a seasonally adjusted basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-vehicle prices rose 0.2%, medical care costs climbed 0.1% and prices for shelter, mainly rents, ticked up 0.2%. However, food costs were flat, and prices for apparel dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate Labor report Wednesday, Americans' real average weekly earnings fell 0.1% in September from the prior month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taping Up India's Broken House Quickly</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Easy money let emerging markets take it too easy in recent years. Now some are trying to patch things up quickly, before global liquidity starts to tighten.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Federal Reserve scared markets over the summer, when it suggested it would scale back bond purchases. Though the Fed isn't changing its bond-buying course for now, emerging-market policy makers who grew addicted to cheap foreign money don't want to take chances. Last week, Malaysia and Indonesia promised to trim subsidies and shore up public finances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now India's hard-pressed central bank is doing its part.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India was among the emerging economies hardest hit by the Fed's suggestion it would scale back. The country's current-account deficit widened to an unhealthy 4.9% of gross domestic product in the quarter ended in June, meaning it needed more foreign capital to finance the economy. Yet what foreigners got in exchange for investing in India was negative real interest rates and falling growth. With a hint U.S. rates might be more attractive than zero, foreigners turned tail, sending the rupee plunging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of India</span>'s new chief, Raghuram Rajan, raised the benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point Tuesday, after an identical increase last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increases restore confidence and show that Mr. Rajan is serious about taming consumer prices, which have persistently risen at an annual rate exceeding 8% for the past five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The RBI previously didn't respond strongly enough: In inflation-adjusted terms, short-term borrowing costs stayed below zero for most of the past five years and sent India's savings rate down to a five-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The telegenic Mr. Rajan has gotten markets comfortable with India, for now. The <span class="companylink">Bombay Stock Exchange</span>'s benchmark Sensex index climbed 1.7% Tuesday, bucking equities' typical response to rate increases. The Sensex is near its all-time high, while the rupee is up 10% since Mr. Rajan came on board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is important that investors not get ahead of themselves. Real change requires that New Delhi enact tough land and tax reforms, slash fuel subsidies and get spending under control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rally in India's stocks and currency also owes itself to short-term boosts. The Fed's decision to delay tapering off the bond buying is one. Another, as Mr. Rajan noted in the policy address, is the central bank's provision of dollars to India's oil importers, presumably by dipping into its foreign-exchange reserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India and other emerging markets are taking advantage of a reprieve to get their houses in order. If they keep this up, they might survive the next taper storm better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Abheek Bhattacharya</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed Is House Bound Amid Weak Pending Home Sales</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market is probably not in nearly as much trouble as Monday's dismal report on pending home sales suggested. But the Federal Reserve won't want to take any chances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said its index of pending home sales, which measures contract signings for previously owned homes, fell 5.6% in September from August. The drop put the index 1.2% below its September 2012 level, marking the first year-over-year decline since May 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, the rise in mortgage rates -- to 4.3% at the end of September from a low of 3.35% this spring -- that came amid expectations the Fed would reduce its bond purchases at its meeting last month did some damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at least some of the drop in pending home sales was probably payback for a flurry of contract signings that began in May, when the pending home-sales index jumped 5.8% from a month earlier. One big reason for the stepped up activity: Worries about rising rates prompted many potential buyers to get off the fence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, by July, 10% of respondents to the <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span>'s monthly survey of consumers who said it was a good time to buy a home cited borrowing ahead of higher interest rates as a reason. That was the largest share since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, as far as actual housing activity goes, September's big drop is less significant than meets the eye. September is a generally weak month for contract signings, while the spring and early summer are more active as prospective buyers look to move ahead of the new school year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors group adjusts the pending home-sales index for such swings, amplifying seasonally weak months and damping strong ones. Put otherwise, housing activity was even stronger in the spring and summer than the index suggests. The payback, in terms of actual lost pending sales, wasn't as severe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the same, it will be a while before it is clear September was more payback than the start of a real problem. Add it to the long list of reasons for the Fed to let more time pass before it puts tapering back on the table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Justin Lahart</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overheard</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span>'s guidance on interest rates, with a 7% unemployment threshold and three exceptions to it known as knockout clauses -- two based on the path of future inflation and one on whether monetary policy poses a risk to financial stability -- too complicated? No, says Spencer Dale, BOE chief economist and a member of the Monetary Policy Committee. Indeed, at an event Monday, he was able to show proudly that the essential tenets of forward guidance fit comfortably on a single slide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alas, he proceeded to explain that, under the forward-guidance policy, investors should pay particular attention to every speech from every one of the committee's nine members. Mr. Dale went on to say that if a member were to judge one of the inflation knockouts breached, he or she might vote to raise rates, or not, or simply declare themselves no longer bound by guidance. In that case, investors might need a spreadsheet to keep track.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Higher mortgage rates and rising home prices scared off prospective home buyers in September, sparking the fourth straight monthly drop in a key measure of home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>' gauge of pending sales of existing homes fell 5.6% last month from August, the trade group said Monday. That pushed the measure down to its lowest level since December 2012. It fell 1.2% year-to-year, marking the first time in more than two years that pending-home-sales activity was lower than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors group attributed the drop to the rising costs of purchasing a home, as well as budget battles in Congress that hit consumers' confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> had expected a 0.5% monthly rise. "This is worse than we expected and it surely lays to rest the notion that the housing market is strong enough to absorb the rise in mortgage rates with no ill-effects," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales are considered a timely gauge of the housing market because the report measures when a contract is signed but the transaction hasn't closed. The closing can be one to two months later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of contracts signed has been declining steadily since May. During that month, the sales figure shot up nearly 6% from the previous month as many fence-sitters rushed to buy homes and lock in lower mortgage rates just as rates started to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between April and August, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose by more than a full percentage point, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. It peaked at 4.58% in August, and hovered around those levels for much of September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have also been rising as more would-be buyers submit bids for homes. Economists expect the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price index for August, set for release Tuesday, will show a 12.5% gain in prices in August from a year earlier in 20 of the largest U.S. cities. All 20 cities have shown year-over-year gains for seven straight months. The Realtors group said last week that its measure of median home prices for September rose 11.7% from a year earlier, continuing a path of increases but at a slower pace than in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other economic news:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's industrial output returned to prerecession levels for the first time last month, though weak gains in manufacturing highlighted the sector's slow recovery. Industrial productiona measure of output at U.S. factories, utilities and mines -- increased a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in September from the prior month, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gain, driven largely by rebounding utility use, pushed overall output back to its 2007 average for the first time since the recession.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is probably not in as much trouble as Monday's dismal report on pending home sales suggested. But the Federal Reserve won't want to take any chances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said its index of pending home sales, which measures contract signings for previously owned homes, fell 5.6% in September from August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop put it 1.2% below its September 2012 level, marking the first year-over-year fall since May 2011. Clearly, the rise in mortgage rates -- to 4.3% at the end of September from a low of 3.35% this spring -- that came amid expectations the Fed would reduce its bond purchases at its meeting last month did some damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at least some of the decline in pending home sales was probably payback for a flurry of contract signings that began in May, when the index jumped 5.8% from a month earlier. One reason: Worry about rising rates prompted potential buyers to get off the fence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By July, 10% of respondents to the <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span>'s monthly survey of consumers who said it was a good time to buy a home cited borrowing ahead of higher interest rates as a reason. That was the largest share since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, as far as actual housing activity goes, September's big drop is less significant than meets the eye. September is generally weak for contract signings, while the spring and early summer are more active as prospective buyers look to move ahead of the new school year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors group adjusts the pending home-sales index for such swings, amplifying seasonally weak months and damping strong ones. Put otherwise, housing activity was even stronger in the spring and summer than the index suggests. The payback, in terms of actual lost pending sales, wasn't as severe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it will be a while before it is clear September was more payback than the start of a real problem. Add it to the long list of reasons for the Fed to let more time pass before it puts tapering back on the table.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Even as annual home-price growth in August hit the fastest pace in more than seven years, data released Tuesday morning show that monthly gains are slowing down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in August were up 12.8% from the year-earlier period, the fastest pace since early 2006, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home-price index. Of the 20 cities in the main index, 13 posted double-digit annual gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pent-up demand and limited inventory have been supporting home prices. Some of that pent-up demand was unleashed in August when buyers rushed to lock in low mortgage rates and home sales spiked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities that were hit particularly hard when the bubble burst have been posting outsized annual growth. In August, Las Vegas home prices were up 29% from the year-earlier period. Yet prices there remain 47% below the peak level. Meanwhile, prices are also jumping in areas with lots of competition for homes. In San Francisco, for example, home prices in August rose 25% from the year-earlier period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, monthly details of the Case-Shiller report show some softening. Home prices rose 1.3% in August, the smallest monthly gain since March, as 16 of the 20 cities saw slower growth. After seasonal adjustments, home prices in August rose 0.9%, below a recent peak of 1.9% in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Recent increases in mortgage rates and fewer mortgage applications are two factors in these shifts," said David Blitzer, index committee chairman at <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span><span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking forward, economists expect home-price growth to moderate, as rising mortgage rates curb some demand, cutting pressure on prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With existing home sales now clearly slowing quite sharply, we have to expect price gains to slow a good deal further over the next few months, but we don't expect to see any outright declines unless the inventory of homes for sale rises well above its current level," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price growth could also slow due to expanding inventories as more sellers become willing and able to place their homes on the market. The partial government shutdown that delayed some loan processing and shook consumer confidence could also slow price growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the blistering pace of annual growth, home prices in August were about 20% below a 2006 peak.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jonathan House   </div><div>805 words</div><div>29 October 2013</div><div>12:43</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—U.S. wholesale prices fell in September, a new sign that inflation remains in check as the Federal Reserve considers its easy-money policies in a two-day meeting set to conclude Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The producer-price index[http://www.bls.gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/ppi], which measures how much companies pay for everything from footwear to computers, fell 0.1% in September from August, the Labor Department said Tuesday. The decline was primarily the result of an 18% decline in fresh-vegetable prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding food and energy components, core wholesale prices rose 0.1%. Compared to the same period last year, September wholesale prices rose by 0.3%, the lowest annual level since October 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wholesale prices have been subdued since mid-2012, the result of slack demand in the U.S. and abroad. Weak global economies have helped put a damper on energy prices. U.S. agricultural prices have been soft after a mid-2012 spike caused by a drought last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Inflation is taking a very, very long nap," said Michael Montgomery, an economist at IHS Global Insight. "Almost nothing is causing significant upward pressure on prices," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest inflation reading comes as Fed officials gather Tuesday and Wednesday for their first policy meeting since deciding last month to leave unchanged their $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program to stimulate the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed is expected to leave its program unchanged Wednesday. Many economists now expect the central bank to maintain its current pace of bond purchases at least until late this year or early next year, due to weaker labor-market performance and volatile economic reports from the government shutdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Continued weak inflation will likely reinforce those expectations. On Wednesday, the Labor Department will publish September data on consumer prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low inflation gives the Fed more scope to pursue its easy-money policies. Continued efforts by the central bank to hold down interest rates could be good news for an economic recovery that remains stuck in low gear. Data from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> on Monday showed a sharp decline in September pending home sales, a new sign that higher mortgage rates and rising sale prices have dented the housing rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp decline in September fresh-vegetable prices came after they surged 27% in August. This category is highly volatile, conditioned by weather and crop conditions from month to month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy wholesale prices rose by 0.5% in September. Natural-gas and heating-oil prices rose, while gasoline fell slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for intermediate goods—articles like sugar and leather that require further processing—rose a modest 0.1% in September. Prices of raw materials, known as crude goods, rose by 0.5%. <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> economist Jimmy Coonan said that low price growth throughout the production chain signals that "inflation pressures should remain benign."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Labor Department is revamping its system for measuring wholesale prices, the latest overhaul by a U.S. statistical agency to capture a broader range of economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's current producer-price index had become outmoded as the U.S. economy increasingly shifted from manufacturing toward services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new measurement system aims to capture for the first time the prices companies pay for services and for construction. It will also measure for the first time the prices companies pay for goods and services that are destined for export or for government customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department's <span class="companylink">Bureau of Labor Statistics</span> estimates the new system will allow it to measure wholesale prices throughout 75% of the U.S. economy, up from 33% currently. It will also bring the government's producer price index closer in line with its consumer price index, which already measures the prices of many services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new index will replace the old one when the Labor Department publishes its report on January 2014 producer prices in February. Until then, it will continue publishing wholesale price data according to the old methodology, as well as data calculated according to the new methodology with a two-week delay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For August, the last month for which both sets of data are available, the official release showed wholesale prices rose 1.4% on a nonseasonally adjusted basis over the prior 12 months, while the data prepared according to the new methodology showed a 1.9% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, the Commerce Department's <span class="companylink">Bureau of Economic Analysis</span> took its own steps to expand the scope of its coverage by adding new measures and data for its report on gross domestic product. One of the biggest changes is how the agency now measures what it calls the "knowledge economy" through investments in research and development and entertainment and the arts.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Esther Fung </div><div>797 words</div><div>29 October 2013</div><div>06:15</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI—Shanghai-based developer Greenland Holdings Group plans to invest 1 billion Australian dollars (US$957 million) in real estate in Sydney and Melbourne in the next two years, as part of an aggressive global expansion [http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/deals/2013/03/19/chinas-greenland-group-plans-property-investments-in-u-s-australia/] that has already included billion-dollar projects in the U.S. this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Zhang Yuliang, chairman of the state-owned conglomerate, said the plan depends on whether the welcome mat remains out to investment as well as immigrants and foreign students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"How much we invest in Australia depends on the country's macroeconomic policies, how open it would be to foreign investment and trade," he told reporters Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If Australia closes its market, it would be detrimental to the economy," said Mr. Zhang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March Greenland spent A$480 million on a residential and hotel project in Sydney called Sydney Greenland Center. It also has an interest in a project near a horse-racing track in Melbourne.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there has been some backlash in Australia, with Chinese buyers blamed for pushing property prices out of reach of local residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Australian government is eager to strengthen business ties with China but faces calls from within the ruling coalition to more wary of foreign investment in industries such as agriculture. Prime Minister Tony Abbott, as a candidate campaigning ahead of September's federal election, said his Liberal-National coalition would increase regulatory scrutiny of sales of agricultural land and businesses to overseas buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, he also has said he has plans to secure a free-trade agreement with China, and he's proposed a low-tax zone in the remote Northern Territory to help attract investment and encourage farming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australia is home to a large number of international students and mainland Chinese [http://online.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/news/articles/SB10001424127887323466204578382673621513536], which helps buoy demand for Greenland's properties, Mr. Zhang said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For our Australia projects, perhaps 50% to 60% would be sold to the local Chinese population and foreign students," he said, adding that Greenland expects to sell half its Sydney project within a month of its launch in late November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenland is also keen on casino projects in Australia, Mr. Zhang said, adding that it is already developing a casino in South Korea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenland has spent billions of dollars this year alone acquiring large projects abroad, including a 70% stake in a 15-tower apartment project in Brooklyn, New York [http://online.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/news/articles/SB10001424052702304520704579127822887005590]. Greenland estimated the whole project with cost more than $5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenland is among the highest-profile mainland property companies to go on a shopping spree this year, but it is hardly alone: Rival <span class="companylink">China Vanke</span> has projects in San Francisco, Hong Kong and Singapore, while <span class="companylink">Dalian Wanda Group</span> is splashing out on a $1 billion luxury hotel in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Internationalization is a must for us, not just in the U.S., but also Europe, Australia and Asia," said Mr. Zhang, who defended the role of Chinese investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Chinese buyers are owner-occupiers and their purchases will benefit Australia's employment numbers and tax receipts," said Mr. Zhang. "It's prejudice to link Chinese buyers to speculation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenland's real-estate acquisitions abroad have been closely watched by distressed-property developers and foreign governments. The company notes that it is focusing on mature cities with a sizable Chinese population that also attracts Chinese tourists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, Mr. Zhang said Greenland has met with Australian Trade Minister Andrew Robb and London Mayor Boris Johnson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Mr. Robb suggested more open policies, which is welcome," said Mr. Zhang. Australian trade officials weren't available late Tuesday their time for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commenting on the company's recent investments in the U.S.—in addition to its tentative Brooklyn deal, in July Greenland bought a US$1 billion mixed-used project in Los Angeles—Mr. Zhang said that he didn't see U.S. projects as high-risk. Greenland will focus on opportunities in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, Mr. Zhang said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The economic recovery in the U.S. is relatively good and asset prices are reasonable," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite its global push, Greenland remains positive about the domestic property market overall, according to the Greenland chief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While bigger cities such as Shanghai and Beijing are having a hard time keeping prices in check, and need government measures to help, in second- and third-tier cities prices are rising only moderately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is no need for the central government to implement national curbs—rather, the local governments should carry out their own property policies," he added. "I still have confidence in China's housing market for the next five to 10 years."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European stocks drifted lower in quiet trading as disruptions following a storm that hit the U.K. overnight helped keep trading volumes low. Investors remained wary of making bold moves ahead of U.S. economic news expected this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index slipped 0.2% to 319.49. Germany's DAX edged down 0.1% to 8978.65 and France's CAC 40 fell 0.5% to 4251.61. But London's FTSE 100 edged up 0.1% to 6725.82.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., stocks closed little changed, but the S&amp;P 500 index reached another record high as investors took disappointing results from blue-chip drug maker Merck and mixed economic data in stride.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 1.35 points, or less than 0.1%, to 15568.93. The Dow erased gains of as much as 28.81 points in the final hour of trading. The S&amp;P 500 index gained 2.34 points, or 0.1%, to 1762.11, while the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> Composite gave up 3.23 points, or 0.1%, to 3940.13.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record high for a second straight session, and the sixth time in eight sessions. The Dow ended 0.7% shy of its Sept. 18 all-time high close of 15676.94.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The path of least resistance is higher," said Randy Billhardt, head of capital markets at investment bank <span class="companylink">MLV &amp; Co</span>. "The bad news is shrugged off, and the good news is being embraced."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dow component Merck dropped 2.6% after it reported adjusted third-quarter earnings above analysts' estimates but revenue that fell a bit shy. Sales of Januvia, a diabetes drug, declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, "earnings for the most part have been well received," Mr. Billhardt said. "The market as a whole has held onto some pretty significant gains for the year, which in itself is a pretty significant achievement."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With about half the S&amp;P 500 companies having reported results through Friday, 75% have beat earnings estimates while 52% have topped revenue forecasts, according to FactSet. The year-over-year earnings growth rate for the third quarter is 2.3%, FactSet said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trading in Europe was quiet. Some traders and investors were away from their desks because many of their children's schools were on holiday. Volumes were further dented by the storm that hit the U.K. overnight, causing travel cancellations and delays for commuters and keeping some traders at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot of European trading is conducted from London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. industrial production for September rose 0.6% from August, exceeding expectations of 0.4% growth. Meanwhile, pending home sales for September fell 5.6% to the lowest levels seen since December, missing expectations of a 0.5% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors were awaiting data on U.S. retail sales and inflation due Tuesday, the ADP employment report on Wednesday, and manufacturing figures Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">London-listed <span class="companylink">Aggreko</span>, the world's largest temporary-power supplier, surged 6% after the company said it expects full-year pretax profit to be in line with the market's expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Swedish lock maker <span class="companylink">Assa Abloy</span> gained 3.8% after announcing plans to launch a restructuring program in the fourth quarter, as it reported slightly higher-than-expected third-quarter revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro was fetching $1.3786 in late New York trading from $1.3807 late Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude for December delivery gained 83 cents a barrel, or 0.85%, to $98.68 on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>. Gold for October delivery slipped 40 cents a troy ounce to $1,352.00 on the Comex division of Nymex.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ORTLEY BEACH, N.J. -- John Anello had visited the Jersey Shore since he was a small child and always wanted a beach home there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Superstorm Sandy has granted his wish -- and made him part of a national demographic shift that has driven up real-estate prices, while sowing social discord, in some coastal communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Sandy, Mr. Anello says he paid $296,000 for a lot in Ortley Beach, where a small home was destroyed by the storm. He plans to build a 2,500-square-foot house on 8-foot pilings for about $350,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a time to buy," says the 52-year-old Mr. Anello, an automotive technician in West Orange, N.J., with his own business. "I guarantee that you'll see a lot of people moving in and rebuilding the whole area. My house will be worth double what it is worth now in five years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year after Sandy swept the coast, inflicting what New Jersey estimates at more than $38 billion in damage to the state, some shore towns are still grappling with closed streets, broken streetlights and unfinished boardwalks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state, known for its summer tradition of visitors streaming to its beaches, has hundreds of thousands of homes -- including at least 120,000 seasonal homes -- in areas slammed by Sandy, according to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In more-modest communities, Sandy has accelerated a trend that real-estate experts see in many waterfront communities elsewhere in the U.S.: The rising cost of housing, insurance and taxes has already turned many vacation spots into havens affordable mainly to the more affluent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a storm's damage, many less-wealthy longtime owners find the only financially viable option is to sell. That moves many such properties further up the economic ladder, as buyers like Mr. Anello build bigger, more luxurious homes where bungalows once stood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result has been a surprise in these coastal communities: Many have found that storms were ultimately followed by real-estate prices that rose, rather than fell as feared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Hurricane Andrew hit Florida in 1992, a <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> study showed values dramatically increased for the hardest-hit areas before eventually settling back to pre-storm rates of increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1988, a year before Hurricane Hugo battered South Carolina, typical oceanfront lots went for $200,000 on Isle of Palms, a vacation destination, says Michael Scarafile, president of Carolina One Real Estate in Charleston. After the storm, much of the rebuilding was of bigger, more luxurious houses, he says. By 2006, he says, his average listing on the island was $2 million, partially accelerated by the storm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Overall, it was very healthy for the market," he says. "A lot of the bungalows that were built 50 years ago went away."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the flip side of the trend are people like Jim Torsiello. He bought a vacation bungalow in Ortley Beach for $120,000 in 1986 and shared it over the decades with family and friends who crowded in beds and slept on the floor to be near the shore. He hoped the summer home would stay in the family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Sandy sent 32 inches of water into his 900-square-foot, three-bedroom home, forcing him to tear out the walls. Mr. Torsiello, 70, says it would cost about $80,000 to repair and he is leaning toward selling it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am not a millionaire," says the retired flower-shop owner. "I don't have the money to fix it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That phenomenon is showing signs of changing the social fabric along New Jersey's beaches. Many owners of shore homes there, some built 70 years ago and handed down over generations, are finding the costs of post-Sandy repair out of reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many, like Mr. Torsiello, didn't have flood insurance, and their homeowners policies didn't cover much of the storm damage -- he says he received $1,800 from his policy. Federal and state disaster relief generally doesn't cover second homes such as his.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A heavily damaged house in Mr. Torsiello's neighborhood -- several blocks from the beach -- might sell for the value of its land, roughly $165,000 to $185,000 for a typical lot, then be torn down to make way for a new house that might cost $400,000, says Tim O'Shea, office manager at Birchler Realtors, an Ortley Beach real-estate firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Shea says he recently sold two aging bungalows nearer the beach for $289,000 and $265,000. The buyers plan to demolish them to build more luxurious houses, he says. Of the 40 houses he has sold this year, most will be demolished. "It doesn't matter what the house looks like when we sell it," he says. "The people buying will knock it down and build as big a house as the town will let them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When new buyers rebuild, they must meet stricter codes and must often do as Mr. Anello plans: build up off the ground. Mr. Anello says he doesn't fear storms because his home's newer building methods should withstand nature's ravages. "Everyone is going to build high," he says. "I can't ever see water levels going above eight feet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As larger homes go up, real-estate officials say, some towns could benefit from the added tax revenue and the spending of more-affluent beachgoers. "Financially, 10 years from now, our town will be in far better shape than it was today," says Stephen Acropolis, the mayor of nearby Brick Township. "You're going to have these McMansions coming up everywhere."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some fear that because there will be fewer homes with fewer residents, small businesses will suffer. "If you don't have these secondary residents back," says Paul Jeffrey, president of the nonprofit Ortley Beach Voters and Taxpayers Association, "the pizza shops and the hardware stores that depend on them don't make it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before the storm, prices on beachfront properties were on the rise in New Jersey. Prices held up better on beaches during the financial crisis than elsewhere in the state, says Peter Reinhart, director of the Kislak Real Estate Institute at <span class="companylink">Monmouth University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has put shore homes out of reach for many would-be newcomers, in extreme cases, dramatically: The average listing in Mantoloking is about $2.2 million, according to <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, an online real-estate service, and about $1.2 million in Bay Head, as of mid-October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less-affluent longtime owners have nonetheless remained a big part of the social and business fabric, spending vacations in bungalows and smaller ranch houses that were long a cornerstone of the shore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built decades ago and passed through generations, these dwellings largely exist in middle-class communities like Ortley Beach, Brigantine, Brick Township and Long Beach Township. They are relatively small -- often less than 1,000 square feet -- but boast colorful beach signs, small porches and decades of memories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diane-Monica Lafortune called her duplex "Disgraceland," for reasons she says only a boisterous Irish family can understand. She bought it in 2000 for $295,000, she says. After her husband's death three months later, it became a sanctuary where she could try to forget her loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every summer, Ms. Lafortune drove from her Montreal home to see family in New Jersey, staying in the duplex she shared with a sister. One year, she invited 148 family members for a reunion, where she says Irish priests in the family celebrated Mass and bottles of whiskey were consumed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"After five days, we just had to kick everyone out," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her sister now wants out of the Ortley Beach duplex, which sustained major water damage during Sandy. They didn't have flood insurance. To rebuild, Ms. Lafortune, 58, says she would have to buy her sister's half, demolish the place, and rebuild to code -- at a cost of $500,000 or more. She says she is likely to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents, real-estate agents and architects say several obstacles stand in the way of rebuilding. Older homes stand low to the ground and are often made of wood, which made them easy targets for Sandy's wind, rain and flooding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Repairs can cost more than many people paid for homes, and many homeowners deemed flood insurance too costly even before the storm drove rates higher. In some of New Jersey's most-heavily affected areas, less than 50% had flood insurance, according to a study by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and <span class="companylink">Resources for the Future</span>, an independent think tank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some that had flood insurance are fighting with insurers and say they don't have savings to rebuild without winning the cases. The town of Toms River, which Ortley Beach is part of, estimates that about 70% of Ortley Beach's residences are second homes -- not eligible for government assistance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Emergency Management Agency</span> says 261,884 New Jersey households applied for FEMA grants; 61,375 were approved, with an average payment of $6,000, and others are being processed. FEMA doesn't give aid to second-home owners, a FEMA spokesman says, because "if you have a second home, you have something to go back to."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey says it has given about 15,000 people $10,000 grants to resettle after Sandy and another 140 people rebuilding-and-repair grants totaling $12 million, with another 200 grant signings scheduled and more being processed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Drewniak, a spokesman for Gov. Chris Christie, says Mr. Christie believes the federal government should give rebuilding aid to second-home owners. Without help, many of them are likely to be priced out, unable to pay for rebuilding or insurance, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a concern from immediately after the storm that all our shore neighborhoods won't be able to return to themselves as far as character and being populated by all income levels," he says. "The Jersey Shore was never just a place for large second homes owned by the well-to-do."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If homeowners don't elevate their houses out of harm's way -- in many cases by five feet or more -- they are likely to face flood-insurance premiums that could double or more under a new federal law that attempts to make homeowners pay the actual cost of living near the water. New FEMA flood maps are set to put more people into higher insurance categories if their homes aren't elevated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increased regulatory and insurance costs will likely raise the cost of owning in the area, says Jed Kolko, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. "It could put ownership further out of reach for lower and middle income people," he says. "It's quite possible the mix of people who own homes on the shore changes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">June Squillaro, 72, fears she may be one leaving that mix. Acres of dirt mounds sit in the neighborhood where her place was. She started visiting her family's home there more than 50 years ago with her parents. She consumed her first can of beer there. She later bought the place, and her children and grandchildren came to love it. Because she stayed all year, she kept keys for neighbors who lovingly called her "Aunt June."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Squillaro says her 800-square-foot bungalow by the ocean "was exactly where she wanted to be." She and her husband sold their primary house 10 years ago and chose to retire there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bungalow was devastated by Sandy and eventually razed. Insurance paid $122,000, she says, but she's not sure that will be enough to rebuild. They are renting a small condo -- FEMA granted them $4,000 in rental assistance -- and weighing whether they can afford to return. "I would do anything short of robbing a bank to get back," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Anello, who bought the post-Sandy lot, says he looks forward to building for a long future in Ortley Beach. He plans to take his 13-year-old-daughter to the shore every weekend, and to retire there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I told her, 'Daddy has a chance to build your future,'" he says. "All these people had futures down there for generations. Those houses had been there for 50, 60, 70 years. Now I'm building my future down there."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks closed little changed, with the S&amp;P 500 index reaching another record high, as investors took in stride disappointing results from blue-chip drug maker Merck and mixed economic data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.35 points, or less than 0.1%, to 15568.93. The Dow erased gains of as much as 28.81 points in the final hour of trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P 500 index gained 2.34 points, or 0.1%, to 1762.11, while the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> Composite gave up 3.23 points, or 0.1%, to 3940.13.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record high for a second session in a row, and for the sixth time in eight sessions. The Dow ended 0.7% below its Sept. 18 all-time high close of 15676.94.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The path of least resistance is higher," said Randy Billhardt, head of capital markets at investment bank <span class="companylink">MLV &amp; Co</span>. "The bad news is shrugged off, and the good news is being embraced."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dow component Merck dropped after it reported adjusted third-quarter earnings above analysts' estimates, but revenue that fell a bit shy. Sales of Januvia, a diabetes drug, declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Earnings for the most part have been well received," Mr. Billhardt said. "The market as a whole has held onto some pretty significant gains for the year, which in itself is a pretty significant achievement."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P 500 has gained more than 6% since the unofficial kickoff of earnings reporting season after the Oct. 8 close, and is now up 24% so far this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a about half the S&amp;P 500 companies reporting results through Friday, 75% have beat earnings estimates while 52% have topped revenue forecasts, according to FactSet. The year-over-year earnings growth rate for the third quarter is 2.3%, FactSet said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's all about corporate earnings right now. Earnings are looking strong," said Doug Cote, chief market strategist at ING U.S. Investment Management. "U.S. corporations have proved that despite all the uncertainties ... they can still put up record profits."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production for September rose 0.6% on the month, exceeding expectations of 0.4% growth. Capacity utilization rose to 78.3%, the highest rate since July 2008 and above forecasts of 78%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, pending home sales for September fell 5.6% to the lowest levels seen since December, and missing expectations of a 0.5% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on the 10-year Treasury ticked up to 2.514%, from 2.503% late Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors will also be looking ahead to a statement from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, following the conclusion of a two-day meeting of the central bank's policy-setting committee. The Fed is widely expected to keep stimulus measures, including the $85 billion-a-month bond-purchasing program, intact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cote said although the Fed's accommodative policy has helped support the market, he believes the overall trend higher will continue to be driven by improving fundamentals. "We're in a bull market, based on sound fundamentals," Mr. Cote said. "As long as the earnings come in as they have been, you want to buy into volatility."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December crude-oil futures rose 0.8% to settle at $98.68 a barrel, erasing early losses, while October gold futures ticked down less than 0.1% to $1,352.00 an ounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currency markets were largely quiet, with the dollar inching higher against the euro and the yen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European markets closed mostly lower. The Stoxx Europe 600 slipped 0.2% after being up as much as 0.3% earlier in the session. Germany's DAX 30 index fell 0.1%, France's CAC 40 index lost 0.5% and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 index inched up 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asian markets moved broadly higher, rebounding from recent weakness. Japan's <span class="companylink">Nikkei</span> Stock Average jumped 2.2%, China's Shanghai Composite added less than 0.1%, and Australia's S&amp;P ASX 200 climbed 1% to a five-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other corporate news, <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney</span> rallied following reports that the chief executive of the troubled retailer affirmed its outlook for fiscal third-quarter same-store sales growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Consol Energy</span> slipped after the company agreed to sell five Appalachian coal mines to privately held Murray Energy in a deal valued at $3.5 billion.</p>

</div><div class="author">Josh Barbanel  </div><div>866 words</div><div>28 October 2013</div><div>18:44</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost a year after superstorm Sandy, a study shows the prices and number of sales for homes in New York City's most flood-prone neighborhoods have stabilized and even begun to strengthen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Manhattan condo market had proved resilient even after Sandy flooded basements and lobbies on Oct. 29 of last year, sales had taken months to rebound in heavily damaged areas such as the Rockaways and Staten Island that were located in flood zones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan's financial district, sales were up 44% compared with pre-Sandy numbers, and median prices rose 15%, according to the portrait of the real estate impact of Sandy, by Streeteasy.com. Sales increased in hard-hit neighborhoods such as Howard Beach, Queens—where sales jumped 37%, though median prices were off by 10%. Sales rebounded even in hard-hit Staten Island neighborhoods in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The negative impacts were particularly acute in coastal neighborhoods in the outer boroughs," noted the report, "A Tale of Two Recoveries." "These neighborhoods have consistently underperformed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 250 West St., a new conversion of a TriBeCa warehouse into apartments near the Hudson River was flooded even before the first resident moved in. Now the building is nearly sold out. A 7,200 square foot, four-bedroom penthouse is about to go the market for $39.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer unrepaired damaged homes are listed for sale around the city, brokers said, and the inventory of repaired homes—typically with newly renovated basements, plus new boilers and electrical wiring—is shrinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Rockaways, where most basements and many ground-floor levels were swamped, buyers are back, lured by lower prices. They are more worried about the availability of affordable federal flood insurance, than another giant storm, said Barbara Ferguson, an agent with Rockaway Properties. New, higher flood insurance rates are due out shortly. "If there was a silver-lining to the devastation, it is that families that grew up here and were priced out before Sandy, were now able to move back in," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billy Fitzgerald, a public school principal, said he was "a little apprehensive" when he bought a damaged, white house on Beach 145th Street in the Rockaways at steep discount earlier this year for more than $600,000. He quickly rebuilt the basement and first floor so his family could move in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said a storm like Sandy wouldn't occur for several hundred years. "This is where we grew up, this is all we know," he said "We are rolling the dice a little bit, but everyone who makes this type of investment is taking some risk. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The StreetEasy study found that even the Manhattan market hit the pause button after Sandy smashed New York. In November, the listings in flood zones dipped 21%, and the number of contracts signed slipped 24%, compared with November, 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the numbers bounced back. Contract signings in TriBeCa and the West Village soared, rising faster than in other areas. By last April, contracts were up 28% from the same month, a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leonard Steinberg, a broker at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, said many building owners worked since Sandy to reduce risk by moving utilities out of the basements. "It was a very potent, scary issue a year ago, now there is a much better understanding of how Sandy-like issues can affect a building," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Steinberg is listing the new penthouse at 250 West St., along with Raphael De Niro, another Elliman broker. After Sandy, openings in the building's cellar were sealed to prevent storm-water penetration. Mr. Steinberg said such precautionary measures were less of an issue for the buyer of the penthouse, which has 120 feet of frontage on the Hudson River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The StreetEasy study compiled sales volume and pricing data by evacuation zones, with neighborhoods in zones 1 and 2 at greatest risk of storm damage. It then compared the results to other parts of each borough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data showed that in Manhattan, sales in flood zones rose twice as fast as sales in other parts of the borough after Sandy: They rose 26.9% in the third quarter over the same quarter in 2012, whiles sales rose 12.3% in other parts of the borough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Brooklyn sales were 3.9% below pre-Sandy levels last quarter, while sales in the rest of the borough were up 9.7%. In Queens sales in flood zones lagged behind the rest of the borough until the spring before quickening in the third quarter, rising 38.3% compared with same quarter a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were even signs of improvement in low-lying areas of Staten Island, where Sandy caused widespread damage and flooding. Median prices, down by 42.8% in the second quarter of this year from pre-Sandy levels, were down only by 23.7% by the end of the third quarter. And sales in the third quarter recovered from a dramatic decline earlier in the year to nearly equal those in the quarter before Sandy.</p>
