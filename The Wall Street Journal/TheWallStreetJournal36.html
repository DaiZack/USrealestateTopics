<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ATLANTA -- In the waning days of the Great Recession, the federal government is still jumpstarting the economy and propping up financial markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is also trying to sell Dresden Heights, a failed condo development on a noisy freeway ramp next to a Motel 6, a Waffle House and a Do-It-Yourself Pest Control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than a year, the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. has been seeking a buyer for 36 partially built condos it inherited from a high-flying, short-lived Atlanta bank. The agency has been fending off vandals, haggling with architects and uncovering the developer's blunders, all in a bid to dispose of this condo project, just one of the 2,554 foreclosed assets dumped onto its books. "These are properties with a bad story," says Jim Gallagher, a senior official in the FDIC's Division of Resolutions and Receiverships. "What we're trying to sell is something that is rundown or not completed or has some property damage."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financial crisis started with Americans buying homes they couldn't afford. It is ending with the government struggling to sell buildings it never wanted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past two years, the FDIC has taken over 150 failed banks. In the process, it has seized more than 5,000 houses, subdivisions, buildings, parcels and other foreclosed assets. The current backlog of property stuck on the agency's books, with an appraised value of $1.8 billion, ranges from an $18,700 clapboard home with stained carpets in Birmingham, Ala., to a $1.7 million mountainside lodge with a heated driveway in Steamboat Springs, Colo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxpayers will be grappling with this flotsam for years to come, one example of how the crisis will linger long after the economy begins to revive. At a recent FDIC auction in Atlanta, the agency offered a four-unit condo building it had already sold once before -- after the savings-and-loan crisis two decades ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, it takes the FDIC on average six to eight months to sell a property. Dresden Heights, tied up with unpaid bills, a lawsuit and complex right-of-way questions, is among its toughest prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project was the brainchild of Quantum Homes and its chief executive, Ramsey "Jim" Salahat. In March 2006, just as Atlanta's housing market was peaking, Mr. Salahat took out a $3.78 million, 18-month loan from Main Street Bank in Covington, Ga., to purchase and prepare 5.3 acres abutting an interstate entrance ramp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers brought in a crane, knocked down soaring oak trees, installed sewers and laid out two short roads, Heights Way and Quantum Lane. They planned 80 residential units and seven buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the groundbreaking in May 2007, Mr. Salahat and Quantum President Eyal Livnat posed for photos, wearing white hardhats and digging red Georgia soil with shovels festooned in blue ribbons. They threw a cocktail party, serving wine, roast beef, quiche and cookies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Future homebuyers are quickly reserving space at Dresden Heights . . . so interested homebuyers should act fast to ensure they have a home at this great community," Mr. Salahat said in a news release afterwards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The release quoted Deanna Helie, a "prospective home buyer" who attended the event, as saying: "When this area begins to grow, I want to be in on that growth at an early point."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Helie, who lives adjacent to the Dresden Heights property, said she was talking about the neighborhood only, and stopped by out of curiosity, not to shop. She wondered about the wisdom of building homes next to a pest-control outlet. "I was thinking, 'This isn't going to fly,'" said Ms. Helie, a computer programmer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few days after the groundbreaking, Mr. Livnat signed a two-year, $6.75 million loan from Alpha Bank &amp;Trust, a startup bank in nearby Alpharetta, Ga., to finance construction of the first three buildings. Two dozen customers, most of them first-time home buyers, put down $500 to $1,000 deposits on the condos, which started at $194,900. The developers told the early buyers they would likely be able to move in within a year, according to Kristy Jeffries, who at the time was Quantum's saleswoman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early 2008, work on the project slowed, Ms. Jeffries recalls. People started asking for their money back, "and the builders weren't giving it to them," she says. In her office, located in the basement of a model home, she started receiving calls from disgruntled subcontractors complaining they hadn't been paid. She says one unhappy supplier repossessed Quantum's construction trailer, which still contained file cabinets with records of potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That spring, Mr. Salahat closed Quantum's headquarters in a lavish Atlanta office complex. He moved the company into a cramped, low-budget space behind a chiropractor's office outside of town, where Ms. Jeffries says she went for her paychecks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time Ms. Jeffries saw Mr. Salahat was over a Tex-Mex meal in May 2008, when the developer told her the company was going bankrupt. Former associates say he has moved to Jordan. Neither they nor the FDIC could provide contact information. Mr. Salahat's listed phone numbers in the Atlanta area have been disconnected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a brief interview on his stoop, Mr. Livnat, Quantum's former president, declined to discuss details of the Dresden Heights project. "It was an unfortunate time to start a company," Mr. Livnat said. "Things were at a peak, and it went down quick." Mr. Livnat was skittish about answering the door, and he said he is worried the FDIC or creditors might come after him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alpha Bank foreclosed on the three partly finished buildings a year after Messrs. Salahat and Livnat broke ground. On May 6, 2008, a bank representative stood outside the Dekalb County courthouse and offered the property for sale. No one was willing to beat the bank's $4.692 million minimum. Alpha Bank now owned Dresden Heights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buildings sat exposed to rain, sun and wind through the summer of 2008, prompting bank officials to sign an agreement with McGuire Properties Inc., of Kennesaw, Ga., to finish construction. The company is run by George F. Nemchik, Jr., who was also an Alpha Bank shareholder, according to his attorney and Ms. Jeffries. Mr. Nemchik didn't return calls seeking comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alpha Bank retained Ms. Jeffries to sell units. When she went to pick up her paycheck one day in October, a bank executive told her the lender was on the brink of collapse. He suggested the FDIC might want to keep her on as a sales agent for Dresden Heights. She demurred. "I think that property is cursed," she says now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American government came to own Dresden Heights on Friday, Oct. 24, 2008, about six weeks after the collapse of <span class="companylink">Lehman Bros</span>. Georgia regulators closed Alpha Bank and turned it over to the FDIC. That weekend, Stearns Bank of St. Cloud, Minn., took over Alpha's branches. It acquired just $39 million of the $354 million in assets. The FDIC took possession of the rest, including Dresden Heights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FDIC inspector general's post-mortem blamed Alpha Bank's failure on "management's aggressive pursuit of asset growth concentrated in high risk" residential real-estate development and construction loans. Former Alpha Bank chief executive Joe Briner, now a consultant with a corporate-turnaround firm in Atlanta, didn't return calls seeking comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FDIC wanted the property sold quickly, despite a series of obstacles, including hundreds of thousands of dollars in liens filed against Dresden Heights by building-material suppliers and McGuire Properties, the company that was finishing construction. If enforced by a court, any potential buyer would have to cover those bills before taking possession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, the FDIC's outside property-management firm gave the listing to Atlanta real-estate broker Rob Jordan, a 40-year-old who had spent 10 years as a commercial banker before joining his father in the family firm. These days, Jordan Co. does virtually all of its business selling foreclosed commercial properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jordan and his colleague, David Walmsley, pulled the county records on Alpha's construction loan, a routine step. They stopped cold at the surveyor's description of the property put up as collateral. "Said tract of land contains 6,776 square feet," the documents said of the first parcel. The other two parcels were similarly small.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Messrs. Jordan and Walmsley realized that Alpha Bank and now the federal government owned the three buildings and the land immediately beneath them -- but not an inch more. "What about the sidewalks? The stairs? The stoops?" asks Mr. Jordan. "They're all on someone else's property." The brokers checked with the county and confirmed that even the two small streets running through the subdivision belonged to someone else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That someone else was <span class="companylink">BB&amp;T Corp</span>., a Winston-Salem, N.C., bank. <span class="companylink">BB&amp;T</span> had bought Main Street Bank, which made the original loan to Quantum that allowed the developer to buy the Dresden Heights land. When Quantum went bust, <span class="companylink">BB&amp;T</span> foreclosed on that land and put it up for sale for $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rifling through court records, Messrs. Jordan and Walmsley discovered that Quantum had signed an easement allowing passage between the two properties. But it wasn't clear if the agreement would be legally binding on future owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The murky right-of-way made the sales job far more difficult. The FDIC would have to inform potential buyers there was no guarantee they could gain access to their property without trespassing. The brokers next sought to obtain the building plans, vital documents for anyone hoping to finish the development. In January, Mr. Jordan called Bill vonHedemann of Niles Bolton Associates, the principal architect on the project, to ask for copies. Mr. vonHedemann declined, politely. The developers, he said, owed his firm more than $60,000 in fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone who wants the 85 or so computerized drawings will have to pay for them, he told Mr. Jordan. "We don't give the plans away," Mr. vonHedemann said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jordan didn't worry, initially. Alpha Bank should have had plans on file and regularly sent an agent to the site to check progress. But the brokers found no evidence Alpha had kept such records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, the property was beginning to deteriorate. Over the winter, the outside pipes froze. In March, thieves broke into a model unit and stole the refrigerator, the range and the dishwasher. The FDIC boarded up the ground-floor windows on all of the townhouses, changed the locks, stowed the air conditioners in the garages and hired a full-time security service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Messrs. Jordan and Walmsley fielded nearly a dozen offers, but none was close to the $2.8 million asking price. By May, the brokers worried the FDIC was shooting too high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FDIC ordered two new appraisals, a process that took almost five months. The brokers put off would-be bidders by saying the FDIC was undertaking "internal adjustments," an intentionally vague phrase intended to keep shoppers interested without responding to offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McGuire Properties, the company that had agreed to finish the Dresden Heights construction on behalf of Alpha Bank, dropped its liens on Aug. 17 in the face of a federal law making the FDIC immune to such claims. Instead, McGuire sued the FDIC in federal district court. McGuire contended that after seizing Alpha, the agency had directed the builder to continue work on the condos, and reneged on a promise to pay. The company demanded $653,014 plus interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In court filings, the FDIC denied the main allegations and asked the court to force McGuire to cover the government's legal costs. The two sides are in settlement talks. In September, the agency cut Dresden Heights's asking price 25%, to $2.1 million, and the brokers called the serious prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One repeat bidder was 39-year-old Ho Hyun Chung. Mr. Chung moved from Seoul to the U.S. in 1996 to study business. He stayed to work for the U.S. cell-phone unit of <span class="companylink">LG Group</span>, a South Korean conglomerate. Frequently up late on conference calls with headquarters, Mr. Chung became hooked on TV infomercials touting DVDs and books that promised riches through foreclosed real-estate. "I bought most of them," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, as the real-estate market was tanking, Mr. Chung quit LG and started a business with his wife. Their niche: Buying unfinished foreclosed townhouses and completing them. He says he owns 42 units in 11 properties around the Atlanta area, including five townhouses he bought from the FDIC in December. He says he makes money on some, and loses on others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chung spotted Dresden Heights on the FDIC Web site. He liked that it was inside the perimeter beltway and near two universities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He figured he could make a good return if he put no more than $1.5 million into finishing the project and then sold the units for $130,000 to $145,000 each, generating almost $5 million in gross revenue. It's a plan, he says, that depends heavily on the federal government's $8,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit. The credit, just extended by Congress, expires at the end of April. "If that goes, I don't know how the market will react," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, almost a year after the FDIC seized Dresden Heights, the FDIC and Mr. Chung signed a sales contract giving him 30 days to conduct due diligence. Neither side would disclose the price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only then did Mr. Chung's lawyer notice that the FDIC's buildings were islands surrounded by <span class="companylink">BB&amp;T</span>'s land. Mr. Chung acknowledges the FDIC disclosed the information, but says he "didn't quite understand" the problem until his lawyer raised it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I need to clean that up first," he says. He also wanted to make sure the person who buys the <span class="companylink">BB&amp;T</span> land signs an agreement that allows for the development and sale of the three buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, he asked the FDIC for an extension on his 30-day contingency period. The FDIC turned him down, and the agreement expired.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market has been in a slump for the past four years. When will it ever end?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, real estate has proven as jittery and unreliable as any other market. The average U.S. home price nearly doubled between January 2000 and April 2006, according to the First American LoanPerformance index. Since then, the average has fallen about 30%. The drop has been 53% in the Las Vegas metropolitan area and 39% in Miami, where about a quarter of all households with mortgages are behind on their payments or in foreclosure. The value of your home might be determined more by whether the neighbors keep their jobs than whether the house has ample light and closet space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is a guide to navigating a fractured and volatile market:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Is the housing market getting better?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has shown some signs of healing this year, but the much-touted recovery is tentative and fragile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales have increased from the severely depressed levels of 2008. The inventory of unsold homes listed for sale also is down. Bidding wars are breaking out for foreclosed homes in the sorts of neighborhoods (near jobs and decent schools) that attract both first-time buyers and investors seeking rental properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But more than 6.7 million U.S. households with mortgages, or about 13%, are behind on their payments or are in the foreclosure process, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Eventually, many of them will lose those homes, sending more supply onto the market. Unemployment has continued to rise, and the housing market is unlikely to show a sustained recovery until job growth resumes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the supply of middle-class homes on the market has declined somewhat, it remains ample in most places. And there is a huge glut of high-end houses for sale in many areas. That means prices of high-end homes might still have a long way to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. When will housing bottom out?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There probably won't be any clear turning point. Monthly indicators, such as home sales and prices, tend to bounce erratically from month to month, making it hard to discern the underlying trend. And the housing bust will end at different times in different places. House prices already might have bottomed out in the coveted Virginia suburbs with short commutes into Washington, D.C., for instance. But it probably will be years before all of the unsold condos find buyers in parts of Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generalizations about states or metropolitan areas don't say much about what is happening in your neighborhood. In Summit, N.J., known for good schools and an easy, 45-minute train commute to Manhattan, the median home price in September was up 1.2% from a year earlier, according to Otteau Valuation Group, an appraisal company. In Atlantic City, N.J., which suffers from too much speculative building of condominiums and weak demand for vacation homes, the median price is down about 12% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. What signals should I watch to determine whether my local market is improving?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way to get a sense of supply is to ask a good local real estate agent for stats on how many homes are listed for sale in your town and how many months it would take at the current sales rate to absorb that supply. Anything over about six months generally is considered high, meaning that sellers might have to cut prices. Another way to get a sense of a neighborhood's health is to count the number of for-sale signs and vacant houses. If there are more than a couple vacant homes in a block, that might be a bad sign, particularly if no one is taking care of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes listed for sale has fallen very sharply in some areas. But the supply is likely to balloon again in many areas with a renewed surge in foreclosures. Many local newspapers provide information on foreclosure filings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand depends heavily on the job market. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics provides unemployment rates by metropolitan area. In September, they ranged from 2.9% in Bismarck, N.D., to 30% in El Centro, Calif. State and local agencies provide job-market data, too. Celia Chen, a housing economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com, says help-wanted signs can be a useful local indicator; if you start seeing more of them around your neighborhood, that is a sign that business in your area could be starting to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. How can I figure out the value of my home?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You never know for sure what a home will fetch until you put it on the market, and then it is partly a matter of luck. Will the eager buyer who shares your taste in home style and neighborhood show up on day one or day 200?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Web sites -- including Zillow.com, HomeGain.com and Cyberhomes.com -- provide estimates of individual home values. These estimates are largely based on recent sales of nearby homes, and in some cases they are wildly off the mark. But they often provide a ballpark idea of a home's value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might come closer to the real value by talking to a local agent and looking at recent prices for homes that you know are very similar to yours. If you want to be more scientific and don't mind paying a few hundred dollars, hire a professional appraiser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. Does it matter whether I'm "under water"?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least you have plenty of company. About 20% of owners of single-family homes with mortgages owe more than the current estimated value of their homes, according to Zillow.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you can afford your monthly payment and don't need to move soon, that might not be a big problem. But it is hard, and sometimes impossible, to refinance a mortgage if you are under water, and you will take a bath if you have to sell the home now. Some people who can afford to make their monthly mortgage payments are deciding it doesn't make sense to do so because they don't expect their home values ever to recover to past peaks, and they could rent similar houses for much lower monthly costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. If I lose my home to foreclosure, how long will it take to repair my credit record?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It probably will be three to five years before you can qualify for a home mortgage insured by the government, depending on your circumstances, and that assumes you have re-established a record for paying your bills on time. The foreclosure will remain a blot on your credit record for seven years, likely raising your interest costs even if you do get another loan. If you pay bills on time, keep your credit-card balances low and don't apply for too many cards, you can make a "slow, gradual improvement" in your credit score, says Tom Quinn, a vice president at <span class="companylink">Fair Isaac Corp</span>., which provides tools for analyzing credit records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7. If I'm renting, is now a good time to buy a house?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may well be. Prices in most areas are well below their peaks, even if they haven't hit bottom. Don't kid yourself that you can time the bottom of the market perfectly. But don't feel any pressure to buy in a hurry, because the supply of housing is likely to remain ample for years in many areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally, it doesn't make sense to buy unless you expect to remain in the house for at least four or five years, because the transaction costs -- including commissions for real estate agents and mortgage fees -- are heavy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now is clearly a good time to rent. Many landlords need tenants badly. The national apartment-vacancy rate in the third quarter was 7.8%, the highest in 23 years, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a New York research firm. So landlords are cutting rents and offering such sweeteners as free flat-screen televisions or several months of free rent to retain or attract tenants. Some owners of condos will "cut their throats to get some kind of rental income to cover part of their expenses," says Jack McCabe, a real estate consultant in Deerfield Beach, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8. Can I get a tax credit if I buy a home now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under an expanded and extended program approved by Congress earlier this month, tax credits are available to many people who buy or sign a contract to buy a principal residence by April 30 and complete the purchase by June 30. The tax credit is up to $8,000 for first-time home buyers and $6,500 for people who already have owned a home for at least five consecutive years during the previous eight years. The credit is available for individual taxpayers with annual incomes of up to $145,000 or joint filers with incomes up to $245,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9. Can I get a mortgage on attractive terms?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only if you have a good credit record, a moderate amount of debt in relation to your income and the ability to fully document your income. That last requirement is fairly easy for people who work for a salary and have had the same employer for more than two years, but it can be tough for self-employed people with incomes that vary substantially from year to year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A borrower with a strong credit score of 740 or higher (on the scale of 300 to 850) and the ability to make a down payment of at least 20% could get an interest rate of about 5% with no origination fees on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, says Lou Barnes, a mortgage banker in Boulder, Colo. But if your credit score is 680, the rate jumps to about 5.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who can't make a down payment of at least 20% generally are being funneled into loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration. That means paying extra fees for the FHA insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowing costs are steeper at the high end of the housing market. For so-called jumbo loans -- those above $729,750 in areas with the highest housing costs or $417,000 in places with the lowest costs -- interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages last week averaged 5.95%, according to HSH Associates, a financial publisher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10. Should I invest in foreclosed homes?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Probably not. A lot of investors chase these properties, and only the most experienced know how to deal with all of the pitfalls. Homes auctioned at trustee or sheriff sales are sold on an as-is basis, and there is no provision for an inspection before you take ownership. If after buying you find out that termites have been treating the floor joists as an all-you-can-eat buffet, that is your problem. You must pay for the full price within a day or two, so you need a lot of cash or access to special short-term loans for investors that come with interest rates of around 18%. This is a pursuit best left to people with a lot of time, nerve, cash and knowledge of the local market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand is expected to be strong Monday for the first sale of commercial-mortgage-backed securities under a government rescue program designed, in part, to ease the mounting stress in the commercial-property sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the strong demand is partly a reflection of the conservative underwriting of the $400 million in bonds backed by 28 <span class="companylink">Developers Diversified Realty Corp</span>. shopping centers, in terms of the quality of the assets underlying the loan and the loan amount relative to the value of the properties. While the deal may help reopen a vital funding source for some commercial-property investors, it will likely provide little solace to owners of tens of billions of dollars of office buildings, shopping centers and other commercial real estate that are now worth less than their mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal is the first issue of commercial-mortgage-backed securities under the Federal Reserve's Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, program. Under the program, investors can borrow from the Fed as much as 85% of the CMBS bonds' value by pledging the securities as collateral. By taking advantage of that leverage, investors will be able to boost their returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale of the real-estate investment trust Developers Diversified bonds is more than three times oversubscribed, according to price talk among investors who are considering buying the paper. The healthy appetite enabled <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>., the underwriter of the issue, to lower the unleveraged yield of the top-tier class of the bond issue to about 4%, those investors said. Many analysts and investors had expected the yield to be above that amount. A Goldman spokesman declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a great execution for the borrower," says Scott Simon, managing director and head of mortgage- and asset-backed securities portfolio manager at Pimco, a leading bond house. "If other real-estate investors can borrow money at that rate, it would be a real game changer for the commercial real-estate market that has been so devoid of financing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Simon declined to comment on whether Pimco would buy any of the Diversified Realty bonds. Bids for the securities are expected to come from many mutual funds, insurance companies and other institutional investors. Firms that are considering the deal include <span class="companylink">Babson Capital Management</span>, the investment-management unit of <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">Principal Financial Group</span>, according to people familiar with the matter. Babson Capital declined to comment. A representative at <span class="companylink">Principal Financial</span> didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Institutional investors are attracted to the deal because it is viewed as a low-risk investment with relatively healthy returns when compared with five-year Treasurys, which are yielding about 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors buying the triple-A slice of the deal, totaling $323.5 million, can get an unleveraged return of about 4%, according to price information distributed to possible investors by Goldman late Friday and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. If they finance their purchases with TALF funding, their returns can rise to about 6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The credit-starved real-estate industry and federal regulators are hoping that Developers Diversified's debt sale will pave the way for other CMBS deals and help uncork a market that had been one of the most important funding sources for commercial real estate in the past decade. They are worried that unless financing sources can be resurrected, the pain in the industry will get worse, threatening to unhinge the nascent economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal reflects the high bar the Fed has set for loans eligible for TALF financing. The 28 shopping centers in 19 states securing the bonds have stable cash flow because they often are occupied by discount retailers that tend to attract business even in a recession. For instance, one of the properties is Hamilton Marketplace, near Princeton, N.J., a 957,000-square-foot property whose tenants include <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart Stores</span>, <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span>, <span class="companylink">BJ's Wholesale Club</span> and supermarket ShopRite. According to credit rater Fitch Ratings, the property has maintained an average occupancy of 96.7% since 2006 and is 95.1% occupied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $400 million loan represents about half of the value of the underlying properties. By comparison, in the years before the financial crisis erupted in mid-2007, banks were willing to lend more than 70% of a property's value because the debt could be easily sold as CMBS. Even under a "stress" scenario, according to Fitch, the Developers Diversified properties would produce a cash flow of about 1.44 times what is required to service the debt. Back when credit was easy, the ratio for stress scenarios would even fall below one for many CMBS offerings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Developers Diversified deal also differs from past deals because the offering has been carved up into only three slices, with the Triple-A class representing about 80% of the deal and the rest consisting of Double-A and Single-A classes. Past deals often had more than 10 classes from investment grade to noninvestment grade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market appears willing to accept very conservatively underwritten commercial mortgages backed by strong sponsors," says Thomas Zatko, managing director of the real-estate finance group at Babson Capital. "The availability of TALF financing is icing on the cake."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers Diversified, Beachwood, Ohio, announced in early October that it had borrowed the $400 million first mortgage from Goldman. The investment bank, which converted the five-year mortgage into CMBS, is expected to select buyers for that paper on Monday and close the deal Nov. 25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CMBS offerings are considered one of the key tests for the TALF program, introduced by the Fed in March. Since then, TALF has been viewed as a moderate success, helping borrowers from auto companies and credit-card issuers raise capital. The Fed has made more than $40 billion in TALF loans to investors buying these securities, which has sparked a market rally and reduced the cost of borrowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed extended TALF to include newly issued CMBS in June.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand is expected to be strong Monday for the first sale of commercial-mortgage-backed securities under a government rescue program designed, in part, to ease the mounting stress in the commercial-property sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the strong demand is partly a reflection of the conservative underwriting of the $400 million in bonds backed by 28 <span class="companylink">Developers Diversified Realty Corp</span>. shopping centers, in terms of the quality of the assets underlying the loan and the loan amount relative to the value of the properties. While the deal may help reopen a vital funding source for some commercial-property investors, it will likely provide little solace to owners of tens of billions of dollars of office buildings, shopping centers and other commercial real estate that are now worth less than their mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal is the first issue of commercial-mortgage-backed securities under the Federal Reserve's Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, program. Under the program, investors can borrow from the Fed as much as 85% of the CMBS bonds' value by pledging the securities as collateral. By taking advantage of that leverage, investors will be able to boost their returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale of the real-estate investment trust Developers Diversified bonds is more than three times oversubscribed, according to price talk among investors who are considering buying the paper. The healthy appetite enabled <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>., the underwriter of the issue, to lower the unleveraged yield of the top-tier class of the bond issue to about 4%, those investors said. Many analysts and investors had expected the yield to be above that amount. A Goldman spokesman declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a great execution for the borrower," says Scott Simon, managing director and head of mortgage- and asset-backed securities portfolio manager at Pimco, a leading bond house. "If other real-estate investors can borrow money at that rate, it would be a real game changer for the commercial real-estate market that has been so devoid of financing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Simon declined to comment on whether Pimco would buy any of the Diversified Realty bonds. Bids for the securities are expected to come from many mutual funds, insurance companies and other institutional investors. Firms that are considering the deal include <span class="companylink">Babson Capital Management</span>, the investment-management unit of <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">Principal Financial Group</span>, according to people familiar with the matter. Babson Capital declined to comment. A representative at <span class="companylink">Principal Financial</span> didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Institutional investors are attracted to the deal because it is viewed as a low-risk investment with relatively healthy returns when compared with five-year Treasurys, which are yielding about 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors buying the triple-A slice of the deal, totaling $323.5 million, can get an unleveraged return of about 4%, according to price information distributed to possible investors by Goldman late Friday and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. If they finance their purchases with TALF funding, their returns can rise to about 6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The credit-starved real-estate industry and federal regulators are hoping that Developers Diversified's debt sale will pave the way for other CMBS deals and help uncork a market that had been one of the most important funding sources for commercial real estate in the past decade. They are worried that unless financing sources can be resurrected, the pain in the industry will get worse, threatening to unhinge the nascent economic recovery.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House hunting usually slows down this time of year, as people put their searches on hold during the holidays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This winter could be different, however, thanks to the extension -- and expansion -- of the first-time home-buyer tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're going to see far more interest in the fourth quarter than we generally do because of the tax credit," says Heather Fernandez, vice president of Trulia.com, a real-estate search engine. Traffic surged on the site on Nov. 5, the day Congress approved the credit extension, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new law extends the tax credit for first-time home buyers and opens it up to some existing homeowners as well: The credit is now up to $8,000 for first-time buyers and up to $6,500 for repeat buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All buyers must have a binding contract on a house in place on or before April 30. The purchase must be for a principal residence and must close on or before June 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be considered a first-time home buyer, an individual must not have owned a home in the past three years. And to be eligible, existing homeowners need to have lived in the same principal residence for five consecutive years during the eight-year period that ends when the new home is purchased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Income limits have risen as well. According to the Internal Revenue Service's Web site, www.irs.gov[http://www.irs.gov], the home-buyer tax credit phases out for individuals with modified adjusted gross incomes between $125,000 and $145,000, and between $225,000 and $245,000 for people filing joint returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inclusion of move-up buyers might inspire homeowners to take action and list their house if they've been putting it off, says Carolyn Warren, a Seattle mortgage broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If people love their home, it's not going to entice them to sell," Ms. Warren says. "If they've had it in the back of their minds and really would like to move up, it might push them into doing it sooner than later."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're thinking of purchasing a home, here are five tips:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1) Don't procrastinate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Start your house search now. Getting an early start will give you a better chance of finding the right house before the credit deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When first-time buyers thought that the credit would expire Nov. 30, people scrambled to find properties in September and October, says Pat Lashinsky, chief executive of ZipRealty, a residential real-estate brokerage firm. In some cases, "there wasn't inventory that fit people's needs," he says. In some markets, including Phoenix, Chicago and parts of California, for example, properties had multiple bidders, Mr. Lashinsky adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before you start house hunting, get preapproved for a mortgage, says Eddie Fadel, a Miami-based mortgage banker. And do a realistic assessment of what you can afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers who have to sell an existing home should price it aggressively from the beginning to drum up interest and get a buyer as soon as possible, Ms. Fernandez says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2) Don't count on another extension</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The credit won't be available forever, Mr. Fadel says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a medication for the housing crisis," he says, "Once the patient -- which is the housing market -- is cured, there will be no medication needed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3) Be mindful of interest rates</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates are low right now, but will likely rise next year, Ms. Warren says. Higher rates will affect your monthly mortgage payments, thus the affordability of the house you are buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's pretty universally accepted that rates will be higher next year," she says. "What is unknown is how fast and by how much."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages have been hovering around 5%. But when the Federal Reserve stops buying large amounts of mortgage-backed securities next year, interest rates could rise, Ms. Warren points out. The Fed plans to end its purchase program in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4) Communicate with your lender</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Make sure you're speaking with your lender regularly to avoid any delays. If the lender asks for any additional documentation, turn it in as soon as possible, says Doug Heddings, a New York-based real-estate agent with <span class="companylink">Charles Rutenberg Realty</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And think twice before pursuing a short sale. That's where someone sells a home for less than what he or she owes on a mortgage, with permission of the lender. The process can be lengthy and unpredictable because the homeowner's lender has to approve any deal, Ms. Warren says, and it can get complicated when there is a second mortgage associated with the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5) Don't take shortcuts</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't forgo any of the steps you would normally take just to make the tax-credit deadline. That means making sure the house is a good fit and is in the right location and getting a home inspection, Mr. Lashinsky says. Skipping steps could cost you in the long run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Don't let the tax credit get you to make a decision to buy a house that you wouldn't otherwise want to buy," he says. "Don't shortcut the process to get the tax credit."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp;Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Smyrna, Ga., dateline on a Page One article Friday about new-home buyers seeking smaller, simpler homes was incorrectly given in some editions as Smarmy, Ga. In the same article, the BridgeMill development should have been stated as being in Lancaster County, S.C. The article incorrectly said North Carolina.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ November 14, 2009)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SMYRNA, Ga. -- For the first time in four decades in the luxury-home business, executives at John Wieland builders are thinking the unthinkable: Maybe houses in the South don't really need a fireplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're also wondering whether new homes require 4,700 square feet of living space. Or private theaters with 100-inch screens. Or super-size-me foyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As they draw up blueprints for the house of the post-recession future, builders are struggling to distinguish among what home buyers need, what they want and what they can live without -- Jacuzzi by Jacuzzi, butler's pantry by butler's pantry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have to keep taking things out until you hit a critical point where people reject your product," said Jeff Kingsfield, senior vice president of sales at Smyrna-based <span class="companylink">John Wieland Homes &amp;Neighborhoods</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's an experiment brought on by necessity. Two years ago, closely held Wieland was building 1,800 houses a year in posh subdivisions in Georgia, Tennessee and the Carolinas, selling for an average of $650,000 apiece. Today, the company is closing on just 600 homes annually, according to Wieland. It has slashed staff to 330 employees from 1,100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American housing market continues to drag, with the Mortgage Bankers Association reporting Thursday that applications for home-purchase loans have hit a nine-year low, plunging a seasonally adjusted 11.7% in the week ending Nov. 6 from the previous week. U.S. sales of newly built homes have fallen sharply as well, from 1.3 million in 2005 to 485,000 last year. The latest Census Bureau data suggest that this year's sales will be even lower. Just 294,000 new homes sold through the first nine months of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More often than not, builders say, post-crash buyers of new homes want smaller and simpler. The average new single-family house peaked at 2,507 square feet in 2007 and has since slipped to 2,392 square feet, according to Census Bureau data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average prices are sliding, too, by 16% -- to $269,200 -- between the first quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of this year, the Census Bureau reports. Wieland has been hit worse than most. The company's average sales price has already dropped $153,000, to $497,000, or about 24%. And company executives expect that a year from now, 85% of its homes will go for less than $430,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has forced Wieland to design a new range of compact homes and reconsider everything that goes into them. Replacing tiled tubs with fiberglass units can slice $4,000 off of the house price. Skipping the fireplace can slash an additonal $3,500. In its place, Wieland is trying out a media wall -- essentially a place to hang a big television, surrounded by shelves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Paula Bishop, one of the company's architects, designed the 4,700-square-foot Arden, a 107-foot-long, five-bedroom, three-stairway showcase planned for a lot near Suwanee, Ga. The laundry room was 10-by-7, the mudroom 12-by-8. Including the bedroom, bathroom and his-and-hers walk-in closets, the master suite stretched almost 40 feet. Above the garage was a guest suite with its own kitchen and rec room. A covered breezeway stood off the vaulted breakfast room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wieland never built the Arden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The price point has dropped in the neighborhood," Ms. Bishop explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the company told her to squeeze 900 square feet and $60,000 out of the original $650,000 design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other day, Ms. Bishop sketched a new Arden on tracing paper. She erased the rear staircase and flattened out the bay window. She cut the 94-square-foot pantry in half. She turned the mud and laundry rooms into a mud-and-laundry room. The three-car garage remained, but she redrew it so two cars now had to be parked bumper to bumper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I haven't gotten to the second floor yet, but it will be a ton smaller," Ms. Bishop promised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend toward smaller homes hasn't hit all builders evenly. Winchester Homes, a Bethesda, Md.-based unit of <span class="companylink">Weyerhaeuser Co</span>., is launching five new floor plans between 1,973 and 2,800 square feet, the smallest homes the company has ever produced. Vintage Communities, a privately owned developer in Southern California, plans to unveil a 2,900-square-foot, $1 million-plus model when the market improves -- replacing a 3,600-square-foot house that it had priced as high as $1.5 million in Rancho Santa Fe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>., a Horsham, Pa.-based home builder whose average home sells for $600,000, reported this week that net contracts for new homes rose 42% in the three months ended Oct. 31. The company says its luxury customers are more skittish about buying than they used to be, but, when they do make a purchase, they still want large homes with all the frills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not so Aaron and Meredith Easley, who put aside the temptation to buy a foreclosed 4,500-square-foot manse and instead bought a 3,200-square-foot Wieland home in Pineville, N.C. "We weren't so concerned about square footage," said Mr. Easley, a 31-year-old trainer with <span class="companylink">BB&amp;T Corp</span>. "I'm not all about keeping up with the Joneses."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, there are few Joneses to keep up with. The Easleys were the first family to move into what's planned to be an 800-home development, living alone amid empty model houses and expanses of graded land. Wieland executives were so happy to have someone move in that they finished the attic level and put in hardwood stairs for free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a lot more that comes with those McMansions," said Mr. Easley, whose wife is a kindergarten teacher. "There's a lot more cleaning. There's a lot more heating, a lot more cooling."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wieland believes the market downshift reflects "a fundamental change in the way people are going to want to live," and not just a reaction to scarce credit and insecure jobs, said F. David Durham, senior vice president. "We're not waiting for things to return to the way they were."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift is visible at BridgeMill, a Wieland subdivision in Lancaster County, N.C. The early houses, built near the front gate during the go-go years early in the decade, are massive brick structures. Further inside come the post-boom homes, more cottage than mansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The juxtaposition can prove awkward for Wieland. The company's new, smaller homes sometimes compete for buyers with bigger houses it built just a few years ago that hard-pressed owners are now reselling at a discount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The turbulent market has led the builders to ponder just where they -- and their customers -- went wrong. Easy credit allowed some buyers to purchase more house than they could afford. And, in reflective moments, Wieland officials wonder if the builders simply fell in love with the idea of creating giant houses loaded with cherry cabinets, body-spray showers and built-in wine coolers. Builders built them because they could; buyers bought them because they could.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fearful that their market is evaporating, company executives have spent the past few months trying to figure out what buyers are willing to give up, and what they aren't. On the latter list are four bedrooms, a downstairs powder room, a garage that fits at least two cars, and granite countertops in the kitchen. "We feel that's one of the things homeowners are still holding onto," said Shane Roach, vice president of home-building operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The master bedroom must have its own bathroom, with separate tub and shower. The tub is still big, but the jets, standard equipment for at least a decade, are now optional in new models. It turns out few buyers used the jets more than a couple of times. The children get one-piece, fiberglass tub-shower combinations, instead of tiled walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "home-management" center -- a built-in desk in the family room -- has disappeared from the newest plans. Such luxuries are now available at an extra charge. Window casings are 2 3/4 inches wide instead of 3 1/2 inches wide in one scaled-down model that Wieland is just now putting on the market. In another, company officials want to move a master-bedroom window from the side wall of the house to the rear. Smaller houses come on smaller lots, and having a window on the side makes it hard to avoid noticing that the neighbor's house is just a few yards away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other day, Mr. Kingsfield, the company's sales chief, pulled into a golf-club development near Canton, Ga., and stopped at a lot where workers were listening to mariachi music as they stacked bricks to form the facade of a 3,335-square-foot home called the Madison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple of years ago, a new house in this neighborhood would likely have had a two-story foyer that framed the curved staircase inside. But the Madison's staircase is neither grand nor visible from the front door. In fact, it climbs out of the mud room next to the garage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In an ego-driven market, it's where you walk in the door and impress friends with the staircase," Mr. Kingsfield said. "That's gone. It's not about impressing anymore. It'll still be nice. There will still be wood, still be trim. But it's more conservative."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Madison is more rectangular than its predecessor, the 3,750-square-foot Coventry. Curves and corners add cost. The powder room doubles as the guest bathroom. A folding door will conceal the fiberglass tub from dinner guests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bishop, the architect, is in charge of designing a new series of 2,500-square-foot single-family houses, tiny by Wieland standards of old. They're so petite that the double garage -- 19 feet across -- takes up half of the facade. To combat ugliness, she puts a porch on the other half and decorates the garage doors with trompe l'oeil seams and handles to look like carriage doors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no formal living room or grand entryway. So she joins the family room, kitchen and breakfast area into one open space, just visible down a narrow hallway from the front door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People enter and are in danger of being underwhelmed," admits Ms. Bishop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what happened in the Oconee, one of the new economy designs. The master suite absorbed almost half of the second floor. That left little space for the other three bedrooms. The smallest was so cramped that buyers rebelled. Wieland sold one Oconee and then scrapped the design.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This Just In: Chung, Povich</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Buy in Washington</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connie Chung and Maury Povich are in contract to buy a home listed for $8.98 million in the Embassy Row area of Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The house just felt extraordinarily right," says Ms. Chung, adding that Mr. Povich had been trying for years to get her to move to Washington, where the veteran anchor and talk-show host both grew up. The 12,500-square-foot English manor-style home they picked has seven bedrooms and sits on a third of an acre. The house includes a music room and rooftop terrace and comes with a pool. The couple, with their son, plan to move from New York in 2010 or 2011, says Ms. Chung. She declined to say how much they're paying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built around 1929, the home was gut-renovated in 1990 by the sellers, Stephen Simon, the composer and former music director of the Washington Chamber Symphony, and his wife, Bonnie, its former executive director. Nancy Taylor Bubes of Washington Fine Properties represented Ms. Chung and Mr. Povich. William F. X. Moody and Robert Hryniewicki, also of Washington Fine Properties, represented the Simons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ex-Lehman Official's Deal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. president Joseph M. Gregory has gone into contract on his seven-acre Manchester, Vt., estate, which he listed for $2.48 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gregory has also sold his guest house, across the street from the main house. After more than 30 years at Lehman, Mr. Gregory resigned from his post in June 2008; Lehman filed for bankruptcy-court protection from creditors on Sept. 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gregory bought the seven-acre Vermont property for $675,000 in 1993, according to public records. A six-bedroom farm-style house sits on the property, which also has a barn with a three-bedroom guest apartment above. The guest house went for $715,000, 10% less than his asking price. He bought that two-acre property for $180,000 in 2000. Sunny Breen of Main Street Realty represented Mr. Gregory in both deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gregory's 2.5-acre oceanfront estate in Bridgehampton, N.Y., remains on the market with an asking price of $27.9 million. Michael DeSario of <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span> has that listing. Mr. Gregory couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Football's Gogolak Lists</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retired placekicker Peter Gogolak, whose soccer-style of kicking in the 1960s and 1970s won wide acceptance in pro-football, has listed his Darien, Conn., home for $5.5 million. Mr. Gogolak, 67, played for the New York Giants and the Buffalo Bills in those decades; now he and his wife, Kathy, buy, renovate and sell homes in Connecticut. The couple bought this home, their 11th, in 2005 for $3 million and spent eight months restoring it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three-story, Colonial-style home of about 8,000 square feet sits on two acres and has five bedrooms. The basement includes a media room, where family and friends root for the Giants. Ms. Gogolak adds: "There's a lot of screaming and yelling for football." Chris Merritt and Janet Olmsted of Halstead Property have the listing.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">The Lowdown on Home-Buyer Tax Credits</span>
</div><div class="author">By Laura Saunders </div><div>1269 words</div><div>12 November 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, President Barack Obama signed a law that extends through next spring a temporary tax credit of up to $8,000 for some first-time home buyers, which was due to expire Nov. 30. The law also adds a new tax credit of up to $6,500 for certain repeat home buyers. The package, which the government estimates will cost a total of $11 billion, is intended to help spur housing sales, a critical part of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some answers to common questions about the new rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: What has stayed the same in the new law?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: 1) First-time home buyers still get a credit of as much as 10% of the purchase price, up to a maximum $8,000. "First-time" means people, including both partners of a married couple, who haven't owned a principal residence for three years before the purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2) All taxpayers who claim a credit must use the home as a principal residence for the next three consecutive years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3) The credits offer dollar-for-dollar reductions of tax and are refundable. This means that a taxpayer who doesn't pay enough tax to offset the credit can get a refund. For example, if you qualify for an $8,000 credit but only owe $5,000 in tax, you could receive a $3,000 check from the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4) Under the new law, as under the old, 2009 home buyers may claim the credit on either their 2008 or 2009 returns, and 2010 buyers may claim the credit on either their 2009 or 2010 returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5) Taxpayers do not qualify for a credit if they buy from a lineal ancestor or descendent, including parents or grandparents and children or grandchildren.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: What has changed?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Several important features took effect as of Nov. 6:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1) To take advantage of the tax credits, a buyer must have a contract in place before May 1, 2010, and the deal must close before July 1, 2010. No further extension is expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2) The price of the house is now capped. For purchases made after Nov. 6, no credit is available for any home costing more than $800,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3) There is now a tax credit for repeat buyers as well as for first-time buyers. Taxpayers who have lived in one residence for five consecutive years of the past eight can now qualify for a tax credit of as much as 10% of the purchase price, up to a maximum $6,500, of a new principal residence. The new home does not have to cost more than the old one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4) Income limits for people who qualify for a tax credit are far more generous than under the previous law. For single filers, the credits now phase out between $125,000 and $145,000 of modified adjusted gross income; for married couples, the range is $225,000 to $245,000. For most people, modified adjusted gross income will be the same as adjusted gross income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5) The new law contains anti-abuse measures designed to stem fraud, which became a problem with the previous home-buyer tax credit. Most buyers must be 18 or older, and no taxpayer may take a credit if he or she is claimed as a dependent on someone else's return. Taxpayers taking the credit will also have to furnish proof of purchase. According to Robert Dietz of the National Association of Home Builders, this will usually be a HUD-1 form.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6) People taking the tax credit, as under the old law, aren't allowed to buy a home from a lineal ancestor or descendent. The new law, applying to purchases made after Nov. 6, also says a person may not take a credit if the home is purchased from a spouse or the spouse's lineal relatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: If I bought a house last spring or summer, can I get a tax credit?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: You qualify if you are a first-time buyer and meet the other requirements, but not if you are a repeat buyer. The new credit for repeat buyers applies only to purchases made after Nov. 6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: What is the definition of "principal residence"?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: If you own more than one home, your principal residence is usually the one where you spend most of your time. In determining residence the IRS may also consider where your family lives and your mailing address for bills and correspondence, among other factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Can a principal residence be something besides a conventional house?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Yes. A principal residence may also be a condominium, co-op apartment, attached or semi-attached townhouse, or even -- if it has eating, sleeping and toilet facilities -- a boat, motor home or trailer. Manufactured homes qualify in some states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Does the person who claims the credit have to use the home as a principal residence?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Yes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: If I buy a new home and live in it, do I also have to sell my old one in order to take advantage of the credit?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Al This is unclear. The law appears to allow repeat buyers to retain their old home, for which no tax credit was given, while claiming a credit for the new one. What is clear is that if you buy a new home using the credit, you must use it as your principal residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: How may the credits be allocated among two or more unmarried buyers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: This also is unclear. But if the IRS adopts the rules that applied to the previous tax credit, which are detailed in IRS Notice 2009-12, there is room for planning. The notice says that taxpayers may use "any reasonable manner" to allocate the credit. It even provides an example in which two unmarried buyers allocate the credit to the lower earner in order to qualify for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: I need the credit refund to help make the down payment. What can I do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: There's no rushing the IRS. But one option is to adjust your current withholding from your paychecks to reflect the fact that you will be taking the credit later. But be careful: If you don't make the purchase, then you may owe interest and penalties. Consult a tax adviser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Is it possible to qualify for a credit if I am building a home on a lot I already own?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Yes, according to the National Association of Home Builders. The purchase date is usually considered to be the date of first occupancy, so you would need to move in before July 1, 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: May I take a credit if I am building a large addition to my home?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: No; these credits apply only to the purchase of a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Are there special rules for the military?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Yes. In general, members of the military and foreign-service and intelligence communities who are serving overseas on "official extended duty" for at least 90 days during 2009 and the first four months of 2010 have an extra year to take advantage of these credits. Consult a tax adviser who specializes in this area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Where can I get more information?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Go to federalhousingtaxcredit.com, a Web site sponsored by the National Association of Home Builders. You can also look for links from the IRS's home page, www.irs.gov[http://www.irs.gov], or search for Homebuyer Credit. Another option is to consult a professional tax adviser.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks are moving quickly to restructure commercial mortgages under new U.S. guidelines that are more forgiving of battered property values and can help banks avoid bigger losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>., regional bank <span class="companylink">Whitney Holding Corp</span>. and other lenders around the country are planning to review loans now considered nonperforming to determine if they can be reclassified under the guidelines announced Oct. 30 by bank, thrift and credit-union regulators, according to bank executives and people familiar with the matter. The moves could help the banks absorb fewer losses on troubled real-estate loans and preserve capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a positive all the way around," said James Smith, chief credit officer for <span class="companylink">National Bank of South Carolina</span>, a unit of <span class="companylink">Synovus Financial Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matthew Anderson, partner at research firm Foresight Analytics, estimates that about two-thirds of the $800 billion in commercial real-estate loans held by banks that will mature between now and 2014 are underwater, meaning the loan amount exceeds the value of the property. The flexibility extended by regulators will apply to $110 billion to $130 billion of these loans, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The guidelines are controversial, with critics accusing the U.S. government of prolonging the financial crisis by not forcing borrowers and lenders to confront inevitable problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators respond that they are being prudent, adding that a crackdown will occur at any banks misinterpreting last month's announcement as an opportunity for leniency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We will push banks to be realistic [about losses] and will drag them out of denial if that's what we need to do," Tim Long, senior deputy comptroller at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said in an interview Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regional and small banks are the most likely financial institutions to benefit from the guidelines because of their exposure to commercial real estate. More than 2,600 banks and thrifts have commercial real-estate-loan portfolios that exceed 300% of total risk-based capital, according to an analysis of regulatory filings by The Wall Street Journal. Nearly all of those institutions have less than $5 billion in assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators consider the 300% threshold a red flag, though it doesn't necessarily mean the banks are in danger of failing. Risk-based capital is a cushion that banks use to cover losses. Commercial real-estate woes contributed to 100 of the 120 bank failures this year, according to Foresight Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supporters of the guidelines note that commercial properties still can generate enough cash to pay debt service on mortgages even if they are underwater. In such cases, banks shouldn't be required to classify the loan as delinquent and reserve capital against it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you're going to take a hit, make sure you're taking a hit for a legitimate reason, not because an examiner is making an immediate judgment on the loan," said Tom Flexner, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>'s global head of real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators also suggested ways for banks and borrowers to restructure loans and avoid foreclosure even if the properties can't pay debt service. Banks can carve troubled loans into one performing part and one nonperforming part. That would allow the bank to incur losses on only the nonperforming part, not the entire loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Joe Exnicios, chief risk officer of Whitney's Whitney National Bank unit, of New Orleans, cited a hypothetical example in which a developer borrows money to develop a small retail center and gets a drugstore chain to sign a lease for one store. If the developer can't sell the other sites, he would be unable to repay the loan. Under the new guidelines, the bank could create a healthy, performing loan supported by the drugstore lease and a nonperforming loan from the rest of the loan. "It may make a difference on whether you need to have additional capital and take additional reserves," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics agree that regulatory flexibility might help some banks avoid failure. But the troubled loans remaining on their books will discourage them from lending, reminiscent of Japan's "lost decade" in the 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A better solution, critics said, would be similar to the approach regulators took during the commercial real-estate crash of the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Back then, regulators moved aggressively to force banks to take write-offs and sell off their troubled loans, and the market recovered faster," said Mark Edelstein, head of the real-estate group at law firm <span class="companylink">Morrison &amp;Foerster LLP</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some observers also worry that the guidance could lead to fewer real-estate transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The question becomes: Are you going to invest in new properties knowing that there is this overhang [of troubled loans] that could hit you?" said Michael Straneva, global head of <span class="companylink">Ernst &amp;Young</span>'s transaction real-estate practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankers respond that some critics would prefer that regulators pressure banks to sell assets so they can scoop them up at steep discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The people who are complaining the loudest are the people who want to buy the real estate," said Pat Goldstein, head of real estate for Emigrant Savings Bank in New York City.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">In Orange County, Another Blow</span>
</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi   </div><div>757 words</div><div>11 November 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly a year after regulators closed <span class="companylink">Downey Savings &amp; Loan</span>, the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. has sold the failed thrift's former Newport Beach, Calif., headquarters. The deal, the largest single property sale by the FDIC this year, delivered some more bad news to Orange County's office market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the price wasn't pretty. An affiliate of S.K. Hart Management, a private Salt Lake City company, paid $53 million for the 332,000-square-foot property, also known as Bayview Corporate Center, well below the $70 million that Khosrow B. Semnani, the owner of S.K. Hart, said he offered to pay for the property last year. Mr. Semnani said he made the bid when Downey, a unit of <span class="companylink">Downey Financial Corp</span>., was seeking to sell the property it still occupied in a bid to raise capital before the bank's collapse. The price paid also is well below the $117 million that a nearly identical office complex fetched in 2005, according to <span class="companylink">CoStar Group Inc</span>., a real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Semnani also is in a position to undercut the rest of the market. He will consider lowering rents in the building or offering competitive packages with improvements to bring in tenants. Annual asking rents in the building, considered a Class-A property, already have fallen from about $40.80 a square foot near the peak of the market in 2006 to about $27.60, he said. The going asking rate in the Orange County market for Class-A office space is about $28.44, according to CoStar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar scenarios soon will start playing out in hundreds of markets throughout the country as the commercial-real-estate downturn moves into high gear. Most lenders have been able to resist pressure to dump assets for bargain prices thanks, in part, to help from regulators. But as the number of bank failures mount the FDIC is beginning to accumulate loans and property that it will dispose of at market prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale of Downey's former headquarters complex sheds some light on the challenges facing regulators as they work to dispose of properties. Some 174 commercial properties valued at about $446 million that were once owned by failed banks were earmarked to be sold by the FDIC as of Sept. 30. The portfolio is expected to expand as bank failures mount, said David Barr, an FDIC spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the struggles facing the FDIC: deciding when and at what price to sell in one of the worst commercial-real-estate markets in decades. "Some people might not like the prices we're getting, but in reality that's what the market's bearing," Mr. Barr said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Semnani said he is well-aware of the challenges of buying and leasing a property that is roughly three-quarters vacant in one of the country's toughest office markets. He said he plans to spend several million dollars updating the building, and expects it could take about two years to get the property leased and improve cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you grab a tiger by the tail and you're not watchful, it can hurt you," said Mr. Semnani. "This is a big tiger, but I'm a firm believer in the market and I think it will come back."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The office market in Orange County was among the hardest hit by the subprime mortgage crisis because it was home to a large concentration of troubled lenders. <span class="companylink">U.S. Bancorp</span> has acquired the deposits of the failed Downey thrift, a unit of Downey Financial, which was itself hurt by its push into adjustable-rate mortgages on the West Coast. The county's office-vacancy rate rose to 21.2% in the third quarter compared with a 19.4% average vacancy rate in the major U.S. markets tracked by Property and Portfolio Research, a unit of CoStar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The headquarters complex, comprised of two six-story buildings connected by an atrium, offers balconies and water views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers predict that tenants will be able to cut better deals in Orange County and elsewhere as prime properties sell at discounted prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The next three or four years in Orange County are going to be a very tough time for landlords and a great time for tenants and occupiers to lock down outstanding deals," wrote David Doupe, an international director in Los Angeles with <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, in an email.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices continued to decline across the nation as sales of heavily discounted foreclosed properties weighed down the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median prices of existing homes fell in 123 of 153 metropolitan areas during the third quarter compared with a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. The national median price was $177,900, down 11.2% from the third quarter of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed sales -- mainly foreclosures and short sales -- accounted for 30% of transactions in the third quarter, according to the NAR, which pulled down average prices because foreclosed homes sell at steep discounts. Short sales are transactions in which at-risk borrowers sell their homes for less than the loan amount, with the lender's approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metropolitan areas in Florida and Nevada continued to see the most severe price declines. In the Cape Coral-Fort Myers area, median prices were down 40% during the third quarter from a year earlier, to $98,000. In Las Vegas, median prices were down 34.5% in the third quarter to $138,500. In 2006, median prices were $268,200 in the Cape Coral-Fort Myers area and $317,400 in the Las Vegas area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, home sales rose 11.4% nationwide to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.3 million units during the third quarter, up from 4.76 million units in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist, attributed rising sales to the federal tax credit of up to $8,000 for first-time home buyers. "We can't underestimate just how powerful a catalyst the first-time home buyer tax credit has been for the housing sector," he said in statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Barack Obama signed a bill last week extending and expanding the federal tax credit to include buyers with higher incomes and those who are existing homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun said that while foreclosures will continue to depress the market, "rising sales from the expanded tax credit should stabilize home prices by next spring."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Grayken, the head of real-estate private-equity giant <span class="companylink">Lone Star Funds</span>, wants to raise $20 billion to buy pools of troubled mortgages and other kinds of distressed debt. To get the money, Mr. Grayken is doing what once would have seemed outlandish for a brand-name deal maker like Lone Star: He is cutting some of his fees by more than 50%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concession by Lone Star, which has performed better in the aftermath of the boom than many of its peers, illustrates the rising clout of real-estate investors and the property-fund industry's struggle to regain credibility after a disastrous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most highly leveraged funds, which together own $175 billion in real estate around the world, lost half of their equity value from July 2008 to June 2009, according to the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries and the Townsend Group. The <span class="companylink">California State Teachers' Retirement System</span>, which owns $12.7 billion in real estate, has reported that at least 14 property-investment vehicles in which it invested nearly $1.2 billion are now worth next to nothing. Even as many corporate buyout funds are reporting increasing value as the economy starts to expand again, property-fund managers have told investors to expect value declines to continue into next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Lone Star, the effort to win over investors has shown some results. The board that oversees Oregon's $51 billion public-employee pension fund's investments recently agreed to put a total of $400 million into two new Lone Star funds after the firm agreed to reduce its fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I want all of our managers to make truckloads of money," says Katherine Durant, who heads the pension fund's investment council. "But I want them to make it after a preferred return ... and not on a management fee."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, real-estate private-equity fund raising in the third quarter hit a six-year low of just $4.9 billion, down from $40.5 billion a year earlier, according to research firm Preqin. As big investors, known as limited partners, sift through the wreckage, many are asking whether the high fees they paid -- and how those fee payments were structured -- helped inflate the bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Too many managers made money at the expense of their LPs," says Stephen Coyle, who oversees private real-estate investments for real-estate investment firm <span class="companylink">Cohen &amp; Steers Inc</span>. and says he has pushed prospective fund managers to lower their fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate private-equity funds started about 20 years ago with a simple model. They charged investors a low management fee largely to cover overhead. Then, as they sold mortgages or properties at a profit, the fund managers would take a healthy cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was when few pension funds and college endowments were brave enough to venture into real estate. Everything changed during this decade's boom years, when institutional investors poured money into the asset class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The size of the funds managed by many firms grew from the hundreds of millions of dollars to the billions, and fund managers increasingly were turning a big profit on the management fee, which often stayed at roughly 1%. Critics say that fund managers had an incentive to do bigger and bigger deals, and keep raising more money, with less regard to how well their deals would perform in the long run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate private-equity giant <span class="companylink">Colony Capital LLC</span> was paid $289 million from 2006 to 2008 for managing $12.6 billion of equity raised from clients, according to documents filed in September with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Colony's incentive fee income over the same time period came to $183 million. Colony's troubled deals include the $5.4 billion takeover of <span class="companylink">Station Casinos Inc</span>., which filed for bankruptcy this year. A spokesman said Colony had no comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lone Star's two new funds, Fund VII and Real Estate Fund II, are targeting 25% average annual returns through investments in distressed commercial, residential and corporate debt. Lone Star's Mr. Grayken told the Oregon pension-fund board that he saw an "unprecedented period of supply" of distressed debt and that he would have few competitors in buying it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Grayken founded Lone Star in 1995, and Oregon, which has invested in all of his funds, says it expects to gain an average annual return of 29% from those investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to win new commitments from big investors like Oregon, Lone Star reduced the minimum management fee it will charge in the two new funds to 0.35%, down from 0.75% in its previous fund. In addition, the return hurdle after which Lone Star gets a piece of the profit was raised for investors who put up the most money. Mr. Grayken declined to comment through a spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lone Star isn't the only real-estate fund manager trying to sweeten the deal for potential investors. Ethan Penner, who helped pioneer the securitization of commercial-property loans in the 1990s, is raising two new funds for <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group Inc</span>. affiliate CBRE Investors to buy and originate commercial mortgages. Mr. Penner hopes to raise an initial $500 million for each fund by year's end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To do that, Mr. Penner is offering special benefits to "founding investors": a seat on the fund's advisory board, a first look at opportunities for additional investments, and a share of a 10% ownership interest in the general partnership of the new fund, according to people who have heard CBRE's pitch. That last arrangement means that founding investors would receive a portion of the fees paid to Mr. Penner and his colleagues. Mr. Penner declined to comment through a spokesman.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi </div><div>757 words</div><div>11 November 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly a year after regulators closed <span class="companylink">Downey Savings &amp;Loan</span>, the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. has sold the failed thrift's former Newport Beach, Calif., headquarters. The deal, the largest single property sale by the FDIC this year, delivered some more bad news to Orange County's office market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the price wasn't pretty. An affiliate of S.K. Hart Management, a private Salt Lake City company, paid $53 million for the 332,000-square-foot property, also known as Bayview Corporate Center, well below the $70 million that Khosrow B. Semnani, the owner of S.K. Hart, said he offered to pay for the property last year. Mr. Semnani said he made the bid when Downey, a unit of <span class="companylink">Downey Financial Corp</span>., was seeking to sell the property it still occupied in a bid to raise capital before the bank's collapse. The price paid also is well below the $117 million that a nearly identical office complex fetched in 2005, according to <span class="companylink">CoStar Group Inc</span>., a real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Semnani also is in a position to undercut the rest of the market. He will consider lowering rents in the building or offering competitive packages with improvements to bring in tenants. Annual asking rents in the building, considered a Class-A property, already have fallen from about $40.80 a square foot near the peak of the market in 2006 to about $27.60, he said. The going asking rate in the Orange County market for Class-A office space is about $28.44, according to CoStar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar scenarios soon will start playing out in hundreds of markets throughout the country as the commercial-real-estate downturn moves into high gear. Most lenders have been able to resist pressure to dump assets for bargain prices thanks, in part, to help from regulators. But as the number of bank failures mount the FDIC is beginning to accumulate loans and property that it will dispose of at market prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale of Downey's former headquarters complex sheds some light on the challenges facing regulators as they work to dispose of properties. Some 174 commercial properties valued at about $446 million that were once owned by failed banks were earmarked to be sold by the FDIC as of Sept. 30. The portfolio is expected to expand as bank failures mount, said David Barr, an FDIC spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the struggles facing the FDIC: deciding when and at what price to sell in one of the worst commercial-real-estate markets in decades. "Some people might not like the prices we're getting, but in reality that's what the market's bearing," Mr. Barr said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Semnani said he is well-aware of the challenges of buying and leasing a property that is roughly three-quarters vacant in one of the country's toughest office markets. He said he plans to spend several million dollars updating the building, and expects it could take about two years to get the property leased and improve cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you grab a tiger by the tail and you're not watchful, it can hurt you," said Mr. Semnani. "This is a big tiger, but I'm a firm believer in the market and I think it will come back."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES -- In recent years, millions of Americans looked at their houses and saw big, fat piggy banks. And it occurred to them to take out big, fat new mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few did it on the scale of Ronald Burkle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burkle, the grocery-store billionaire, has $56 million in loans against two houses, including $9 million added last year. One is his iconic Beverly Hills mansion, "Green Acres," a 44-room Italian Renaissance palazzo built in the 1920s by silent-film star Harold Lloyd that more recently was a favorite overnight rest stop for Mr. Burkle's buddy, Bill Clinton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burkle declined to say how he is using the money. There is no indication he needs it to pay the water bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditionally, the super-rich didn't really bother with mortgages. Home loans were for people who carry lunch buckets, not captains of industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That changed in the boom years -- and it is still going on. Recent big-time home borrowers include fashion entrepreneurs, hedge-fund titans and baseball-team magnates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home loans "are a really good source of cheap capital," says Robert Maguire, a real-estate tycoon who built some of the tallest officer towers in L.A. He has borrowed some $50 million against several properties, including his beach house, which features huge picture windows framing the Pacific near Santa Barbara, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has been raising money with an eye toward regaining control of his property firm, <span class="companylink">Maguire Properties Inc</span>., which he lost during the real-estate bust. Even as he borrows against his beach retreat, Mr. Maguire is trying to sell it for $29 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By hocking the house, so to speak, he and others say they are simply borrowing low in hopes of investing in something they believe will yield a high return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And mortgage rates are near historic lows. In April, Mr. Burkle renegotiated his $56 million in adjustable-rate mortgages down to 3.25%, which was in line with adjustable home loans of a more mortal size. Recently, his rate adjusted down to about 2.25%, based on publicly available documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It puts Mr. Burkle's mortgage interest charge at $105,000 a month, give or take.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like ordinary home loans, megamortgages flourished during the boom earlier in the decade. The number of home mortgages in the $3 million-and-up category soared to about 3,000 in 2007, from only 1,100 or so in 2004, according to LPS Applied Analytics, a unit of <span class="companylink">Lender Processing Services Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, mammoth home loans got scarce during last year's near-unraveling of the world economy. But now they are showing signs of coming back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. Trust, which is the private wealth-management arm of <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>., has seen a 33% rise this year in home loans, compared to last year, with the average size over $3 million. Jan Reuter of U.S. Trust says clients are using the cash to buy stocks and other assets. Other major lenders tell a similar story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal tax code doesn't smile upon giant mortgages. It allows mortgage interest to be deducted only on home borrowings of about $1 million or less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are ways around that, says David Adamo of Luxury Mortgage Corp., a mortgage-banking firm in Stamford, Conn. If the cash is used for investment purposes, the loan interest could be used to reduce taxes on income from the investments, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, plenty of rich people still avoid home loans. Partly, it is an image thing. Maria Elena Lagomasino of GenSpring Family Offices LLC, a Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. wealth-management firm, says a mammoth mortgage implies to her that someone is "borrowing because they have to."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One rub for zillionaires who value their privacy: Mortgages are a matter of public record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of New York City's classiest new addresses is 15 Central Park West -- which along with the requisite pool, health club and movie-screening lounge, offers "30 climate-controlled wine rooms" with "solid oak cabinetry." Since the start of last year, five buyers there have taken out mortgages ranging from $10 million and $35 million, according to public information collected by First American Corps.' RealQuest data service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all megamortgages have happy endings. Since mid-May, about a dozen home loans of $3 million to $9 million have been involved in default or foreclosure actions in Malibu, Beverly Hills and other fancy areas around Los Angeles, according to public data gathered by First American. None of the giant mortgages over $10 million examined in detail are in default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Max Azria, chief executive of privately held <span class="companylink">BCBG Max Azria Group Inc</span>. clothing company, took out a $25 million mortgage in April 2008 on a 12-bedroom, 13-bath West Los Angeles mansion, once home to the late TV producer and novelist Sidney Sheldon, according to public records. He bought the house in 2005 for about $16 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Moody's Investors Service, the credit-rating company, said BCBG could face a cash crunch without financial help from Mr. Azria. A BCBG spokesman said Mr. Azria used the mortgage money for renovations and "additional personal liquidity," and that the company restructured and improved its finances this year without funds from him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Israel Englander, who runs the Millennium Management LLC hedge-fund operation in New York, last year pledged a home in a wooded, estate-filled section of Greenwich, Conn., as part of the collateral for a revolving credit line of up to $100 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Englander declined to comment. There is no indication he needed the money for anything other than investment purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides signing multimillion-dollar baseball players, Frank and Jamie McCourt have accumulated homes with multimillion -- dollar mortgages since moving to Los Angeles in 2004 to run the Los Angeles Dodgers. They bought homes and adjacent properties in both West Los Angeles and Malibu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their 15,000-square-foot, 10-bath L.A. manse, located in the prestigious Holmby Hills neighborhood across the street from the Playboy Mansion, was purchased in 2004 for about $20 million. For good measure, the McCourts spent $14 million to upgrade the place, including tearing out the tennis courts to install an indoor, Olympic-size swimming pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, the homes carry some $28 million in mortgages. The houses, which are in Mrs. McCourt's name, are now part of a nasty divorce battle between the couple, who are fighting for control of the Dodgers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The McCourts declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid the acrimony, the estranged couple did agree on one housekeeping matter at a court hearing Thursday: Mrs. McCourt could have exclusive access to the indoor Olympic pool. Swim hours for her are between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Michigan to Italy, contemporary-art collectors are passing on works by international art stars and skipping far-flung art fairs and auctions. This year, they're buying local.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Detroit, major collector and steel company executive Gary Wasserman says he's stopped buying works by England's Anish Kapoor and China's Yue Minjun so he can focus more on buying "powerfully Midwestern" art by artists like Brian Carpenter, whose $1,000 photographs often feature images of dead deer, Lake Erie nuclear reactors and snowy footprints. Swiss collector Guy Ullens, widely known for his vast collection of Chinese contemporary art, says he's also started buying landscapes by Swiss and German painters like Anselm Kiefer to hang in his home in the Alps. Italian collector Pierpaolo Barzan says the only contemporary art fair he's attending this season starts Friday in Turin, Italy, where he hopes to find work by Roman artists like Nicola Pecoraro and Pietro Ruffo. "I believe that I can put together a much stronger collection, and make an impact in the art world, by collecting local artists rather than trying to find the next Chinese star," Mr. Barzan says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the height of the boom, art collectors scrambled to acquire works by top artists from rising markets including China, Russia, India and the Middle East. A serious approach to collecting meant trips to London, New York and Hong Kong several times a year for auctions, and mandatory stops at the art fairs in Cologne, Miami Beach, London, Shanghai and Basel, Switzerland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, a full year since the recession gutted the global art market, collectors are canceling their trips. Some Westerners are now loath to dip into markets like Russian or Indian contemporary art, whose prices soared during the boom but whose long-term value is less established. Many are cutting back on expensive art-buying trips. And some collectors say they're interested in supporting local artists, particularly at a time of economic hardship -- the cultural equivalent of buying an American car instead of an import.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Christie's and <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> begin their major round of autumn auctions in New York, and their offerings were calibrated to suit the mood. Neither house included any Chinese pieces in their closely watched evening sales, a reversal from recent seasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brett Gorvy, Christie's international co-head of postwar and contemporary art, says the company decided to shift Chinese pieces to sales in Hong Kong. "There's been a reluctance in the U.S. and Europe for these works but the appetite is still strong in Hong Kong and Taiwan," he says. At <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> Hong Kong auction last month, for instance, an 18th-century imperial throne sold to an Asian for US$11 million, a world auction record for Chinese furniture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York sales for both houses also include no Indian artists, with the exception of Mr. Kapoor, who was born in Mumbai. Mr. Gorvy says top examples of Indian art were scarce this time around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, both houses have packed their catalogs with works that traditionally appeal to U.S. buyers, like Alexander Calder, Jasper Johns and Joan Mitchell. Tobias Meyer, <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> world-wide head of contemporary art, says the house added artists with strong regional followings, like sculptor Germaine Richier, who is heavily collected in Belgium, and Juan Munoz, a favorite in Spain. Overall, the houses expect to bring in a combined $427.5 million to $606.8 million from their sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art, up from $404.8 million in May but down from $728.9 million last November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collectors began retrenching to artists from their respective cultures in the last few months. Last autumn, Americans took home a third of the art offered at a Christie's sale of Italian art in London. They only bought 4% at a similar sale a few weeks ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jo Backer Laird, an art lawyer at Patterson, Belknap, Webb &amp;Taylor and Christie's former general counsel, says auction houses are continually shuffling their rosters to keep up: "If one major collector in Des Moines is buying an Iowa artist or anything from the Midwest, you can bet the auction houses are paying attention to that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami Beach has emerged as home to one of the world's biggest contemporary art fairs, drawing artists, dealers and collectors from around the globe. Miami vintner and collector Dennis Scholl says he and other buyers in his hometown are now "circling back" to take a closer look at local artists. He has acquired works by Miami artists like Daniel Arsham, whose sculptures evoke melting glaciers and stairwells to nowhere, and Leyden Rodriguez Casanova, a sculptor who turns suburban furniture like sectional sofas into impassable forts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr Scholl says he is "running, not walking from the whole China/India art thing," because he thinks such works became overpriced during the boom. He is still buying work from other internationally known artists, like Olafur Eliasson, but he makes a point of hanging their works alongside examples by local artists, thereby "imparting equal dignity," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marjorie Ornston, a Los Angeles photography collector, has flown to art fairs in Paris and Miami Beach and belongs to the Photograph Council at the J. Paul Getty Museum. But in late October she jumped at the chance to sift through bins of daguerreotypes, wanted posters, and California streetscapes offered up by struggling local dealers in a one-day sale at Dawson's Bookshop in Los Angeles. She paid $475 for a midcentury color photograph of a young Mexican odalisque, a "great price" considering the work's unusual history, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift could be a cultural boon for artists in cities like Atlanta, Austin and Detroit that have been overlooked by the art establishment. In Austin, dealer Lora Reynolds seems like a market anomaly: Sales at her eponymous gallery are "much better" this year than before the market crashed, she says, in part because she expanded into a bigger space and broadened her base of Austin collectors. "We weren't hit as hard by the crisis, and collectors here still want art," Ms. Reynolds adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Works by artists who are primarily known regionally and are carried only by local galleries, of course, are typically far less expensive than those by artists featured in major auctions and art fairs, or in galleries in New York or London. Los Angeles collector Lenore Schorr says buying at a local gallery also often means saving on "pain-in-the-neck costs" like insurance and shipping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collectors may also feel more of a personal connection to artists who live nearby. Mr. Wasserman, the Detroit collector who also sits on the board of Miami's Wolfsonian Museum, buys "electric" abstracts by Beverly Fishman. Ms. Fishman runs the painting department at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in nearby Bloomfield Hills. Mr. Wasserman calls her regularly for art-buying advice, and recently donated one of her works to the Toledo Art Museum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some collectors are wary of the buy-local trend. Belgian collector Mark Vanmoerkerke says he might seem overly nationalistic were he to exclusively collect Belgian art, especially since artists in other parts of the world may be making stronger work at any given time. His collection is more broadly focused around post-conceptual art made in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The process of defining artists by a single geographic signifier can also be a minefield since artists often travel widely and have varied ethnic and cultural backgrounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For artist Colby Bird, going home to show in Austin felt like moving forward. He left Texas at 18 to study art in Colorado and later at the Rhode Island School of Design. Around two years ago, he joined a New York gallery and the Whitney Museum of American Art bought several of his photographs and prints, including one depicting a mattress on top of bags of flour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a gallery in Austin called Okay Mountain invited him to do a show over the summer, he was surprised by the large turnout at the opening, which included internationally known artists like Justin Lowe. The hometown setting inspired him to make a 8.5-meter-wide banner that said "Swagger" in the purple and black colors of his alma mater, Lyndon B. Johnson High School.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, he donated the banner to the high school. "They were psyched," Mr. Bird said. "The basketball coach said, 'We could use some swagger right now.'"</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A profitable quarter for Ford and a round of better-than-expected economic data helped lead stocks higher, though the buying was concentrated in <span class="companylink">United Technologies</span>, <span class="companylink">Procter &amp;Gamble</span> and other blue chips.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a bumpy session during which stocks continued their recent intraday seesawing, shares initially were pushed higher by reports on manufacturing, construction spending and pending-home sales. From there, the morning euphoria evaporated with a decline in financials weighing on the tape. Nearer to the close, stocks turned around, with the broad indexes closing higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 76.71 points, or 0.8%, to 9789.44, marking only the second time in eight sessions that the Dow hasn't closed with a movement of more than 100 points in either direction. Gains were led by components <span class="companylink">United Technologies</span>, up $1.21, or 2%, to $62.66, and <span class="companylink">Procter &amp;Gamble</span>, up 95 cents, or 1.6%, to 58.95.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500-stock index tacked on 6.69 points, or 0.7%, to 1042.88, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 4.09 points, or 0.20%, to 2049.20.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right now, the market is looking back and trying to find more evidence of an economic turnaround," said Daniel Morgan, a portfolio manager with <span class="companylink">Synovus Securities</span>. "With what we're going into the market with, it's mostly dividend-paying stocks. We think the market's toppy, so at least we'll have the dividend to pay us while we wait for the economy to actually improve."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the economic front, the rest of the week will be dominated by a Federal Reserve monetary-policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, as well as the nonfarm-payrolls report on Friday. The report is expected to show the U.S. unemployment rate inching closer to 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earnings also will continue to roll in after one corporate report lent help to Monday's move in stocks. Ford tacked on 58 cents, or 8.3%, to 7.58, as the car maker reported a third-quarter profit and said it would be "solidly profitable" in 2011 on cost cutting and a turnaround in its North American business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bucking the trend of recent weakness, health care was particularly strong. <span class="companylink">Human Genome Sciences</span> and <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> said their experimental drug Benlysta met the goal of a second late-stage study in treating lupus, increasing the drug's chances of becoming the first treatment in decades for the autoimmune disease. Human Genome (Nasdaq) closed up 6.59, or 35%, to 25.28, while <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> lost 45 cents, or 1.1%, to 40.71.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Varian Medical Systems</span> gained 2.20, or 5.4%, to 43.18, after the cancer-therapy-systems maker said it signed an agreement with Portugal's Instituto Portugues Oncologia, the state-run cancer hospital, to supply it with new radiosurgery and radiotherapy capabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drug developer <span class="companylink">Vertex Pharmaceuticals</span> (Nasdaq) increased 2.59, or 7.7%, to 36.15, after saying a Phase II study showed that twice-daily use of experimental hepatitis C treatment Telaprevir was comparable to three times a day. The dosing change could increase patient convenience and give a competitive advantage versus others developing therapies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fertilizer maker CF Industries Holdings overhauled its takeover bid for rival <span class="companylink">Terra Industries</span> with a new offer that is mostly cash and about $200 million higher. Terra finished the session up 2.14, or 6.7%, at 33.91, while CF rose 84 cents, or 1%, to 84.09.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perrigo (Nasdaq) gained 91 cents, or 2.5%, to 38.10, after posting a 61% increase in fiscal first-quarter earnings. The generic drug maker also boosted its full-year earnings forecast and said it is selling its Israel consumer-products unit for about $54.4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">U.S. Bancorp</span>, <span class="companylink">SunTrust Banks</span> and <span class="companylink">BB&amp;T</span> rose after upgrades from Sandler O'Neill, following recent earnings reports, acquisitions and the exit from the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program for two of the companies. <span class="companylink">U.S. Bancorp</span> closed up 62 cents, or 2.7%, to 23.84; SunTrust gained 77 cents, or 4%, to 19.88; and <span class="companylink">BB&amp;T</span> rose 1.15, or 4.8%, to 25.06.</p>

Ford tacked on 58 cents, or 8.3%, to 7.58, as the car maker reported a third-quarter profit and said it would be "solidly profitable" in 2011 on cost cutting and a turnaround in its North American business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bucking the trend of recent weakness, health care was particularly strong. <span class="companylink">Human Genome Sciences</span> and <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> said their experimental drug Benlysta met the goal of a second late-stage study in treating lupus, increasing the drug's chances of becoming the first treatment in decades for the autoimmune disease. Human Genome (Nasdaq) closed up 6.59, or 35%, to 25.28, while <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> lost 45 cents, or 1.1%, to 40.71.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Varian Medical Systems</span> gained 2.20, or 5.4%, to 43.18, after the cancer-therapy-systems maker said it signed an agreement with Portugal's Instituto Portugues Oncologia, the state-run cancer hospital, to supply it with new radiosurgery and radiotherapy capabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drug developer <span class="companylink">Vertex Pharmaceuticals</span> (Nasdaq) increased 2.59, or 7.7%, to 36.15, after saying a Phase II study showed that twice-daily use of experimental hepatitis C treatment Telaprevir was comparable to three times a day. The dosing change could increase patient convenience and give a competitive advantage versus others developing therapies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fertilizer maker CF Industries Holdings overhauled its takeover bid for rival <span class="companylink">Terra Industries</span> with a new offer that is mostly cash and about $200 million higher.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perrigo (Nasdaq) gained 91 cents, or 2.5%, to 38.10, after posting a 61% increase in fiscal first-quarter earnings.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks took the scenic route to a higher close on Monday, fueled by upbeat economic data but bogged down along the way by fears about the recovery's staying power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After swinging in a 180-point range, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished with a 76.71-point gain, up 0.8%, at 9789.44, recouping nearly a third of the previous session's steep loss. The session continued a recent pattern of more volatile trading, including triple-digit point moves in six of the last eight sessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Tuesday's full-day move fell shy of 100-point territory, the blue-chip measure was up nearly 150 points at its morning high following the release of better-than-expected readings of U.S. manufacturing, construction, and pending home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those reports lessened but couldn't quite erase investors' recent nervousness about the sustainability of the U.S. economic rebound. Though veteran traders and analysts generally remain upbeat that the U.S. recession has ended, many worry that consumer spending and other key pieces of the economic puzzle may not improve for months to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're going to have to get used to this sort of choppy trading, I think," said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at <span class="companylink">Jefferies &amp; Co</span>. "We got so used to a steady march higher for awhile, but now we're seeing reminders that, yeah, there are reasons out there for a little volatility to come in sometimes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders said investor conviction in this year's market gains has gone wobbly in recent days, with many participants apt to sell quickly during rallies to book profits rather than wait for the next round of gains. At the same time, traders say a reserve of cash sidelined during last year's crash is still present, providing fuel for occasional bouts of bargain hunting whenever the market retreats significantly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other stock indexes swung between gains and losses Monday before finishing modestly higher. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 0.2%. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.7%, led by gains in its industrial, basic-materials, and consumer-staples sectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We went from buying dips to selling rallies here," said Frank Lesh, a broker at FuturePath Trading. "People are wondering whether they should just come out of equities entirely and put money into bonds at the year end."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial stocks were especially volatile Monday following the bankruptcy filing of troubled lender <span class="companylink">CIT Group</span>, which slid 65.3%. But the sector recovered late in the day, helped by gains for <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, <span class="companylink">Ford Motor</span> jumped 7% after it released better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and as the auto maker boosted its guidance for 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chicago Board Options Exchange's Volatility Index ended down 3% at 29.95. At its intraday high, it was up by the same percentage as investors bought options contracts to hedge against possible stock-market declines to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude-oil futures rose $1.09 to $78.09 a barrel. Treasury prices fell. The two-year note was down 1/32 to yield 0.917%. The 10-year note fell 6/32 to yield 3.411%.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks closed higher Monday on a day of wide swings, after a measure on manufacturing hit its best level in 3 1/2 years while pending home sales and construction spending in September both came in well above expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those reports, along with better-than-expected earnings and a forecast boost from <span class="companylink">Ford Motor</span>, encouraged buyers to return to stocks after a big drop Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended ahead 76.71 points, or 0.8%, at 9789.44. It jumped 146 points in the morning after the data were released, then swung into negative territory. But it regained much of the ground in the afternoon. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500-stock index climbed 0.7% to 1042.88. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.2% to 2049.2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We went from buying dips to selling rallies here,"said Frank Lesh, a broker at FuturePath Trading. "People are wondering whether they should just come out of equities entirely and put money into bonds at the year end."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ford was up 8.6% in late trade after it reported a third-quarter profit and said it would be "solidly profitable" in 2011 on cost cutting and a turnaround in its North American business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CIT Group</span> slid 63% after filing for bankruptcy protection Sunday, in a final attempt to restructure and keep the doors open at the century-old commercial lender. Shares will be suspended from New York Stock Exchange trading prior to Tuesday's opening, and they are likely to become worthless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Human Genome Sciences</span> surged 30% as it and <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline PLC</span> said their experimental drug Benlysta met the goal of a second late-stage study in treating lupus, increasing the drug's chances of becoming the first treatment in decades for the autoimmune disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Denbury Resources</span> fell 10% after agreeing to purchase Encore Acquisition in a $4.5 billion transaction that will create one of the largest independent oil exploration and production companies in North America. Encore jumped 20%. Denbury investors worried about the price of the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GTx slid 48% after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration didn't approve the company's bone-loss drug.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">YRC Worldwide</span> fell 66% as the trucking company announced details of an exchange offer for its note holders that would put the holders in control of 95% of the company's stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nymex crude futures rose $1.13 a barrel, or 1.5%, to $78.13.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks pushed higher Monday after a measure on manufacturing hit its best level in 3 1/2 years, while pending home sales and construction spending in September both came in well above expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reports, along with better-than-expected earnings and a forecast boost from <span class="companylink">Ford Motor</span>, encouraged buyers to return to stocks after a big drop Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In midday trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 97.85 points, or 1%, to 9810.68, recovering some of the ground lost in its 249-point slide Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500-stock index was up 0.6% to 1042.87, and the Nasdaq Composite Index was ahead 0.5% to 2054.76.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from the Institute for Supply Management showed the U.S. factory sector had its best month of expansion in October since April 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raw-materials companies were the leading gainers on the strong manufacturing news. DuPont and <span class="companylink">Alcoa</span> each climbed 1.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial firms also rose. Traders said part of the financial sector's gains came on relief that commercial lender <span class="companylink">CIT Group</span> finally filed for bankruptcy protection, a move that had been anticipated for months.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ford jumped 8.1% after it reported a third-quarter profit and said it would be "solidly profitable" in 2011.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MONSEY, N.Y. -- In his new suburban American home, Shaker Yakub, a Yemeni Jew, folded a large scarf in half, wrapped it around his head and tucked in his spiraling side curls. "This is how I passed for a Muslim," said the 59-year-old father of seven, improvising a turban that hid his black skullcap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ploy enabled Mr. Yakub and half a dozen members of his family to slip undetected out of their native town of Raida, Yemen, and travel to the capital 50 miles to the south. There, they met U.S. State Department officials conducting a clandestine operation to bring some of Yemen's last remaining Jews to America to escape rising anti-Semitic violence in his country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, about 60 Yemeni Jews have resettled in the U.S. since July; officials say another 100 could still come. There were an estimated 350 in Yemen before the operation began. Some of the remainder may go to Israel and some will stay behind, most in a government enclave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The secret evacuation of the Yemeni Jews -- considered by historians to be one of the oldest of the Jewish diaspora communities -- is a sign of America's growing concern about this Arabian Peninsula land of 23 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The operation followed a year of mounting harassment, and was plotted with Jewish relief groups while Washington was signaling alarm about Yemen. In July, Gen. David Petraeus was dispatched to Yemen to encourage President Ali Abdullah Saleh to be more aggressive against al-Qaeda terrorists in the country. Last month, President Barack Obama wrote in a letter to President Saleh that Yemen's security is vital to the region and the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yemen was overshadowed in recent years by bigger trouble spots such as Afghanistan. But it has re-emerged on Washington's radar as a potential source of regional instability and a haven for terrorists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impoverished nation is struggling with a Shiite revolt in the north, a secessionist movement in the south, and growing militancy among al-Qaeda sympathizers, raising concern about the government's ability to control its territory. Analysts believe al-Qaeda operatives are making alliances with local tribes that could enable it to establish a stronghold in Yemen, as it did in Afghanistan prior to the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The State Department took something of a risk in removing the Yemenis to the U.S., as it might be criticized for favoritism at a time when refugees elsewhere are clamoring for haven. The U.S. calculated the operation would serve both a humanitarian and a geopolitical purpose. In addition to rescuing a group threatened because of its religion, Washington was seeking to prevent an international embarrassment for an embattled Arab ally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Saleh has been trying to protect the Jews, but his inability to quell the rebellion in the country's north made it less likely he could do so, prompting the U.S. to step in. The alternative -- risking broader attacks on the Jews -- could well have undermined the Obama administration's efforts to rally support for President Saleh in the U.S. and abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we had not done anything, we feared there would be bloodshed," says Gregg Rickman, former State Department Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yakub says the operation saved his family from intimidation that had made life in Yemen unbearable. Violence toward the country's small remaining Jewish community began to intensify last year, when one of its most prominent members was gunned down outside his house. But the mission also hastens the demise of one of the oldest remaining Jewish communities in the Arab world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jews are believed to have reached what is now Yemen more than 2,500 years ago as traders for King Solomon. They survived -- and at times thrived -- over centuries of change, including the spread of Islam across the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They were one of the oldest exiled groups out of Israel," says Hayim Tawil, a Yeshiva University professor who is an expert on Yemeni Jewry. "This is the end of the Jewish Diaspora of Yemen. That's it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Centuries of near total isolation make Yemeni Jews a living link with the ancient world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many can recite passages of the Torah by heart and read Hebrew, but can't read their native tongue of Arabic. They live in stone houses, often without running water or electricity. One Yemeni woman showed up at the airport expecting to board her flight with a live chicken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the centuries, the Jews earned a living as merchants, craftsmen and silversmiths known for designing djanbias, traditional daggers that only Muslims are allowed to carry. Jewish musical compositions became part of Yemeni culture, played at Muslim weddings and festivals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Yemeni Jews have always been a part of Yemeni society and have lived side by side in peace with their Muslim brothers and sisters," said a spokeswoman for the Embassy of Yemen in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1947, on the eve of the birth of the state of Israel, protests in the port city of Aden resulted in the death of dozens of Jews and the destruction of their homes and shops. In 1949 and 1950 about 49,000 people -- the majority of Yemen's Jewish community -- were airlifted to Israel in "Operation Magic Carpet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 2,000 Jews stayed in Yemen. Some trickled out until 1962, when civil war erupted. After that, they were stuck there. "For three decades, there were no telephone calls, no letters, no traveling overseas. The fact there were Jews in Yemen was barely known outside Israel," says Prof. Tawil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After alienating the West by backing Iraq during the first Gulf War, Yemen sought a rapprochement with Washington. In 1991, it declared freedom of travel for Jews. An effort led by Prof. Tawil and brokered by the U.S. government culminated in the departure of about 1,200 Jews, mainly to Israel, in the early 1990s. Arthur Hughes, American ambassador to Yemen at the time, recalls that those who chose to remain insisted: "This is where we have been for centuries, we are okay; we're not going anywhere."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The few hundred Jews who stayed behind were concentrated in two enclaves: Saada, a remote area in Yemen's northern highlands, and Raida to the south.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, unrest erupted in Saada. The government says at least 50,000 people have been displaced by fighting between its troops and the Houthis, a Shiite rebel group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Animosity against Jews intensified. Notes nailed to the homes of Jews accused them of working for Israel and corrupting Muslim morals. "Jews were specifically targeted by Houthi rebels," says a spokeswoman for the Yemeni embassy in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January 2007, Houthi leaders threatened Jewish families in Saada. "We warn you to leave the area immediately... [W]e give you a period of 10 days, or you will regret it," read a letter signed by a Houthi representative cited in a Reuters article.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virtually the entire Jewish community in the area, about 60 people, fled to the capital. Since then, they have been receiving food stipends and cash assistance from the government while living in state-owned apartments in a guarded enclave, says the Yemeni embassy in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Saleh, a Shiite, has been eager to demonstrate goodwill toward the Jews. On the Passover holiday, he invited TV crews to videotape families in the government complex as they feasted on lamb he had ordered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raida became the last redoubt of Yemeni Jews, who continued to lead a simple life there alongside Muslims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ancient stone homes dot the town. Electricity is erratic; oil lamps are common. Water arrives via truck. Most homes lack a TV or a refrigerator. The cell phone is the only common modern device. Some families receive financial aid from Hasidic Jewish groups in Brooklyn and London, which has enabled them to buy cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, the Jewish men are blacksmiths, shoe repairmen or carpenters. They sometimes barter, trading milk and cow dung for grass to feed their livestock. In public, the men stand out for their long side curls, customarily worn by observant Jewish men. Jewish women, who often marry by 16, rarely leave home. When they do, like Muslim women, only their eyes are exposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For fun, children play with pebbles and chase family chickens around the house. At Jewish religious schools, they sit at wooden tables to study Torah and Hebrew. They aren't taught subjects like science, or to read and write in Arabic, Yemen's official language.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I showed them a multiplication table and I don't think they had ever seen one," says Stefan Kirschner, a New York University graduate student who visited Raida in August 2008 and says he sat in a few classes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September 2008, militants detonated a car bomb outside the U.S. Embassy in Yemen's capital of Sanaa, killing 16 people. The attack raised fresh concern about Muslim extremism and the government's stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, on Dec. 11, a lone gunman shot dead Moshe Nahari, a father of nine and well-known figure in Raida's Jewish community. Abdul-Aziz al-Abdi, a retired Air Force pilot, pumped several bullets into Mr. Nahari after the Hebrew teacher dismissed his demands that he convert to Islam. In June, the shooter was sentenced to death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Israel's offensive against Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip later in December sparked protests in Yemen. Jewish men and children in Raida were heckled, beaten and pelted with rocks. A grenade was hurled at the house of Said Ben Yisrael, who led one of three makeshift synagogues in Raida, and landed in the courtyard of his two-story home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the safety of his new home in suburban New York, Mr. Yakub recounted his last months in Yemen. Rocks shattered the windows of his house and car. Except for emergencies and provisions, Jews began to avoid leaving home. When they did, Mr. Yakub and other Jews took to disguising themselves as Muslims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This was no way to live," he said, seated at the head of a long table surrounded by his wife and children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Salem Suleiman, who also arrived recently in New York, bears scars from rocks that hit his head. "They throw stones at us. They curse us. They want to kill us," he said. "I didn't leave my house for two months."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York had a community of about 2,000 Yemeni Jews. Yair Yaish, who heads the Yemenite Jewish Federation of America, says he was barraged with "desperate calls from the community here saying we have to do something to get our families out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Ambassador to Yemen urged Yemeni ministers to facilitate the departure. After initial reluctance -- the government preferred to give the Jews safe haven in the capital city -- Yemen agreed to issue exit permits and passports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was the embassy's view, and the Department concurred, that because of their vulnerability, we should consider them for resettlement," says a spokeswoman for the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jewish Federations of North America raised $750,000 to help the effort. Orthodox groups also pledged to pitch in. The Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society was tasked with their resettlement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Word reached Jews in Raida that there was an American plan afoot to rescue them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first applicants signed up at the U.S. Embassy in January. To avoid attracting attention, families convoyed to Sanaa in taxis at dawn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later they traveled to a hotel for interviews with U.S. officials. To establish a case for refugee status, they had to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution. For many of the women, it was the first time speaking with anyone outside the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As news spread of their imminent departure, many families reported trouble selling property. Potential buyers offered low prices or refused to bid, thinking they could get the property free after it was deserted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All they have is this little house worth $15,000," says Yochi Sabari, a Jew from Raida who lives in New York and has relatives in Yemen. "They can't leave until they sell it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About three weeks before their travel date, the U.S. embassy contacted the first four families cleared for travel. On July 7, their 17 members traveled to the airport in Sanaa and boarded a Frankfurt-bound flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Yemenis landed in New York the next day, Jewish organization officials there to greet them spotted several women cloaked in black robes, only their eyes exposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Jewish women were the ones in burqas," says Gideon Aronoff, president of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. He says he was "initially shocked."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several families missed the two flights offered to them by the U.S. and, therefore, forfeited their chance to move here. Family members say they are having trouble disposing of assets. An undisclosed number of people have reached Israel, including the family of Mr. Ben Yisrael, whose home was the target of a grenade, and the family of Mr. Nahari, who was slain in December 2008. In the U.S., the Yemeni refugees are being settled in Monsey, a suburban enclave of ultraorthodox Jews, lined with strip malls that sell black coats and wide-rimmed hats worn by Hasidic men.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society's network established a Monsey office, where case managers arrange housing and disburse food stamps, cash and other refugee benefits to the Yemeni arrivals. Many of the adults, caseworkers say, aren't yet capable of budgeting, following a schedule or sitting still in a structured classroom to learn English.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent morning, Mr. Suleiman, a 36-year-old father of three, retrieved an alarm clock that he received with his furnished apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I still don't know how to use this," he said. "The children have been playing with it."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nancy Keates </div><div>982 words</div><div>30 October 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>W8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hard sell has hit high-end ski areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"ANOTHER PRICE REDUCTION!" shrieked a recent email to Aspen, Colo., real-estate agents in bold red 48-point font, advertising the fact that a large home in the exclusive community of Starwood was now asking $9.95 million, 38% less than its original $15.95 million asking price. "CONTRARY TO RUMORS, 101 STEIN IS NOT UNDER CONTRACT!" screamed another, in lime-green size 24 font, about a ski-in, ski-out townhouse now asking $4.8 million, down from $7.4 million. But the biggest shocker, says Aspen broker Pamala Steadman, was the email reporting the markdown of a mansion on Red Mountain -- a prestigious area of a prestigious town -- to $19.9 million from $28 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fall has long been considered a good time to hunt for good ski deals, from season passes to condominium rentals. But this year, the biggest discounting isn't just on lift tickets and goggles; it's on custom-built homes with views and slopeside condos with Jacuzzi tubs. "This is really unheard of," says Ms. Steadman. "Sellers are finally getting desperate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the rest of the luxury real-estate market, elite ski areas initially held up better at the beginning of the housing downturn, seemingly immune from the rash of foreclosures sweeping across less-affluent communities. That was even more true at ski resorts, where land use restrictions limit inventory and buyers are often less reliant on credit. For a while, sellers just took their homes off the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this summer the high-end finally hit a wall, because of the lack of financing for large "jumbo" mortgages as well as the fact that federal rescue measures only applied to lower-priced properties. According to the National Association of Realtors, sales of homes over $1 million fell 1.2% in September from a year earlier. The crunch was then exacerbated at ski resorts, where a number of projects begun before the housing bust have just been completed, says Rod Slifer, principal of Slifer Smith &amp;Frampton Real Estate in Vail, Colo. "That's put extra pressure on prices," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Sun Valley, Idaho, a favorite spot for CEOs, a 12,000-square-foot home on 10 acres with a guest house and six-stall barn was reduced for the second time this month to $7.9 million, more than half off its original asking price of $17.9 million. Nearby, a newer six-bedroom home on 2.5 acres is at $6.5 million, down from $8.5 million. "Prices are much lower now," says Suzanne Williams, an agent in Ketchum, Idaho. According to the Sawtooth Board of Realtors MLS statistics, for September 2009 there were 14 home sales with a median price of $465,000 compared to 20 sales with a median price of $830,000 in September 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices also fell sharply this summer in Jackson Hole, Wyo., known for its steep slopes and rugged feel. According to the Teton Board of Realtors MLS, nine homes sold with a median price of $800,000 this past September, compared to 12 sales and a median price of $1.3 million in September 2008 and 19 sales and a median price of $1.04 million in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Park City, Utah, a popular destination with a mix of high and moderately priced homes, has shown some signs of stabilization. The number of homes sold as of August of this year was the same, 50, as it was by August 2008, an improvement over the winter. But pricey Upper Deer Valley is still struggling. "I'm willing to go another year," says Craig Mogel, a developer in Deer Valley who initially listed a home he built at $9.95 million in the fall of 2007 and reduced the price by $1 million a year later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowhere is the fire sale hotter than in Aspen, where four homes were sold in September of 2009 with a total value of $24.2 million, down from 11 homes sold in September 2007 with a total value of $71.8 million, according to MLS statistics from the Aspen Board of Realtors. "There are unbelievable bargains now," says Carol Dopkin, of Carol Dopkin Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dopkin is representing the house in Starwood that's down to $9.95 million. It is a top-to-bottom eight-year renovation of a 9,900-square-foot, seven-bedroom home on six acres with a four-stall barn and a guest house. Owner Debi Roblin Cook, who lives in Hawaii, says the current price is less than the amount she and her recently deceased husband put into the redo. "There's been some interest, but it's like people almost want you to give it away," she says, declining to say whether she would further reduce the price if the home fails to sell. She says she did get an offer a few years ago for $16 million which she now regrets rejecting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some agents think the market will pick up in the winter, traditionally high season. Developer and real-estate agent Sallie Golden and her partner finished a 6,000-square-foot home on 910 W. North St. in Aspen's West End in September. When the property sat unsold at $10 million, she dropped the price to $6.8 million. She received three serious offers and finally closed on a deal last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the emails directed to brokers (and their clients) keep on coming. In October a brand new, four-bedroom, four-bathroom condo in the heart of Aspen originally at $8 million fell to $5.5 million. "PRICE REDUCTION!" the 24-point font bellowed. "FURNISHED!"</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billionaire's Ex-Wife Asks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$100 Million for Estate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virginia winemaker and philanthropist Patricia Kluge is offering her 300-acre English country estate in Charlottesville, Va., for $100 million, one of the most expensive listings in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kluge, 61 years old, is the former wife of John Kluge, a billionaire who founded the Metromedia broadcast and cellphone empire. Her estate, in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains near Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, includes a 45-room neo-Georgian main house of 23,538 square feet with eight bedrooms and 13 baths. Completed in 1985, the home has a theater, library, recreation room with spa and sauna, a card room and an Islamic gallery featuring an antique Syrian fountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property includes a pool, pool house, log cabin, a greenhouse and several staff cottages. There are three stocked ponds, gardens, and a croquet lawn. The front grounds can be converted to an 18-hole golf course, for which designs by Arnold Palmer exist. Ms. Kluge also runs a Virginia winery that bears her name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the most expensive listings is the Los Angeles mansion of Candy Spelling, the widow of television producer Aaron Spelling, who is asking $150 million. Michael Rankin of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> has the Kluge listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Curator's French Riviera</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The widow of William Rubin, who is credited with playing a crucial role in shaping the collections of New York's Museum of Modern Art, has listed a 13-acre estate in the south of France for 6.15 million euros (about $9 million). Mr. Rubin, who died in 2006, was MOMA's chief curator of painting and sculpture from 1968 to 1988. Among the influential exhibitions Mr. Rubin organized was a 1980 Picasso retrospective that filled the entire museum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hillside estate of Phyllis Hattis of New York, Mr. Rubin's widow, is about 12 miles northwest of Saint-Tropez and overlooks the village of Plan-de-la-Tour, where actor Johnny Depp has a house. The 6,450-square-foot stone house, designed by Mr. Rubin, has seven bedrooms and six bathrooms. There's a guest house, a caretaker's house, a heated outdoor pool, a greenhouse with a smaller indoor pool and a one-acre vineyard. The home was expanded and updated in 1996. Eric Legastelois of Legastelois Immobilier has the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> Ex-Official</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cuts Gwathmey Co-Op Price</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former Bear Stearns chief operating officer Alvin H. Einbender, 80, has cut the price of his Manhattan apartment, a onetime gym in the former New York City Police Headquarters downtown, and is now asking $19.95 million, 33% off the original listing price in May 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of the 6,600-square-foot cooperative unit was cut once before, last March, to $26 million. It has an 80-by-40 foot great room with a 25-foot ceiling featuring large skylights. The late architect Charles Gwathmey designed the four-bedroom, four-bath apartment for Mr. Einbender and his wife, Joan. (Mr. Gwathmey also designed an addition to the Guggenheim Museum.) Mr. Einbender left the operating-chief post at Bear in 1992. Sharon E. Baum of <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span> has the listing.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Crude Oil Descends Below $78; Hurt by Rising Gasoline Stocks, Dollar; Rice Gets Soaked</span>
</div><div class="author">By Claire Rangel   </div><div>612 words</div><div>29 October 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>C7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude-oil futures dropped to a two-week low under $78 a barrel Wednesday on an unexpected rise in U.S. gasoline stocks and further strengthening in the dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Light, sweet crude for December delivery settled $2.09, or 2.6%, lower at $77.46 a barrel on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>. This was the lowest level since the Oct. 14 settlement of $75.18 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gasoline inventories registered a surprise gain of 1.619 million barrels last week, ending two consecutive week of draws, data released Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Energy showed. Analysts surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a 1.1 million-barrel decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil's run-up to $82 a barrel last week was partly triggered by worries over falling gasoline stocks amid low refinery operating rates, but the latest figures pushed those concerns aside. Refiners marginally increased processing rates by 0.7% to 81.8% of total operating capacity, although they remain below long-term averages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude stocks rose 778,000 barrels, below forecasts for a 1.7 million-barrel rise, while there was a larger-than-anticipated drop in stocks of distillates, including diesel and heating oil, which fell by 2.134 million barrels. This decline, however, was in line with seasonal trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low profitability is cutting refiners' demand for crude, said Brad Samples, an analyst with Summit Energy in Louisville, Ky. "Until we can continue to reduce the current oversupply of products, there's no great reason for crude to make a lasting move above $80 or $90 a barrel."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compounding oil's move lower was the dollar hitting its highest level against the euro in over two weeks. Oil is priced world-wide in dollars, so crude prices tend to fall if the greenback strengthens against other currencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors also appeared to be concerned by disappointing economic data reports this week, leading a flight away from the so-called riskier and higher-yielding assets of oil and equities, and into the safe haven of the dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported early Wednesday that single-family home sales in September fell by 3.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 402,000 compared to the previous month, breaking a string of five consecutive increases. The data cemented concerns about shaky consumer confidence due to rising unemployment and tight credit conditions in the U.S. that could delay the economic recovery and a revival of demand for crude and oil products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third-quarter U.S. gross-domestic-product figures due out at 8:30 a.m. EDT Thursday will be watched closely by oil-market participants for confirmation that the U.S. has emerged from the recession. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expect that GDP grew at an annual rate of 3.2% in the third quarter after it contracted for three quarters in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other commodity news:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RICE: Chicago Board of Trade rice rose sharply amid heavy rains threatening to again thwart the harvest in Arkansas, the top rice-producing U.S. state and concerns about supplies in Asia. November rice ended up 41 cents to $13.9150 per hundred pounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COPPER: Weaker equities, another uptick in the U.S. dollar and a disappointing report on U.S. new-home sales sent copper futures to their third consecutive lower close on Wednesday. Most-active December copper fell 6.85 cents to settle at $2.9305 per pound on the Comex division of the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>.</p>

</div><div class="author">By M.P. McQueen  </div><div>1145 words</div><div>29 October 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who refrained from splurging on big home-improvement projects during the housing boom are reaping the rewards now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Depending on the region and the job, some homeowners are paying as much as 20% less for home-remodeling projects than they would have a few years ago. Many contractors are willing to accept smaller jobs and "handyman" projects that they used to snub. And more projects are being delivered on time and on budget -- a stark contrast from the boom years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kim and Chandra Sobieski of Cat Spring, Texas, considered expanding their home two years ago, but thought the contractor's $380,000 estimate was too high. Earlier this year, Mr. Sobieski, a 54-year-old retired title-company executive, called the same contractor and got a quote for a slightly revised expansion for 20% less. The couple wound up paying $300,000 to add 1,500 square feet to their old 3,400-square-foot home, including installing a new roof, converting a garage to an entertainment room and adding a new garage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We caught them at a time there was more downtime, and it seemed to work to our advantage," says Mr. Sobieski, who adds that the project was finished ahead of schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sobieskis' contractor agrees that timing made the difference. "Three years ago, if you asked someone for a discount, they'd laugh at you," says Jeff Hunt, vice president of Brothers Strong, the Houston firm that did the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remodeling prices are down an average 5% to 10% across the U.S. from their peak, firms say, largely due to bidding wars among contractors idled by the housing slump and lower costs for some materials, such as plywood, lumber and insulation, because of lower global demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The remodeling industry has also been hurt by sluggish sales of new and existing homes; most remodeling is done within 18 to 24 months of the purchase of a home, studies indicate. Tighter credit and falling home values also hurt the industry, as many big jobs are financed with home-equity loans or other borrowing. Some new-home builders are now competing for home remodeling jobs, helping to force down prices even more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the year ended the first quarter of 2009, the most recent data available, $118.2 billion was spent on home-improvement projects, down from $146 billion in the year ended the third quarter of 2007 -- the national peak of remodeling activity -- according to a report issued this month by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. The center said it expected spending declines to moderate through the end of this year and begin to rise early next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, there are still remodelers who aren't cutting prices drastically. Building materials represent only about one-third of their costs, and taxes and insurance premiums, including workers' compensation, have continued to rise. Fuel prices also remain high, and prices for some petroleum-based building products, such as asphalt shingles, rose in 2007 and 2008, although that trend started to reverse last spring, according to the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some contractors bristle at homeowners who demand deep discounts. "Why are you asking if you can get a $300,000 project for $175,000 when nothing has changed except that you can't get financing for it?" asks William Carter, president of the National Association of the Remodeling Industry and a certified kitchen and bath remodeler in Sacramento, Calif. He acknowledges that he has lost several jobs because he refused to lower his fees by more than 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lowest bidders don't necessarily offer the best value, Mr. Carter says. Some bid too low and then can't finish the job at the quoted price, leading them to cut corners, ask for more money or even abandon the job. Some are moonlighting amateurs or otherwise unqualified, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local Better Business Bureaus typically receive thousands of complaints every year about construction and remodeling contractors, says Alison Southwick, a spokeswoman for the national Council of Better Business Bureaus Inc. in Arlington, Va. Homeowners should get multiple bids and ask to see several recent examples of builder's completed work and talk to previous clients before signing a contract, she says. (You can find reliability reports for local contractors at www.bbb.org[http://www.bbb.org].)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some established contractors who specialize in renovations are skeptical of moves by new-home builders to seek remodeling jobs. Remodeling contractors contend builders often win jobs by bidding low, but their estimates are based on their experience erecting houses on vacant lots, not working in homes with decades-old wiring occupied by arguing couples and wandering pets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can't do a $100,000 project for $69,000, but they don't realize it until they are two-thirds through," says Rocco Sinisgalli, president of Oneida Builders in Dunwoody, Ga., a remodeling firm that faces increasing competition from local homebuilders. Remodeling prices in his area are down about 10% to 12% from 2006, says Mr. Sinisgalli, who also runs a course in remodeling for home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Crowe, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders, confirms that more home builders are seeking remodeling work, and that remodeling contractors -- who are also represented by the organization -- were concerned about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it's possible that the smaller builder that has not done remodeling in the past could be mistaken in the amount of effort it takes to remodel an existing structure," Mr. Crowe says. "But I don't think that is widespread."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michelle Aube, 42, says she and her husband relied on a custom new-home builder to redo their 3,000-square-foot house in Fairfield, Conn. in 2007, and the project took much longer than the builder said it would take. She says the builder seemed unfamiliar with the tribulations of renovating an occupied house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I chose him because out of three contractors he gave me the best bid," Ms. Aube, a homemaker, says of the $200,000 remodel and expansion. "It was supposed to be a six-month job, and it ran into a nine- or 10-month job," she says, but it was "worth it in the end."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other homeowners have gotten deals from established remodeling specialists because of the tough economy. Jessica Levy Buchman, a 39-year-old executive at a real-estate brokerage, estimates she saved 20% to 25% off prerecession prices when she and her husband renovated a house they bought in December in Sag Harbor, N.Y. Some roofers wanted $7,000 for a repair job. She paid $1,500, which wasn't even the lowest bid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Says Ms. Buchman, "I feel we are getting rewarded for riding it out and having the guts to spend a little money."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales in the U.S. unexpectedly fell in September following five consecutive increases -- and the August figure was revised lower -- as tighter credit and unemployment fears kept buyers away from the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, orders climbed for long-lasting goods during September, the fourth increase in six months, while a key gauge of capital spending rose strongly, a favorable sign for U.S. manufacturing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home sales fell by 3.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 402,000 compared with the prior month, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expected September sales to rise 2.6% to 440,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the recent stabilization in the housing market -- formerly at the root of the worst recession since the Great Depression -- is expected to have helped the U.S. economy return to growth in the third quarter. Gross domestic product data for the July-to-September period is due Thursday morning, and analysts predict it will show 3.2% growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories shrank in September. Excess supply has caused house prices to fall over the past couple of years. The median price of $204,800 in September was down 9.1% from the year-earlier level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The steep drop in prices has lured some buyers back this year, as have low interest rates. But a jobless rate of nearly 10% is keeping others away from the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales bottomed in January and are up 22.2% since the nadir, when the economy was in the depth of the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, oil-rich Norway became the first European country to raise interest rates after the financial crisis, lifting the key borrowing rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 1.5% in response to signs of renewed economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norway's central bank also raised its interest-rate path projections, which signaled rates will edge gradually up to 2.75% by the end of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norway has pulled out of recession faster than the rest of Europe, helped by the strong rise in commodity prices since the start of the year, as well as significant monetary and fiscal-policy stimulus. The stimulus programs amounted to more than 4% of gross domestic product in 2009.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">W. Michael Brown has scaled back hiring plans in his Virginia auto-parts stores. Carl Redman halted an expansion project at his Oregon contracting business. Bill Hammack is preparing layoffs at his road-construction company in Georgia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy remains unsteady 22 months after the recession began, with banks restricting credit and consumers hunkering down. For these small businesses, and many others across the country, there's an additional dark cloud: uncertainty created by Washington's bid to reorganize a wide swath of the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic contraction is of course the prime force driving companies to lay off workers. But a health-care overhaul grinding through Congress could bring unknown new obligations to insure employees. Bush-era tax cuts are set to end next year, and their fate is unclear. Legislation aimed at tackling climate change might raise businesses' energy costs. Meanwhile, a bill aimed at increasing transportation spending is stalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many companies say they have responded by freezing hiring, cutting benefits and delaying expansion plans. With at least 60% of job growth historically coming out of the small-business sector, according to the government's Small Business Administration, that kind of inertia could impede an economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, 7.2 million jobs have been lost during the recession, and forecasts show little or no job growth expected for the rest of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brown wants to expand Olympus Imported Auto Parts, his 32-year-old business, by adding two stores to his four in northern Virginia. But instead of staffing his new stores with the same number of employees as the older ones -- which would mean 40 new jobs -- he's expecting to hire only 15 people. He'll likely transfer some current workers to new stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His business, selling auto parts, has been fine during the recession, he said. "Historically we've been a recession-proof industry," he said, since people are more likely to repair vehicles than buy new ones in tough economic times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He cut overtime for many of his 150 employees in anticipation of facing fresh health-care costs. He's worried about getting hit by higher taxes next year, which would cut into income to pay for expansion, raises, bonuses, new product lines and delivery trucks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Company owners have passionate positions on each of these issues, but mostly they say they want more certainty about future costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's so much trepidation out there," said Mr. Brown. "The thing I'm struggling with is how the potential government takeover of health care coupled with impending taxes will impact my company."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One likely health-care proposal suggests imposing a per-employee fee on companies that have more than 50 workers and don't provide coverage. Mr. Brown currently provides Blue Cross coverage for his employees. He pays 75% of the premium for single employees and 50% for family coverage. With a fight expected over the bill that just passed the Senate Finance Committee, it is unclear how he will be affected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employment data released this month showed worse-than-expected job losses. According to a National Federation of Independent Business survey, 16% of small business owners said they plan to cut staff or not fill vacancies, a three-percentage-point increase over August. Only 7% said they planned to create new jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey concludes that more business owners are planning to contract than expand. In August, businesses were split equally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is little reliable data explaining why companies are retrenching despite signs of life in the economy, including recent increases in production in some industries and rises in housing prices and new home sales. However, a variety of organizations that monitor business behavior, including the NFIB, the Associated General Contractors of America and the National Small Business Association, say political uncertainty is a substantial factor, alongside other more typical problems, such as availability of credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No question, this is a tough issue for a lot of these companies," said David Wyss, chief economist at ratings firm <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>. "It's all anecdotal, and it affects everybody differently, but the one common factor is people postpone decisions, and I'm afraid that's going to slow us down coming out of the recession."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wyss said the resulting lack of hiring is one reason he's forecasting just 1.5% growth in the economy for 2010. "It's better than going down but it's not going to be fun."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Academic economists have long noted a link between economic growth and the political environment. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, in his 1979 Ph.D. thesis, wrote that "increased uncertainty provides an incentive to defer...investments in order to wait for new information."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wharton School of Business Professor Raffi Amit cites the Obama administration's pending overhaul of banking regulations as another drag. He said it will likely require banks to hold more money in reserve, potentially reducing the pool of funds available to make loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That combines with uncertainty about other issues, he said. "Obviously people are worried about what health-care costs are going to be. Nobody knows. Taxes, who knows?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rep. Mike Coffman (R., Colo.), a member of the House Small Business Committee, said he hears most often from small-business owners about the financial obligations they will face because of taxes and health care. The transportation appropriations bill is another issue, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think there is a lot of cash on the sidelines that isn't going to come until Washington" makes some decisions, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rep. Nydia Velazquez (D. N.Y.), chairwoman of the House Small Business Committee, said Congress has endeavored to take into account small businesses as it works on health care, climate change and financial regulation. She acknowledged the need for certainty in a recent hearing about the pending expiration of a tax break for first-time homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Small firms want to see these matters addressed so they know what the rules are, can make informed decisions and plan for the future," she said in a written statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The White House referred calls to the Small Business Administration. SBA spokesman Jonathan Swain said officials there "haven't heard the specific concern" over uncertainty out of Washington. "Of course, we do know it's not been an easy year for small business." He said the agency has been working to help small businesses, which are key to the economic recovery, since they employ more than half of the workers in the U.S. Last week, the Obama administration said it would try to shift its bailout funds towards local banks that would in turn provide financing for small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses are generally defined as companies with fewer than 500 employees. However, the designation varies in different sectors and industries, with the number of employees and revenue factored in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Redman, vice president of Bear Electric Inc. of Donald, Ore., said he'd rather be expanding his operation during a recession, with prices for things such as land, equipment and construction likely more affordable. He's also thought about adding to his 90-person staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We'd love to step out on the limb and hire more people just to get more folks working, but things are so frightening, and number one on that list is health care," he said. "Second is taxes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In past downturns, Mr. Redman said, he tried to expand his electrical-contracting business. This time, his company had plans drawn up by a local architect for a 10,000-square-foot addition to the warehouse where it maintains its inventory. Having more inventory on hand means he could handle more jobs quickly without waiting for supplies to come in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The design had been approved by the city. A contract and construction were next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We pulled the plug," he said. "I made the decision based on all the unknowns. I didn't think it would be wise to make the expenditure because I don't know if I will need the money to pay for something else."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Redman also shelved trying to use the federal "cash for clunkers" program to buy new vehicles, in part because the health-care debate was at full boil. "In a recession, you want to spend cash to get out of the recession. But with this sword hanging over my head, I'm afraid to use my resources to buy more equipment or hire more people."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often lost in the furor over health care is a transportation-appropriations law that was set to expire last month, leaving in limbo a six-year, $450 billion spending plan for highway construction, mass transit and other projects, as well as an additional $50 billion for high-speed rail. At the last minute, Congress extended the bill for one more month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But without a reauthorization bill to replace the existing law, transportation funding remains at current levels for an indefinite period. That has made states and companies reluctant to start new, long-term projects until they know how much the future funding will be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hammack, president of C.W. Matthews Contracting Co., one of the largest road-construction companies in Georgia, said the ripple effect of the delay has already reached firms like his. His company had already laid off 700 of its 2,000 employees since 2007 because of the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the delay in passage of the transportation-bill reauthorization and the dearth of state contracts means he's planning to lay off as many as 200 more employees by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can't proceed under business as normal when there's no clear direction out there," he said. "It's too dangerous to bet on the future and put your company in financial jeopardy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the Obama administration's $787 billion stimulus package, while a positive shot, hasn't provided long-term help for heavy-construction companies such as his. "The stimulus package, at least as it relates to Georgia, isn't putting the heavy equipment to work that moves dirt," he said. "It's been asphalt work. It's not a sustainable cure for what ails the transportation industry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Campbell, executive vice president of <span class="companylink">Wheeler Machinery Co</span>., a Caterpillar dealer in Salt Lake City, said Utah's contract work has ground to a standstill as well. "There's a trickledown when you mess with infrastructure," he said. "It has a freezing effect on everything." At his firm, this has meant 221 layoffs. He is considering more among the 629 employees left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's very little private money going into any kind of construction," Mr. Campbell said. "You take the federal contracts out of that and it gets a whole lot worse really quick."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sandy Abalos, of Abalos &amp; Associates PLLC in Phoenix, is cutting benefits at her certified public accountant firm. She still pays 100% of health-care coverage for her 16 employees, but stopped making 401k contributions. She also stopped profit-sharing, a recent step to hold some cash in reserve in case health-care costs and taxes rise. She is trying to maintain staffing levels and leave salaries alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These are people who have worked with me for 15 years. They're like family," she said. "I've told everybody there will not be bonuses, so they can plan their own financial life. Everybody has had to pull back."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes surged 9.4% in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.57 million units, as lower prices and the looming expiration of a federal tax credit lured more buyers into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data, released Friday by the National Association of Realtors, portrayed a housing market that continues to stabilize across the country and gives ammunition to those trying to extend the $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospects for extending the credit remain mixed. On Capitol Hill, there are deep concerns about the program's cost. While many lawmakers support some form of extension, they want the credit's substantial cost to be offset by tax increases or spending cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extending the current credit would cost about $1 billion a month, according to congressional estimates. Some lawmakers are backing an expanded credit that would last through June and cost about $16.7 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada has been trying to reach an agreement for a 13-month extension that would provide up to the full $8,000 for four months, and gradually reduce the credit's value over the remainder of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aides say Mr. Reid aims to have a vote on the measure as part of next week's debate over extending federal unemployment insurance benefits. The package also is likely to include bigger tax refunds for businesses that have suffered operating losses during the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new sales data could help backers of the credit, scheduled to expire Nov. 30. But the improvement also could undercut a key argument of backers -- that the recovery remains fragile enough to require an extension. It also doesn't alleviate concerns the credit has been subject to widespread abuse, as the Internal Revenue Service pursues more than 100,000 suspected improper claims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing homes sales were up across the country, the NAR reported. The median price of an existing home has fallen 8.5% year-over-year, but prices have stabilized from their free-fall during the worst months of the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spike in demand reduced housing inventories to a two-year low. Housing inventory was down 7.5% to 3.63 million homes in September, reducing the nation's housing supply to 7.8 months from 9.3 months in August, assuming the current sales pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is still in rough shape: The supply of homes is still about three months bigger than normal, and distressed sales, such as foreclosure auctions, continue to drag down prices. But many analysts say the broad rebound in sales shows the market is being driven by more than first-time buyers lured by the tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam Khater, senior economist for First American CoreLogic Inc., said sales would likely decline only marginally if the tax credit were allowed to expire. He argued that other programs of the Federal Reserve and Federal Housing Administration have played a larger role in luring buyers.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes was an only child, dying in 1976 with no will or children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hughes's estate now has more than 1,000 heirs and beneficiaries who are hoping for one last, big payout from a swath of Las Vegas land bought by the tycoon in the 1940s to establish an inland base for his aerospace operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are likely to get little. The housing bust has shriveled the value of the 2,800 hectares left in what is now called the Summerlin development in Las Vegas, once thought to be worth as much as $2 billion. The property also has gotten bogged down in the bankruptcy of <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties Inc</span>., which was supposed to make a final payment to the Hughes group early next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's terrible disappointment," says Platt Davis, a retired lawyer in Houston and second cousin of Mr. Hughes who leads the group of heirs along with two other beneficiaries, David Lummis and David Elkins. The 2010 payment is supposed to be equal to half the appraised value of the remaining land at the end of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Summerlin represents the last chapter of the Hughes-estate saga, which is almost as extraordinary as the life of the aviator, film director and entrepreneur who founded <span class="companylink">Hughes Aircraft Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Hughes died, his holdings encompassed 26 companies that included seven Las Vegas casinos, a struggling helicopter maker, several aircraft, a television station, a private airport, a regional airline, mining claims and a bag of casino chips he neglected to redeem. Summerlin was then 9,100 undeveloped hectares of desert and scrub.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Mr. Hughes had no will or children, his estate was divided among relatives. Law firms and other professionals that did the initial work to sort out the estate and fix up some assets for disposition accepted small shares of the proceeds as payment for their services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of claimants and their beneficiaries has grown to more than 1,000 people. They so far have collected more than $1.5 billion from the liquidation of his estate, according to the group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The heirs include schoolteachers, ministers, college professors, homemakers, architects, a federal judge and a rancher. Catherine Russell received her share of Mr. Hughes's estate in her 1986 divorce from her husband, a lawyer whose firm did work for the Hughes heirs. The money she received every year amounted to at least a few thousand dollars but never more than half her annual salary, helping to cover college for her son and daughter and medical costs after a drunken driver hit her in 1989.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Russell, a deputy commissioner in California's Department of Real Estate, also steered yearly proceeds toward the care of her son, now 38 years old and mentally disabled because of a 1994 motorcycle accident. She planned to use the final Summerlin payout to establish a trust for her son and put a deposit on a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that the payment is on hold with General Growth's other debts and obligations, Ms. Russell describes her situation as "very disconcerting and depressing." While many people assume that all of the beneficiaries of the Hughes estate are rich, she says, "it is very depressing to be 60 years old and no longer be able to afford a piece of property and to pass something on to my children, especially considering my son's disability."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Growth, owner of more than 200 U.S. shopping malls, says it wants to resolve the Hughes claim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The company is optimistic that a fair resolution will be reached with the Hughes heirs, as with all of our stakeholders, as we proceed through the process of emergence from bankruptcy," President and Chief Operating Officer Tom Nolan says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hughes bought the Las Vegas land because he was concerned that the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 had exposed the vulnerability of the aircraft industry along coastal California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the mid-1990s, the area was hot real estate. In 1996, the Hughes group agreed to sell the property to Rouse Co., a large developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the negotiations, Rouse and the Hughes group couldn't agree on a purchase price because so much of Summerlin had yet to be developed. Instead, they formulated a profit-sharing agreement, in which the heirs would receive half of each year's profits from sales of Summerlin land to home builders over 14 years. And instead of cash, the heirs decided to receive payments in stock, which helped them defer taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those payments amounted to roughly $570 million in stock as Summerlin was developed. Roughly 95,000 people live there now. But land values have fallen so drastically in Las Vegas that the Summerlin claim might now be worth less than $100 million, says analyst Kevin Starke of CRT Group LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One other problem facing the Hughes group: General Growth bought Rouse in 2004, inheriting the pact with the heirs. In April, the mall owner sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the Hughes group must get in line with other creditors, submitting a claim to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper next month. Stuck in the pecking order with shareholders, Mr. Hughes's heirs and beneficiaries get nothing unless General Growth's lenders and debt holders recoup the full amounts of their claims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the process, General Growth and the Hughes group will need to decide whether to keep the old deal, revise it or strike a new one subject to the judge's approval.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Saunders   </div><div>897 words</div><div>23 October 2009</div><div>16:45</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(See Corrections &amp; Amplifications item below.)[U10219929650FQF]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people hope the federal estate tax will disappear next year, as scheduled. They could be sorry if it does.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 2000, Congress enacted a gradual loosening of the estate exemption. It has since risen to its current level of $3.5 million per individual, or up to $7 million per couple. The tax is scheduled to lapse just for next year and return in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington insiders are betting lawmakers won't let that happen. Instead they believe Congress is likely to act before the end of this year to extend the current system through next year. And perhaps they should, because getting rid of the estate tax actually would cause problems for most taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At issue is the "step-up in cost basis" that all assets receive when an owner dies. The way the law is currently written, if the estate tax goes away, so does the step-up in cost basis. That's where the problem lies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Step-up means that the property heirs receive is valued as of the date of death. So if Grandma leaves a grandchild stock selling for $75 a share that was bought in 1970 for $2 per share, the heir's "cost basis" in the stock is $75. If the grandchild then sells the stock for $80, the taxable gain is $5 per share. The same holds true for both real estate and personal property, like an heirloom ring or art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Congress fails to extend the current system for 2010, then at the owner's death all assets would retain their original cost, called "carry-over basis." Under this system the heir's stock would have a cost basis of the original $2 per share rather than $75. If he then sells the stock at $80, the taxable gain would be $78 instead of $5—a huge difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the 2010 law as written gives each taxpayer $1.3 million worth of "free" step-up at death, but this is a far cry from the unlimited basis step-up under current law. Married couples get an additional $3 million at the death of the first spouse, heavily favoring them over individuals. The law also imposes a massive record-keeping burden over many decades, as executors would have to determine and heirs would have to track, asset by asset, how much of the valuable step-up each received.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carry-over basis was tried briefly in the mid-1970s as part of estate tax reform. "People were so outraged that Congress had to suspend it immediately and repeal it shortly after that," says veteran estate planner Sidney Kess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What if Congress doesn't get around to making an extension before Jan. 1? Contrary to what some believe, a retroactive estate tax isn't unconstitutional. In August l993 lawmakers raised estate tax rates to 55% and made the increase retroactive to the prior January. The estates of two taxpayers who died in the spring of 1993 challenged the law's retroactivity, and both lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less certain is the fate of other estate tax proposals currently in play. Several measures that are more generous than current law and would simplify planning have been introduced in a bill by Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They would raise the current lifetime gift tax exemption from $1 million to $3.5 million, in order to unify gift and estate tax systems; index the $3.5 million exemption for inflation; allow each partner in a married couple full use of the $3.5 million exemption without having to write special trusts; index the estate and gift taxes brackets for inflation; and allow "special-use" property a full $3.5 million exemption instead of the current $750,000. Special-use property is an asset, such as a farm in the middle of an expensive suburban area, that carries a below-market valuation appropriate to its original use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other techniques long used to trim estate taxes may be scaled back or prohibited, however. They include family limited partnerships; grantor retained annuity trusts (GRATs); and qualified personal residence trusts (QPRTs). All use a variety of legal means to freeze or undervalue assets that are being transferred out of the owner's estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts say these provisions could pop up in legislation this year or be postponed into next, when the tax climate will be very different. Under Congressional bookkeeping, any extension of the current system into next year counts as raising revenue because the tax is currently slated to lapse in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011, however, the exemption is supposed return to $1 million. So extending the $3.5 million exemption beyond 2010 will count a revenue loser at a time when deficit-cutting pressures will be intense.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After some recent hiccups, housing data are due to improve again -- but still not by enough to suggest housing is in the clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors is due Friday morning to release existing-home-sales figures for September. Economists estimate sales rose to an annualized pace of 5.38 million units, up 5.5% from a year earlier. That would be the fastest pace since August 2007. And it might ease some of the market's growing worries about whether a housing recovery is still on track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been a string of disappointing housing data recently, starting with an unexpected decline in August existing-home sales. It continued this week with a retreat in home-builder sentiment reported by the National Association of Home Builders, weaker-than-expected new-home construction data and an unexpected decline in the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>'s index of home prices in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists warned not to make too much of those reports. Low prices and mortgage rates, along with the tax credit for first-time home buyers, have spurred a home-buying bonanza, at least in the low end of the market. Housing inventory has shrunk, a helpful development for pricing power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The realtor association's measure of pending home sales, normally a good leading indicator of existing-home sales, rose 6.4% in August and is roughly consistent with an annualized sales pace of 5.8 million units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are still hurdles to closing deals, including tight credit and appraisal problems. Roughly a third of home resales are foreclosures or short sales, where the mortgage exceeds the sales price. These often take longer to close than nondistressed sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, unemployment is rising and the tax credit's future is uncertain. The Federal Reserve's mortgage-purchase program, which likely shaves more than 0.5 percentage point from mortgage rates, ends in early 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And typically in the fall and winter a greater percentage of sales are distressed, another drag on prices, notes <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> economist Michelle Meyer. <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> expects another 8% decline in the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home-price index through the first quarter of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, the best-case scenario for housing still seems to be a halting recovery.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate mogul Steven Roth has bought Bernard Madoff's beach house in Montauk, N.Y., for $9.41 million, nearly 6% more than its asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Roth, 67 years old, is chairman of <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span>, a real-estate investment trust that's one of the country's largest owners of retail and office space. He declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Set on 1.2 acres, the shingled, 3,000-square-foot home on New York's Long Island was put on the market by U.S. Marshals in September as part of the effort to repay the victims of Mr. Madoff's Ponzi scheme. The home garnered four bids, fetching more than its $8.75 million asking price. The sale closed last Friday. The property has 182 feet of ocean frontage, four bedrooms, three baths, a deck and a pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Madoffs purchased the land, minus some waterfront acreage, for $250,000 in the early 1980s. They later built the home and then added about 0.1 acre of waterfront for $20,000.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greene, 54 years old, bought the unfinished property out of receivership for $35 million in 2006 and has spent nearly three years and $15 million finishing it.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, Mr. Greene held a wedding on the property with boxer Mike Tyson as his best man, but says the home is too lavish for him and his wife to occupy full-time.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite some tentative signs of recovery, the U.S. housing market remains vulnerable to further price drops -- especially in areas where large numbers of mortgages are headed toward foreclosure over the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal's quarterly survey of housing-market data in 28 major metro areas shows sharp drops in the number of homes listed for sale across the country. But the potential supply of homes is far larger because banks are likely to acquire significant numbers of foreclosed homes in some areas, notably Las Vegas, Atlanta, Detroit, Phoenix, Miami and other parts of Florida, and Sacramento, Calif., over the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of those homes may depress prices further. By contrast, metro areas with relatively low foreclosure and mortgage-delinquency rates include Boston, Denver, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Seattle, Raleigh, N.C., and Portland, Ore., making them less vulnerable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners and potential buyers have been whipsawed by conflicting signals about the state of the market in recent months. Ulani and Mike Thiessen found the market surprisingly hot when they went shopping for their first home in Las Vegas during the summer. With the help of Kim Kelly-Reed, an agent from One Source Realty &amp;Management, the Thiessens finally bought a foreclosed house in September for about $136,000 -- but only after being outbid on three other houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a crazy market out there," says Ms. Thiessen, who works for an electrical contractor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite a continuing surge in defaults, there is a shortage of well-preserved foreclosed homes on the market in Las Vegas, Sacramento and some other metro areas where first-time home buyers have been competing with investors for newly affordable properties. "Anything under $300,000 that is decent within hours has dozens of offers," says Michael Lyon, CEO of Lyon Real Estate in Sacramento.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of foreclosed homes listed for sale has dwindled largely because of government-mandated efforts to save as many borrowers as possible from losing their homes. That campaign has gummed up the foreclosure process, slowing the flow of houses into bank ownership -- but only temporarily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next few years, housing analysts believe, millions of other homes are heading for bank ownership, but no one can say how long that will take or when a sudden torrent of bank-owned properties may swamp certain local markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 27% of first-lien home mortgages are at least 30 days overdue or in foreclosure in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area, according to research firm LPS Applied Analytics in Denver. The rate is 23% in Las Vegas, but about 8% in Denver and Seattle. The national average is 12.4%, up from 5.2% at the end of 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the millions of homeowners whose fate remains undecided are Jill and Robert Loy, who live in Scottsdale, Ariz. They bought their home in 2004 for $630,000 but figure it is now worth only about $350,000, well below the $470,000 owed on their mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple fell behind on their loan payments last spring when Ms. Loy was temporarily jobless, and they have been trying to work out a modification of their loan terms with the company that collects payments on their mortgage, Colonial Savings FA of Fort Worth, Texas. A Colonial spokeswoman says the bank is trying to help the Loys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is heading into the winter doldrums -- when fewer people shop for real estate -- after a summer marked by strong demand for low-end to midrange homes, spurred by a temporary federal tax credit for first-time buyers. How the market fares in the spring will depend largely on the state of the economy and the pace of foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The number of people receiving paychecks will drive the demand for houses and apartments," Jay Brinkmann, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, said Tuesday in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee, "and the recovery will begin when unemployment stops rising."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the market seems to be stabilizing, says Jeffrey Otteau, president of Otteau Valuation Group, an East Brunswick, N.J., appraisal firm. But if the job market gets much worse and mortgage rates rise sharply, "that could be the tipping point" for another drop in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com, predicts that average national home prices will bottom out in next year's third quarter, assuming that employment begins growing again in mid-2010. But prices in some metro areas still have a long way to fall, he believes. Prices in the second quarter of 2010 will be down about 30% from a year earlier in Miami, 27% in Orlando, Fla., 24% in Las Vegas and 23% in Phoenix, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures and short sales (in which a home is offered for less than the mortgage balance) dominate the markets in some metro areas. Satish M. Mansukhani, a market strategist in New York, estimates that such "distressed" homes account for 79% of home listings in the Detroit area and 75% in Las Vegas, but just 16% in Houston and 7% in Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One big question is how much more the federal government will do to prop up housing. Congress is debating whether to extend the tax credit for home buyers beyond Nov. 30. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is phasing out its massive purchases of mortgage-backed securities and plans to conclude the program by the end of March. Those purchases have helped keep interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages around 5%. Mr. Zandi says mortgage rates are likely to rise as much as one percentage point after the Fed ends that support. Analysts at <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> in New York forecast mortgage rates will be slightly over 6% by the end of March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While supplies of moderately priced homes have shrunk, there is still a glut of high-priced houses in many areas, suggesting that prices on those properties may fall sharply as more owners default. In Sacramento, there are enough homes on the market at $600,000 and above to last more than 15 months at the recent rate of sales, compared with just 1.5 months for homes priced at $300,000 and below, according to Lyon Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sellers will also face tougher competition from landlords, who generally have been cutting rents in the past year. The national apartment-vacancy rate in the third quarter was 7.8%, the highest in 23 years, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a New York research firm. It predicts "a few more quarters of distress, lower rents and higher vacancies."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment rents may face further downward pressure as investors buy foreclosed single-family homes and turn them into rental units, says Ryan Severino, an economist at Reis, who notes that there is little data on the number of houses being converted into rental properties.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty </div><div>494 words</div><div>21 October 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts increased 0.5% in September to a 590,000 seasonally adjusted annual rate, the latest piece of data to show the housing market is slowly stabilizing with help from low prices and government tax credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Labor Department reported wholesale prices for finished goods fell 0.6% in September, while the "core" measure that excludes volatile food and energy prices fell 0.1%, a sign that despite the tepid economic recovery, producers still have little leeway to raise prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in housing starts was the third in four months, but despite a slow recovery in housing, the report offered few signs of momentum. Many homes have been rushed to completion so that potential buyers can qualify for the $8,000 first-time home buyer tax credit that expires next month. As a result, housing starts that would have occurred later in 2009 and 2010 have been shifted to the early quarters this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">August housing starts were revised to an annual pace of 587,000 -- 11,000 fewer than originally reported, according to the Commerce Department. And building permits, an indication of future construction activity, fell 1.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 573,000. Single-family permits fell 3.0% from August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing is off its lows but doesn't have a whole lot of momentum. That's the story of the economy right now," said David Greenlaw, an economist at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report on producer prices -- which are down 4.8% from year ago levels -- show that wholesalers still have considerable slack in their operations. Price competition, combined with increases in worker productivity that have kept a lid on labor costs, is giving wholesalers the freedom to pass along price decreases to their customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, a U.S. government report showed a rise in consumer prices in September, but the 0.2% jump was smaller than the 0.4% rise registered for August. The slower pace -- along with decreases in producer prices -- suggests that inflation remains subdued. That gives the Federal Reserve continued freedom to leave interest rates low to aid the economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's PPI data showed a 2.4% fall in energy prices in September after an 8.0% surge the previous month. The September decline in energy prices was led by falling gasoline prices, which declined 5.4%. Falling prices for home-heating oil and residential natural gas also contributed to the September decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Food prices were also down. They fell 0.1% in September. Prices of passenger cars rose 1.0% last month, while light truck prices fell 1.4%. Prices of raw materials, known as crude goods, fell 2.1% on the month, while prices for intermediate goods rose 0.2% in September. Core intermediate goods increased 0.9%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major stock markets in Asia enjoyed a broad rally Tuesday, with technology shares among the winners after strong earnings from the sector's counterparts in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But U.S. data on housing starts weighed on European shares, which ended a choppy session in the negative column.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asian shares were mostly lower in early Wednesday trading, with BHP Billiton falling in Sydney despite a solid first-quarter production update. Japan was down 0.3%, with South Korea flat, Australia off 0.4% and New Zealand down 0.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In TOKYO Tuesday, Japan's Nikkei Stock Average of 225 companies rose 1% to 10336.84, its highest close in almost a month. Among tech shares, <span class="companylink">Tokyo Electron</span> closed up 1.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In SYDNEY, Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 closed up 1.1% at 4846.20. Stronger commodity prices and the central bank's outlook for the mining industry helped metal stocks. BHP Billiton rose 2.1%, <span class="companylink">Rio Tinto</span> added 3.3% and Equinox Minerals climbed 3.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Oil Search fell 7.3% after Monday's news of the termination of a deal designed to help fund its share of the proposed US$15 billion <span class="companylink">Exxon Mobil</span>-led PNG LNG project in Papua New Guinea, with the company undertaking an institutional share placement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In SHANGHAI, the Shanghai Composite rose 1.5% to 3084.45, its highest close since Aug. 13, buoyed by expectations that more short-term capital would flow into China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the drop in Europe, bulls said the ingredients were in place for further gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Against a background of extremely accommodative monetary conditions, stock markets are well supported," said Margaret Lawson, fund manager of the SVM 100 Select fund, which invests in top British companies. "[We] expect a strong earnings season, which will act as a catalyst for the rally to continue."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In LONDON, the FTSE 100 index fell 0.7% to 5243.40. <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> slipped 4.8% after Qatar Holding sold some of its stake in the bank. But media group Pearson rose 4.4% after it raised its fiscal-year forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In PARIS, the CAC-40 index shed 0.5% to 3871.45. <span class="companylink">Saint-Gobain</span> fell 3.6% on profit-taking ahead of its third-quarter revenue to be published Thursday.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> may decide to take its final lumps on its unsuccessful $6.5 billion acquisition of <span class="companylink">Crescent Real Estate Equities Co</span>., the latest of several setbacks for the firm known as one of Wall Street's largest property investors and managers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> already has taken about $700 million in write-downs and other losses from Crescent, which owned 54 office buildings, resorts and housing projects at the time of the firm's 2007 top-of-the-market buyout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the investment bank is under pressure to turn the portfolio over to <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>, which provided a $2 billion loan to help finance the Crescent deal. The debt is due on Nov. 2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With commercial-property values tumbling and rent rolls declining, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> likely will give up Crescent's properties to the <span class="companylink">Barclays PLC</span> unit, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the firm also is considering other options such as putting in more capital to keep the investment afloat, these people said. Negotiations with <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> could extend beyond the Nov. 2 deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of the end of the second quarter, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> carried the Crescent properties on its books with a value of $2.8 billion and debt of $2.5 billion, according to a research report by analysts at <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>., based on their meeting with Morgan Stanley Chief Finance Officer Colm Kelleher in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would mean the firm's remaining equity in the deal is about $300 million, which would be wiped out should <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> opt to turn over the keys to <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> and walk away from the investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representatives at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> and <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shareholders of <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> will likely get a more detailed picture of the firm's Crescent position when it reports third-quarter earnings Wednesday. In its second-quarter report with the Securities and Exchange Commission, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> said a subsidiary of the firm "is currently in discussions with the lender regarding the orderly transfer of collateral and asset operations and other related matters."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Crescent deal underscores the problems faced by U.S. financial institutions as a result of their aggressive push into commercial real estate when credit was easy and prices were rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest third-quarter earnings from U.S. banks show that commercial real estate is becoming a bigger drag on the economy as well as banks' bottom line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>., one of the nation's largest lenders to commercial-property developers and investors, nonperforming commercial real-estate loans reached $6.9 billion in the third quarter, or 9.6% of its total such loans outstanding. That figure more than doubled the level in the year-earlier period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial real-estate problems began mounting last year as the credit crisis made refinancing debt difficult. But the situation is worsening because thousands of hotels, office buildings, stores and other properties are suffering declining incomes and can no longer pay debt service on the money they borrowed when times were good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> may soon have this problem with Crescent, some analysts say. Cash flow from Crescent's office properties, which make up the bulk of the portfolio, will likely fall below the amount required to pay debt service next year, according to an analysis by Matthew Anderson, partner at Foresight Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time of the acquisition, the properties were generating cash flow that was 2.5 times debt service, he said. That "debt-service coverage ratio" has fallen to 1.3 this year and will likely drop to between 0.8 and 0.9 in 2010, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> has been selling Crescent properties to reduce debt since the deal was completed in August 2007. As a result, the kind of buildings in the Crescent portfolio have changed over time, which could have affected the cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s plans for Crescent ran off the track soon after it bought the portfolio from Richard Rainwater, the renowned Texas investor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> originally planned to put the properties in one of the real-estate funds it manages for institutions and wealthy individuals. But fund investors balked at buying the buildings at top-of-the-market prices, forcing <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> to keep the properties on its own balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> debt originally was due Aug. 3, but the bank agreed to a three-month extension.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investment firms without the balance sheets of large investment banks typically don't buy property for real-estate funds until the money has been raised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benefit of buying before the money is in place -- as <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> did with Crescent -- is that it allows investment banks to move quickly. But they risk losing investor commitments if the property they buy becomes undesirable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> has been one of the most active real-estate fund managers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm announced raising at least $14 billion in 2006 and 2007 for its series of real-estate funds known as MSREF, which have taken some big hits as the property market has soured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">California State Teachers' Retirement System</span>, for instance, reports its $400 million investment in <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s MSREF VI International LP fund was down 80% as of March 31, and that its $137 million net investment in the MSREF V U.S. LP fund was worth $300,000. Other <span class="companylink">Calstrs</span> real-estate investments with <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> have fared better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MSREF's bad bets include an investment in North Carolina developer <span class="companylink">Crescent Resources</span> (unrelated to <span class="companylink">Crescent Real Estate Equities</span>), which filed for bankruptcy protection in June, and a $3 billion portfolio of German office buildings.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks finished lower and oil snapped an eight-day winning streak as new economic data and bearish analyst comments reignited investors' worries about the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A weak reading of housing starts touched off the declines Tuesday, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average down almost 100 points shortly after noon. It managed to recoup about half that drop, closing down 50.71 points, or 0.5%, at 10041.48.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Boeing</span> was the biggest decliner, off 2.9% after <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> cut its rating on the aircraft maker to "underweight" from "equal weight," citing concerns about the 787. <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> is scheduled to report earnings Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DuPont fell 2.2% after reporting rising profits but declining sales. The Dow's losses were tempered by a 3% rise in Caterpillar after the industrial giant exceeded third-quarter profit expectations by a wide margin and raised its full-year profit outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500-stock index was down 0.6% to 1091.06, as oil prices retreated and weighed on energy stocks. Crude futures slipped 0.7% to $79.09 a barrel, snapping an eight-day streak in which oil soared 14%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's an underlying hesitation among investors about the sustainability of the economic recovery," said <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> strategist Binky Chadha. "People have been looking for positive earnings surprises, but a lot of that was priced in earlier than expected. Instead, what you have is people shrugging off the reports or trading on the macroeconomic data."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite Index slid 0.6% despite Apple's 4.7% gain after it reported a 47% jump in quarterly profit late Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Tuesday's close, <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> said its third-quarter profit more than tripled, sending its shares up 5.3% to $18.08 each in after-hours trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Treasury prices rose, yields on the 10-year and two-year note fell to their lowest levels in a week. The dollar's small rise against the euro was its second consecutive gain.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Commercial Market Gains Footing; Sales Move Higher for Europe Property, but Challenges Remain</span>
</div><div class="author">By William Boston   </div><div>Special to the WSJ</div>
<div>959 words</div><div>21 October 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>C10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in European commercial-property sales, which was evident in the third quarter, is picking up steam. But the market still has a long way to go before it reaches a semblance of normalcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early last week, <span class="companylink">IVG Immobilien AG</span>, the German property group with nearly €23 billion ($34 billion) of assets under management, was hamstrung with a loan-to-value ratio of an estimated 90%. But by the end of the week, IVG unveiled the sale of five properties for about €470 million, transforming itself from a debt-saddled firm into an opportunistic predator. IVG had planned to sell property valued at €1 billion by the end of 2010. Having reached the goal a year early, it can get on with its business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our work will now focus on...improving the company's operations and taking advantage of selected market opportunities," said Gerhard Niesslein, the company's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another sign Europe's publicly traded property companies are turning the corner: <span class="companylink">British Land Co</span>., one of the U.K.'s largest publicly traded property companies, announced Monday that it had purchased 39 Victoria Street, an office building in London's posh West End district, for £40 million ($66 million). The building is rented to <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> until July 2012 and marks the first time <span class="companylink">British Land</span> has acquired anything since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a small deal, but it is one of the first reasonable deals and may signal the beginning of purchases by listed property companies," said Harm Meijer, head of European property research at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change in mood is also reflected in the latest data. Investment in European commercial property surged 53% in the third quarter to €19.6 billion, from €12.8 billion in the second quarter, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the property-services group. Still, that pales in comparison to earlier years. There was €44 billion in investment in European commercial property in the first nine months of 2009, compared with €203 billion in the same period of 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mood in Europe is noticeably more upbeat than in the U.S. One reason is that the U.S. still has to figure out how to handle its massive overhang of commercial mortgage-backed securities, which played a much larger role in property financing in the U.S. than in Europe. "Europe used CMBS, but it pales in comparison to what is going on in the U.S.," says Steve Collins, managing director of the international capital group at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand from foreign investors for European property also is intensifying. Debt remains scarce but is becoming more available for small deals or transactions in which the buyer puts in 40% to 50% equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group</span> is selling its office building at 20 Columbus Courtyard in London's Canary Wharf district to a group of Lebanese investors led by M1 Real Estate for more than £150 million ($246 million). The Swiss bank will remain as a tenant with a 25-year lease. M1 Real Estate is based in Monaco and is a unit of M1 Group, whose founder is Najib Mikati, the former Lebanese prime minister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another Canary Wharf deal being closely watched is the <span class="companylink">HSBC Holdings PLC</span> global headquarters building. <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> sold its main New York City building this month to IDB Group, an Israeli investment holding company, for $330 million and has put its London property on the block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are encouraged by the steep fall in European commercial-property valuations and evidence that prices have hit bottom or are very close. Property values have fallen 22% in Europe as a whole since the peak in 2007, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield. In Western Europe, the U.K. took the hardest hit, falling 40%. Excluding the U.K., property values fell 17% in Western Europe, while Central Europe slipped 26% and Eastern Europe plunged 45%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past six months the fall in property values has slowed or stopped in some markets and prices have begun to stabilize. Average European prime commercial property yields stood at 7.51% in the third quarter. Yields are an indication of property prices. A lower yield indicates prices are rising. European average yield fell slightly, affected by a fall of 0.24 percentage point to 6.73% in the U.K.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is in the U.K., which was one of the property markets hit hardest by the financial crisis, where the strongest signs of recovery can be seen. According to the closely followed monthly IPD Capital Growth index, the market value of U.K. commercial property rose 1.1% in September, the largest monthly increase since June 2006. Capital growth in the third quarter was 1.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news isn't all good. The recession is still working its way through the economy, and analysts warn the current recovery could be short-lived unless the broader economy recovers and improves the fundamentals of the real-estate industry. While the IPD data show property prices are recovering, growth was stunted by falling rents. Prime rents fell 7.9% across Europe in the third quarter. Continued weakness in the broader economy creates uncertainty about the prospects for the coming year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The jury's out on what 2010 may hold," said David Hutchings, head of European research at Cushman &amp; Wakefield, in a statement. "There are still plenty of problems for the market to deal with, but with two quarters of growth in activity and much improved sentiment, it's clear that we've turned an important corner."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Deborah Lynn Blumberg </div><div>222 words</div><div>21 October 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>18</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Treasury prices jumped after data showed a heftier-than-expected drop in producer prices and a smaller-than-anticipated rise in housing starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increases were most pronounced in longer-term Treasurys, which are the most sensitive to inflation. Together, the reports served as a reminder that price pressures remain tame as the U.S. economy recovers at a gradual pace, facing some setbacks along the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At late afternoon, the 30-year Treasury was outperforming, up by 1 1/32 to yield 4.159%. The 10-year issue was up 16/32 to yield 3.337%. Bond prices move inversely to bond yields. "The inflation numbers are showing a downward trend; the idea is that inflation really isn't a problem," said Tom Tucci, head of government-bond trading at <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders also said many market participants had been low on Treasurys early Tuesday, expecting the market to be weaker after its recent good run. When data started to push prices higher, many were forced to come in and buy. Mr. Tucci noted that longer-term Treasurys should also find some support heading into the Fed's latest Treasury-buying operation on Wednesday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Basic-materials and energy stocks led U.S. markets lower as a smaller-than-expected rise in housing starts deflated some optimism about corporate profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported that new construction on housing units was essentially flat in September. Analysts had been expecting activity to pick up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By early Tuesday afternoon in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 71.79 points, or 0.7%, at 10020.40, retreating from a one-year high set in the previous session.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow's losses were tempered by a 2.2% rise in component Caterpillar after the company exceeded third-quarter profit expectations. The company's revenue was down from a year ago, but it raised its full-year profit forecast.</p>

</div><div class="author">By John D. McKinnon </div><div>700 words</div><div>20 October 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The Internal Revenue Service is examining more than 100,000 suspicious claims for the first-time home-buyer tax break, another sign of potential trouble for the soon-to-expire program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measure, adopted in February as part of the economic-stimulus bill, gives first-time buyers an $8,000 tax credit in an effort to boost sales and stimulate the moribund housing market. The program is set to end Nov. 30, but housing-industry leaders are lobbying Congress to extend it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than a million claims for the credit have been received so far, and housing-industry experts estimated that the credit has helped generate about 350,000 home sales that wouldn't otherwise have occurred. But some lawmakers and tax experts now say there is evidence that a significant number of the claims might prove to be unjustified, or even fraudulent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am concerned about recent reports that there have been fraudulent schemes involving the credit," Rep. John Lewis (D., Ga.), chairman of a House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee, said in a statement. The subcommittee is planning a hearing on the problems on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The IRS said it was investigating 167 "criminal schemes" involving the credit, according to the subcommittee. IRS officials on Monday declined to describe the suspected schemes or provide additional details.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a recent hearing of a White House tax advisory panel, Bonnie Speedy, national director of AARP Tax-Aide, a volunteer service for low-income people, suggested that abuse of the home-purchase credit appeared to be widespread, in part because of relatively loose standards for claiming the credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The credit "has some fraud issues because it's not being done at the time of the sale," said Ms. Speedy. "People are filing for the home credit who don't have a right to file for it." Taxpayers don't have to file their claims as part of a real-estate transaction and instead can file or amend their income-tax returns to claim the credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for the National Association of Realtors, Lucien Salvant, said, "Any time there is a lot of money around, there is going to be people attracted to it with evil intent."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-industry officials recently have stepped up their lobbying for an extension of the credit. In a letter to the Obama administration on Monday, the National Association of Realtors, the National Association of Home Builders and the Mortgage Bankers Association called for a 12-month extension of the credit. They also asked that the tax break be extended to all home buyers -- not just first-time purchasers -- and noted that they were urging Congress to expand its value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our fragile economy is just beginning to show signs of recovery," the letter says. "We should not jeopardize that recovery by letting this tax credit expire."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Salvant said the industry groups weren't suggesting any changes to the credit policy aimed at diminishing possible fraud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea of extending, or expanding, home buyers' tax credit has been met with skepticism from some lawmakers, who cite the potential costs and impact on the surging federal budget deficits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One proposal by Sen. Johnny Isakson (R., Ga.) and others to extend the credit and make it available to all home buyers through June 2010 carries a price tag of about $16.7 billion. That proposal would raise the income ceiling for eligible home buyers to $150,000 per year for an individual and $300,000 for a couple. Currently the credit phases out for individuals earning more than $75,000 and married couples earning more than $150,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ted Gayer, an economist at the Brookings Institution, a liberal think tank based in Washington, estimated that the current credit costs the government about $43,000 for each additional home sale it generates, because most of the two million or so home buyers expected to claim the credit would have bought a house anyway. Expanding the credit to all home buyers would raise the government's cost per additional home sale to more than $250,000, he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos and Jessica Holzer </div><div>565 words</div><div>20 October 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration unveiled steps to help state and local housing-finance agencies provide mortgages and rental housing to thousands of low- and moderate-income families, underscoring the expansive role the government has taken to stabilize the U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State and local housing-finance agencies, or HFAs, play a modest role in the housing market but represent one of the few sources of mortgages for many first-time and low-income home buyers. The federal aid is designed to revive HFAs' lending by shoring up their financing. State agencies sharply curtailed their lending after the credit crunch deepened one year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax-exempt bond issuance by HFAs has fallen to $4 billion in 2009 from $10 billion last year and $16 billion in 2007, according to the National Council of State Housing Agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This initiative is crucial to helping working families maintain access to affordable rental housing and homeownership in tough economic times," Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the program, the Treasury Department will purchase securities from <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> that are backed by state and local housing-agency bonds. Before using the proceeds of new bonds under that program, the HFAs will have to sell a portion of new debt to private investors in an effort to attract private capital to the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing agencies were slammed by a host of market forces a year ago, when the pool of investors who could take advantage of tax-exempt securities shrank and interest rates rose on municipal securities. Administration efforts to lower mortgage rates through government purchases of mortgage-backed securities have also competed against state agencies, making it harder for them to offer attractive financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury program will also allow Fannie and Freddie to offer temporary funding mechanisms designed to lower the costs associated with short-term debt that states increasingly issued in recent years to fund long-term mortgages. Around 38 HFAs have some $30 billion in variable-rate debt outstanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some HFAs began a painful deleveraging process after that funding mechanism -- intended to increase the agencies' lending ability -- backfired. Some state housing agencies, including those in California and Wisconsin, have largely stopped making new loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury said it hadn't yet determined the scale of either initiative and wouldn't provide a dollar amount. Officials said the program would be funded by fees paid by the HFAs, in order to avoid any taxpayer subsidy. "We thought this was an appropriate and confined area in which we should take action," said Michael Barr, an assistant treasury secretary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HFAs finance the development of affordable rental housing and offer a range of programs to first-time home buyers, including counseling for borrowers that begins before they buy a home and assistance programs that lend down payments and closing costs to borrowers. Loans from HFAs require full documentation of incomes, and have performed better than subprime loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One of the unfortunate takeaways from the subprime crisis is that working people can't sustain homeownership. They can, if it's done right," said Barbara Thompson, executive director of the National Council of State Housing Agencies, a trade group that represents state HFAs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO — The Japanese stock market ended on a mixed note Monday, weighed down by weakness among exporter stocks, but finding some support from a rebound in shares of <span class="companylink">Japan Airlines</span>. Property plays rallied in China, providing a lift to the mainland market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This week's trade, both locally and in the U.S., is packed with potential catalysts that are crucial in determining market direction over the next month or two," said Ben Potter, a research analyst at IG Markets in Melbourne.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan's Nikkei 225 closed with a loss of 0.2% and Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 lost 0.9%, but the Topix tacked on 0.5% in Tokyo. South Korea's Kospi Composite added 0.5%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng finished 1.2% higher and the Shanghai Composite Index gained 2.1%. Taiwan shares climbed 0.5% and New Zealand's NZX-ended 0.4% higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All markets around the globe are priced for a global economic recovery," said Tony Sagami, editor of Asia Stock Alert, adding that the optimism for such a recovery seemed unjustified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exporter shares were among the losers in Tokyo, with <span class="companylink">Pioneer Corp</span>. falling 2.9% and <span class="companylink">Sharp Corp</span>. down 1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Asian export-sensitive companies and sovereigns seemed to react with concern to a multipointed set of risks," said Richard Hastings, consumer strategist at <span class="companylink">Global Hunter Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those risks include credit problems at U.S. megabanks <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, last week's worrisome downside momentum to the U.S. dollar, continued weakness in the asset valuation trends for commercial real estate in the U.S. and "fears that crude oil prices could rise sufficiently to derail earnings and growth trends at a variety of companies internationally," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technology shares finished mostly higher, rebounding from earlier declines on the heels of a 5% drop in <span class="companylink">International Business Machines</span> in the U.S. on Friday. IBM indicated businesses were still reluctant to resume spending. <span class="companylink">Sony</span> rose 0.4% in Tokyo. <span class="companylink">Samsung Electronics</span> added 0.7% in Seoul, Hynix climbed 0.3%, and <span class="companylink">LG Electronics</span> closed up 3.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JAL gained 12% in Tokyo, even as doubts continued about its restructuring plan. The Nikkei reported in its Sunday edition that the three megabanks that had lent heavily to JAL had decided the Transport Ministry's rehabilitation plan was unacceptable, though the Sankei Shimbun said over the weekend that the government was set to bail the carrier out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Higher jet fuel prices would only worsen situations at struggling airlines such as <span class="companylink">Japan Airlines</span>, and if this were to evolve into higher gas prices in the U.S., then the consumer's encouraging improvement in the U.S. could be reversed, and this dilemma is unsettling markets internationally in subtle ways right now," said Mr. Hastings. JAL shares dropped 11% Friday, touching an all-time low of ¥100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China property shares outperformed on better-than-expected property sales and hopes for strong earnings. <span class="companylink">China Vanke</span> rose 6.8% in Shenzhen, while Gemdale gained 8.3% and Poly Real Estate advanced 4.9% in Shanghai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"(It now appears) property developers' third-quarter earnings will be better than the market had anticipated, which led to fund managers actively adding positions in the sector," said Huatai Securities analyst Chen Huiqin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial stocks fell in Sydney and Hong Kong, with ANZ off 3.4% and National Bank of Australia down 2.2%. ICBC fell 0.7% and Hang Seng Bank was off 0.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil stocks outperformed in Hong Kong, with <span class="companylink">PetroChina</span> up 3% after November Nymex crude futures rose 1.2% to $78.53 per barrel Friday in New York and hit a fresh 2009 high above $79 in Globex trade Monday. Cnooc gained 4.2%, also supported by news of its talks with Norway's <span class="companylink">StatoilHydro</span> for a few leases in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But energy stocks fell in Sydney after Oil Search flagged a capital raising following the shock termination of a proposed deal with Abu Dhabi-based <span class="companylink">International Petroleum Investment Co</span>. Woodside finished down 0.2% and Santos fell 2.4%, while trading in Oil Search shares remained halted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Korea, <span class="companylink">Ssangyong Motor</span> shot up 15% after the company said Sunday it would reorganize its product portfolio, focusing on small and midsize sport utility vehicles as part of a turnaround effort within the next three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singapore shares were up 0.2% in late trading and Thailand shares rose 0.6% while Indonesia stocks fell 0.3%. Stocks in the Philippines closed up 0.3%. India markets were closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Japanese yen was bid higher in currency markets as a safe-haven play against Tokyo's stock-market slip. The U.S. dollar was down at ¥90.53, from an early-Asia high of ¥91.13, with the euro at ¥135.16, from ¥135.91 earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Australian dollar was on the rise after <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of Australia</span> Assistant Governor Phil Lowe said the central bank expects a higher average exchange rate in the future. The currency rose from around 91.20 U.S. cents to 92.08 U.S. cents recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further broad U.S. dollar weakness could be in store this week, said <span class="companylink">Bank of New Zealand</span> strategist Mike Jones. "The trend recovery in global growth and risk appetite looks set to continue and sustained gains in U.S. interest rates remain some way off yet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lead December Japanese government bond futures were down 0.05 at 138.83 points before an auction of 20-year notes Tuesday. The 10-year note yield was 1.5 basis points higher at 1.340%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spot gold was up $2.10 from New York's Friday levels, at $1,054.90 a troy ounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold "may look to consolidate in the $1,040-$1,065 area, although gold will be quick to follow the dollar should the greenback break from its own phase of consolidation," James Moore, an analyst at TheBullionDesk.com, said in a Monday note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">HSBC</span> analyst James Steel said the gold market was also concerned about a lack of jewelry demand from India. "While gold has largely taken its cue from dollar movements, high prices have undermined retail demand for bullion over the past 12 months. Based on our conversations with merchants in India, we believe physical demand for gold picked up only modestly ahead of the Deepavali festival, which is traditionally a time of gold gift-giving."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate database operator <span class="companylink">China Real Estate Information Corp</span>. proved there still is interest from U.S. investors in Asian growth companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday, in its debut on the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq Stock Market</span>, the company's shares were at $14.20 in 4 p.m. composite trading, up 18% from the initial-public-offering price of $12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Shanghai company sold 18 million American depositary receipts at the low end of its expected price range of $11.80 to $13.80 a share, which was set by underwriters <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group</span> and UBS AG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China Real Estate was a surprise turnaround in an otherwise unremarkable week in the U.S. IPO market. On Tuesday, rail-line operator <span class="companylink">RailAmerica Inc</span>. fell 8% on its first day of trading. Friday, RailAmerica closed at $14.26, up 25 cents, or 1.8%, but that still was below the IPO price of $15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was some concern that China Real Estate would be another dud, especially after China online-gambling company <span class="companylink">Shanda Games Ltd</span>.'s flop in September. Shanda, which had generated a lot of pre-IPO buzz, fell 14% on its first day of trading and still is below the $12.50 IPO price, closing at $10.32 on Friday, up five cents, or 0.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China Real Estate operates a database and analysis system on residential real-estate developments, with real-estate developers as its major clients; it has the largest market share in its niche, according to Frost &amp;Sullivan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the real-estate market in the U.S. still is depressed, China's has rebounded from its 2008 downturn, with many cities experiencing an increase in prices and transactions, according to the company's prospectus. The rebound has occurred alongside a rise in the volume of bank loans made as China responded to the global economic crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market has recovered to the point that it rose above 2007 levels in the first half of 2009, according to company co-Chairmen Xin Zhou and Charles Chao.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Since the financial crises, the Chinese government's policy has been toward protecting economic growth and employment levels, so the real-estate market should be a big beneficiary of these policies," Mr. Zhou said during a telephone interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue and earnings at China Real Estate have been increasing throughout the global economic slowdown. In the first half of 2009, revenue rose 62% to $31.2 million and net income rose 53% to $11 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China Real Estate is being carved out of parent <span class="companylink">E-House (China) Holdings Ltd</span>., which continues to hold a 51% stake in the company; all proceeds raised will go to China Real Estate, which plans to use the funds to expand sales and marketing, as well as for other corporate purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">E-House made its own U.S. IPO debut in August 2007, gaining 41% on its first day of trading; it closed at $21.40 Friday, down slightly for the day but up 55% from its $13.80 IPO price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morningstar Inc</span>. put out a negative review of the China Real Estate IPO, saying there was too much uncertainty surrounding the company. Development of China's nascent real-estate market is in its early stages and the company has a number of competitors that also provide nationwide data and information; in addition, its customer base is too concentrated, with one company accounting for nearly half its revenue in the first six months of 2009, according to Morningstar equity analyst Todd Lukasik.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG -- <span class="companylink">Evergrande Real Estate Group</span> has resurrected its plans to conduct an initial public offering and aims to raise $700 million to $1 billion from a Hong Kong listing, people familiar with the situation said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Guangzhou property developer, known for its heavy debt levels and aggressive expansion plans, shelved a planned $2.1 billion IPO in March 2008 as the local stock market became volatile after some heady gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scaled-back fund raising is also lower than the $1.5 billion it was said to be looking to raise half a year ago, when it was testing the market while Hong Kong was experiencing a revival in investor appetite for new issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more modest fund-raising, which kicks off next week, has been driven by an increasingly lackluster attitude toward listings by Chinese property developers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late 2004, when Tishman Speyer Properties became one of the first U.S. real-estate companies to launch a publicly listed fund on the Australian Stock Exchange, the future looked bright.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Tishman Speyer Office Fund</span> gave Tishman a fresh source of capital, while offering Australian investors a chance to profit from the rising tide in U.S. office values with the security of knowing one of New York's most prominent property owners and developers was at their side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years later, the outlook is much grimmer for the fund that is managed by a subsidiary of the Tishman empire that also owns New York's Rockefeller Center and the Chrysler Building. The stock price, which touched highs near A$3 in early 2007, are off the lows in the single penny range this year but are still trading in the 35-cent range. And in the latest sign of its troubles, the fund is scrambling to raise cash and reduce its debt load by selling two California office buildings at substantial losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For fiscal year ending June 2009 the Tishman fund had an accounting loss after-tax of A$628.6 million ($568.2 million) compared with an after-tax loss of A$112 million in the year earlier. The 2009 loss was largely due to the decline in the value of its portfolio. As of June 30, the value of the fund's share of the portfolio was down about 34% to US$1.5 billion from a year earlier, the company reported. A spokesman for the fund and Tishman Speyer Properties declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of U.S. investment companies have raised money in Australia, tapping into the legal requirement for Australians to invest a chunk of their income in retirement funds. The Tishman fund has amassed a portfolio of 18 prime office buildings with tony addresses in such locations as Manhattan, Beverly Hills, Calif., and Chicago. As of June 30, the <span class="companylink">Tishman Speyer Office Fund</span> had about US$564.5 million in debt at the fund level and US$1.3 billion in asset-level debt, according to an analysis by Deloitte Corporate Finance, of Sydney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign that Tishman may have paid too dearly for some of those prime properties, the fund is now taking losses as it sells the properties into the downturn. "Investors are selling some of their healthiest assets in order to take care of other distressed issues," says Dan Fasulo, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a New York real estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund has a contract to sell the so-called Gap Building at 550 Terry Francois Blvd. in San Francisco to GLL Real Estate Partners, a manager of investment funds based in Munich, Germany, according to Tishman public documents and people familiar with the transaction. Tishman, which paid US$173.1 million for the building in 2005, has an agreement to sell the property for US$136.5 million property, according to a Sept. 28 company statement. GLL is expected to assume an existing $107.5 million mortgage on the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Tishman fund has said it expects to close the sale of a 246,817-square-foot office building called 3 MacArthur Place in Santa Ana, Calif. sometime this week to an undisclosed buyer. The sale of the Orange County building, which was about 78% leased in June, is expected to fetch about US$30 million. In 2007, Tishman paid $83.7 million for the property, according to company documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales of the buildings at a loss are just a piece of the financial woes that have faced the Tishman fund recently. In fact, the sales are a necessary pain that the fund has undertaken to dig itself out from a US$164 million loan due to mature in December. <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span> is the lead lender of a group of banks providing this loan.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Christina S.N. Lewis </div><div>796 words</div><div>14 October 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City real-estate developer Aby Rosen is joining the long list of investors who have headaches from buying pieces of Sam Zell's $39 billion office building empire when it was dissolved in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosen, also is a well-known art collector and fixture in Manhattan society, paid $850 million back then for seven Stamford, Conn., office buildings. Now, the portfolio's value has plunged, and Mr. Rosen is in talks to modify the $300 million first mortgage secured by the properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, the loan, which was converted into commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, was transferred to a special servicer, a company that handles loans that are troubled and require attention. <span class="companylink">RFR Holding LLC</span>, the New York-based firm founded by Mr. Rosen and his partner Michael Fuchs, said negotiations with lenders were due to a "minor required loan modification," and didn't involve a shortfall or default. The company declined to elaborate further. The special servicer, Centerline Capital Group, didn't respond to a request to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many investors who bought at the top of the market, Mr. Rosen has seen the value of his Stamford properties fall sharply. He paid roughly $513 a square foot for the 1.6 million-square-foot portfolio. The property's value has dropped 30% or more, according to an estimate by Dan Fasulo, head of research for <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of real-estate loans in special servicing is expected to increase sharply over the next few years as the commercial real-estate market deteriorates and the number of troubled loans rises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of September, about $9.4 billion in office loans were being handled by a special servicer, according to Trepp LLC, a research firm, representing 4.2% of all outstanding office CMBS. At the same time last year, just 0.4% of office loans, totaling less than $1 billion, were in special servicing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Treasury Department rule change in September that made it easier for property owners to restructure CMBS is also likely to increase the number of loans in special servicing, as landlords seek loan modifications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zell originally sold his <span class="companylink">Equity Office Properties</span> two years ago to private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> in a deal valued at $39 billion. Blackstone then resold many of the properties to numerous other buyers. Los Angeles-based <span class="companylink">Maguire Properties Inc</span>. and New York developer Harry Macklowe were among the buyers who have had to give buildings back to lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The RFR-owned portfolio holds a key chunk of the prime office space in Stamford, a suburban town about 45 minutes from Manhattan that is home to several large financial-services and manufacturing companies. Office vacancy is up to 14.7% in the third quarter, compared with 12.3% in the year-earlier period, according to Torto Wheaton Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vacancy in RFR's seven buildings has risen, according to CoStar Group, which tracks commercial-real-estate sales and leases nationwide. RFR says the buildings are more than 90% occupied and generating enough cash to pay debt service. They have signed 100,000 square feet of leases in the past two months, according to a person familiar with the properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosen and Mr. Fuchs were both born in Frankfurt to children of Holocaust survivors, and many of their deals are backed by German investors. The pair began as owners of rental apartments on the Upper East Side, but in the late 1990s began expanding into the office market. In 1998, RFR gained control of the landmark Lever House, and in 2000 it purchased the Seagram Building, a glass and bronze skyscraper designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson, paying $375 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosen also has emerged as a leading art-world figure. His collection includes work by Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, Jeff Koons and Richard Prince. Openings at his Lever House Art Collection exhibitions have drawn wide acclaim. He just opened a new restaurant in the building, Casa Lever, where Madonna recently attended a dinner honoring director Pedro Almodovar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stamford isn't Mr. Rosen's only challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, lenders ING Real Estate Finance and <span class="companylink">Swedbank AB</span>, sued Mr. Rosen and Mr. Fuchs for repayment of a $145 million hotel-construction loan that they personally guaranteed as part of a foreclosure action against the New York City project, known as the Shangri-La. RFR said the suit is of "no concern." ING didn't respond to a request to comment.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Korea has been one of the first large economies to bounce back from the global financial crisis. It is also one of the few places in the world where real-estate prices are actually going up rather than down. Not only that, but the rate of increase is also quite notable. That pattern will sound familiar after what happened in the U.S. in the years leading up to the crisis. Is Korea in danger of suffering its own bubble? Perhaps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year alone, property prices in Seoul increased by about 20%, a stark contrast to the virtual freefall in housing prices experienced in many other nations. Such numbers rival or exceed the property price increases seen during the recent U.S. housing bubble period. And in some neighborhoods, particularly in Seoul, the price run-up is even more startling. One area has seen prices rise 60%. Seoul has experienced only two similar one-year booms in the past two decades -- in 1990 (24.2% year-on-year rise) and 2002 (22.5% year-on-year rise). Such rapid growth rates were followed by dramatic price declines of over 26% and 15% respectively in the years directly following those booms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors explain this phenomenon. The changing structure of Korean households is leading to a long-term upward trend in demand and prices. Whereas one home used to house three generations of a family -- grandparents, parents and children -- over time, the culture has shifted toward two-generation households as newly married couples have moved out of their parents' houses to raise their young families. Lately, Korea also has seen an increase in the number of "one-generation" households composed of single, young adults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This expands the number of residences that a typical family would require to three from one, and that increased demand filters through to prices. Rental rates in Seoul are the highest in over a year, which has further pushed demand higher for housing, leading to increases for purchase prices too. The demolition of older housing to clear sites for "new towns" and other developments has also left thousands of former tenants on the housing market before the new supply becomes available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some eerie echoes of the U.S. subprime mania as well. The first sign of trouble is the general consumer confidence that real-estate prices will go up. A recent Bank of Korea consumer survey index for housing found the highest level of optimism since the survey started a year ago. Purchasers of Korean real estate have a sense that a broader economic recovery is underway. This is the same psychology that influenced so many bad decisions by American homebuyers in 2005 and 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Koreans today also have benefited from cheap credit. The Bank of Korea's decision on Friday to hold interest rates steady at 2% means that interest rates have hovered at the same historically low rate for the past eight months. Most mortgages feature a fixed rate for the first few years before it converts to a floating rate. While mortgage payments today look relatively affordable, when interest rates begin to hike up, Korea's first-time mortgage borrowers are likely to feel the pain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, Koreans perceive a lack of other investment opportunities domestically and internationally. Real estate has historically been the main domestic investment option for most Koreans. And given the weakness in the value of the Korean won vis-a-vis the dollar and other currencies for most of this year, foreign investments seemed like a worse deal than domestic real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This combination of factors presents a complex challenge for policy makers. Over the longer term, the government of President Lee Myung-bak is making substantial efforts to increase the housing supply. The rezoning of former "greenbelt" areas in and around Seoul where development used to be barred, for instance, will make more land available for development. And last week, in an effort to help curb real-estate prices, the Financial Supervisory Service changed the required loan-to-value ratio for new mortgages by insurance companies to 50% from 40% and nonbanking institutions to 60% from 70% for most new apartment purchases in the Seoul area. The debt-to-income restriction level range of between 40% to 55% that were originally applied only to designated "speculation zones" (located in southern Seoul) for banking institutions have now been applied to all districts of Seoul. Yet new supply will take years to come online. And despite the regulatory changes, prices have yet to fully stabilize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile there is a great danger that when interest rates inevitably rise, the Korean housing market will pop. To minimize the damage, policy makers must continue their efforts to recalibrate acceptable loan- and debt-to-income ratios, ensure greater disclosure provisions in mortgage agreements so that borrowers better understand the impact of possible interest-rate fluctuationson their monthly payments, and provide specific statements that more clearly warn that rates must inevitably go up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A collapse in Korea's real-estate market would not ripple as widely abroad as the U.S. subprime meltdown has done. But it would still be a significant problem for Korean households and for an economy that currently seems to be on track for a recovery. Seoul needs to avoid America's mistakes and act sooner to prick this bubble, before homebuyers are forced into confronting the painful reality that house prices aren't as "real" as they thought.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market's long decline has left once-thriving real-estate professionals scrambling for supplemental income or changing professions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors, agents, brokers and builders rely on sales and commissions for most of their income. And their incomes plunged as sales of existing homes fell 13.3% to 4.9 million last year from 7.1 million in 2005, the most recent peak. The National Association of Realtors says median income for Realtors and brokers fell to $36,700 last year from a high of $49,300 in 2004. The group's membership fell to 1.14 million in September from 1.35 million in September 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andy Reisinger was caught in the downturn. After eight years in real estate, Mr. Reisinger, 36 years old, was laid off in January 2008 as a sales manager for a Coldwell Banker office in Lehigh Acres, Fla. He quickly learned other real-estate jobs were scarce. The Bureau of Labor Statistics counted 310,100 employees in real-estate offices in August, down 17% from August 2007. The figure excludes most agents, who are self-employed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So he looked into law enforcement, and in April 2008, he became a deputy sheriff in Lee County, Fla. His pay fell to $35,000 annually, from $75,000 at Coldwell Banker. But he is satisfied with the trade because he now has health insurance and a pension, neither of which came with his real-estate job. He is also saving on expenses such as brokerage and licensing fees and insurance. Plus, he enjoys the excitement of being a sheriff. Mr. Reisinger views the housing slump as a blessing in disguise. "I'm happy that it happened because it gave me the opportunity to do something different," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida agents, near the heart of the real-estate boom and bust, are suffering more than most. Membership in the Florida Association of Realtors is down 29% since 2006, although the number of Realtors could change by year-end. Eileen McVeigh, broker owner of Re/Max Coastal Real Estate in Ponte Vedra, Fla., has 19 independent-contractor agents, down from 37 two years ago. Ms. McVeigh says some left for other jobs as sales declined. Among those remaining, she says, some have taken on second jobs in retail and construction to bolster their incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walter Molony, NAR spokesman, says Realtors traditionally dabbled in appraisals, commercial real-estate insurance and title insurance to carry them through slow months. But this downturn has been unusually long, and many of those related fields are suffering along with home sales, forcing many agents to consider other options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently Jill Galloway, 49, worked solely as a Realtor with Hilton &amp;Hyland in Beverly Hills, Calif. Since 2002, Ms. Galloway has specialized in residential real estate in the affluent Hancock Park and Hollywood Hills areas. Last winter, she realized that real-estate sales wouldn't be enough to support herself and two children, ages 16 and 11. Ms. Galloway didn't sell a home from January through July. "It became crushingly apparent that I couldn't pretend anymore that all of my clients were sitting on the fence," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her only income came from sporadic leasing deals, forcing her to dip repeatedly into retirement savings. She estimates her earnings this year will fall at least 60% from the $200,000 to $250,000 in a typical year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, Ms. Galloway and a friend opened a women's store in downtown Los Angeles, selling samples and overruns given to them by showrooms; when an item sells, the women pay the showroom and keep the mark-up. They don't pay rent because the landlord, with other vacant shops, just wants the store occupied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not a major income stream, but I do see some cash flow and a way to cross-promote" her real-estate business, she says.She says any face time with new people can turn into a prospective business deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Galloway is also exploring a frozen-yogurt franchise with her brother in New Orleans, but says she still considers herself primarily a Realtor. "I'm a real-estate agent 24 hours a day, everywhere I go, there's always the opportunity for me to find a client or property," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Springfield, Va., Patrice Moore also is venturing outside real estate. Ms. Moore, 54, says four recent deals fell through as prospective buyers backed out when they couldn't find the deals they were expecting to see on the market. One client stopped looking after she had worked with him for six months. After five years of consistent six-figure incomes, she expects her income to fall by half this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, Ms. Moore began searching for a part-time job and landed a position with a friend's ethics-consulting company. She earns $25 an hour, plus benefits she wasn't getting as a Realtor, like health care and a 401(k) plan. She says the position gives her some financial peace of mind and is helping her brush up on skills outside of real estate. "I consider myself a full-time Realtor, and I do the [consulting] work part-time, but there's an argument to be made that I'm a full-time employee doing real estate part time," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders, too, are being forced to look elsewhere for income. The National Association of Home Builders projects 572,000 housing starts for 2009, down from 1.8 million in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Kaminsky, owner of Carson Country Construction, a custom-home builder in Carson City, Nev., has felt the pain. He says his income is down at least 80% from three years ago. So he istaking on remodels, additions and repair projects."Almost any job will do," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his wife, Ann, who is a co-owner, have trimmed household expenses and taken on part-time jobs outside of construction. Ms. Kaminskytemporarilyworked at a day-care center.Next spring, Mr. Kaminsky plans on teaching construction-management courses at Western Nevada College. "I need an income and there isn't enough work out there," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recruiters say real-estate workers typically have transferable skills. Those with backgrounds in acquisition or development might consider renewable-energy fields such as wind or solar, says Deb Barbanel, managing director and co-lead of real estate in the Americas for executive-recruiters <span class="companylink">Russell Reynolds Associates</span>. People with financial skills, such as mortgage brokersand loan originators,are flocking to the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. and other government agencies, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Barbanel says real-estate veterans can get a leg up in the job search by mining their extensive contacts. "They build strong relationships and can take those skill sets into other areas where relationships are tantamount to success like sales and marketing," she says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jasper Kim   </div><div>951 words</div><div>12 October 2009</div><div>20:58</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Korea has been one of the first large economies to bounce back from the global financial crisis. It is also one of the few places in the world where real-estate prices are actually going up rather than down. Not only that, but the rate of increase is also quite notable. That pattern will sound familiar after what happened in the U.S. in the years leading up to the crisis. Is Korea in danger of suffering its own bubble? Perhaps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year alone, property prices in Seoul increased by about 20%, a stark contrast to the virtual freefall in housing prices experienced in many other nations. Such numbers rival or exceed the property price increases seen during the recent U.S. housing bubble period. And in some neighborhoods, particularly in Seoul, the price run-up is even more startling. One area has seen prices rise 60%. Seoul has experienced only two similar one-year booms in the past two decades—in 1990 (24.2% year-on-year rise) and 2002 (22.5% year-on-year rise). Such rapid growth rates were followed by dramatic price declines of over 26% and 15% respectively in the years directly following those booms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors explain this phenomenon. The changing structure of Korean households is leading to a long-term upward trend in demand and prices. Whereas one home used to house three generations of a family—grandparents, parents and children—over time, the culture has shifted toward two-generation households as newly married couples have moved out of their parents' houses to raise their young families. Lately, Korea also has seen an increase in the number of "one-generation" households composed of single, young adults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This expands the number of residences that a typical family would require to three from one, and that increased demand filters through to prices. Rental rates in Seoul are the highest in over a year, which has further pushed demand higher for housing, leading to increases for purchase prices too. The demolition of older housing to clear sites for "new towns" and other developments has also left thousands of former tenants on the housing market before the new supply becomes available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some eerie echoes of the U.S. subprime mania as well. The first sign of trouble is the general consumer confidence that real-estate prices will go up. A recent Bank of Korea consumer survey index for housing found the highest level of optimism since the survey started a year ago. Purchasers of Korean real estate have a sense that a broader economic recovery is underway. This is the same psychology that influenced so many bad decisions by American homebuyers in 2005 and 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Koreans today also have benefited from cheap credit. The Bank of Korea's decision on Friday to hold interest rates steady at 2% means that interest rates have hovered at the same historically low rate for the past eight months. Most mortgages feature a fixed rate for the first few years before it converts to a floating rate. While mortgage payments today look relatively affordable, when interest rates begin to hike up, Korea's first-time mortgage borrowers are likely to feel the pain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, Koreans perceive a lack of other investment opportunities domestically and internationally. Real estate has historically been the main domestic investment option for most Koreans. And given the weakness in the value of the Korean won vis-à-vis the dollar and other currencies for most of this year, foreign investments seemed like a worse deal than domestic real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This combination of factors presents a complex challenge for policy makers. Over the longer term, the government of President Lee Myung-bak is making substantial efforts to increase the housing supply. The rezoning of former "greenbelt" areas in and around Seoul where development used to be barred, for instance, will make more land available for development. And last week, in an effort to help curb real-estate prices, the Financial Supervisory Service changed the required loan-to-value ratio for new mortgages by insurance companies to 50% from 40% and nonbanking institutions to 60% from 70% for most new apartment purchases in the Seoul area. The debt-to-income restriction level range of between 40% to 55% that were originally applied only to designated "speculation zones" (located in southern Seoul) for banking institutions have now been applied to all districts of Seoul. Yet new supply will take years to come online. And despite the regulatory changes, prices have yet to fully stabilize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile there is a great danger that when interest rates inevitably rise, the Korean housing market will pop. To minimize the damage, policy makers must continue their efforts to recalibrate acceptable loan- and debt-to-income ratios, ensure greater disclosure provisions in mortgage agreements so that borrowers better understand the impact of possible interest-rate fluctuations on their monthly payments, and provide specific statements that more clearly warn that rates must inevitably go up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A collapse in Korea's real-estate market would not ripple as widely abroad as the U.S. subprime meltdown has done. But it would still be a significant problem for Korean households and for an economy that currently seems to be on track for a recovery. Seoul needs to avoid America's mistakes and act sooner to prick this bubble, before homebuyers are forced into confronting the painful reality that house prices aren't as "real" as they thought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kim is an associate professor of law and finance at the Graduate School of International Studies of Ewha Women's University in Seoul.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Colliers CRE PLC</span>, a large European commercial property brokerage, is getting clobbered by declining revenue and is scrambling to raise new capital, a sign of how the slowdown in sales and leasing transactions is hurting real-estate service and brokerage businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colliers, the London-based European affiliate of Colliers International, on Tuesday reported a £9.5 million ($15.1 million) loss and 32% decline in revenue to £27 million for the first half of 2009. Colliers blamed the continued flow of red ink on the "virtual standstill in transactional activity" in property markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many of the property owners it serves, Colliers CRE has struggled to cut costs to make up for declining revenue and to raise cash to service looming debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company announced Tuesday that it will issue 100 million new ordinary shares and raise £20 million from a group of investors led by FirstService Real Estate Advisers, a unit of First Service Corp. FirstService will invest £8.9 million and will own 29.99% of Colliers CRE's enlarged share capital after the transaction. The rest of the shares will be taken up by institutional investors and pension funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FirstService, a Seattle-based property services company, will have two seats on the Colliers CRE board and will "invest heavily" in diversifying Colliers CRE's services for corporate clients. FirstService plans to use the company as a stepping stone for further expansion in Europe, according to Douglas Frye, FirstService chief executive and president of global operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of smaller players don't have the ability to provide the services that global customers need," Mr. Frye said. "Consolidation will continue because firms need capital or they need the services and a distribution system that a large corporation like ours can provide."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on revenue, Colliers CRE ranks ninth among European agents, an industry that is dominated by global players such as <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc</span>.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the 1980s, some of the U.K. agencies have sought growth by expanding outside their home market into the rest of Europe and into Asia and the U.S. But as the financial crisis hit, and global property markets collapsed, agencies began withdrawing from the hardest-hit markets outside the U.K., such as Spain, Russia, Eastern Europe and the U.S. King Sturge, for example, said this week that it is liquidating its Spanish business. More than 1,500 jobs have been shed among U.K. agencies alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downturn is prompting agencies to rethink their long-term plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DTZ's profits were decimated by the impact of the crisis; the company had to undergo a major restructuring.

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>643 words</div><div>6 October 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment vacancies hit their highest point since 1986, surging in cities from Raleigh, N.C., to Tacoma, Wash., as rising unemployment continued to chip away at demand during the traditionally strong summer rental months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. vacancy rate reached 7.8%, a 23-year high, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a New York real-estate research firm that tracks vacancies and rents in the top 79 U.S. markets. The rate is expected to climb further in the fall and winter, when rental demand is weaker, pushing vacancies to the highest levels since Reis began its count in 1980.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the air leaving the market is driving rents down, most sharply in markets that had been chugging along until a year ago, when unemployment accelerated, including Tacoma; San Jose, Calif.; and Orange County, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, Jennifer Hyman rented a one-bedroom apartment in July at a monthly rate of $1,950 -- down from $2,450 for the previous tenant -- when she returned to the city after graduating from Harvard Business School. Her first month's rent was free -- and her landlord painted the apartment, scrubbed the floors and added window coverings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The experience was night-and-day different from before," says Ms. Hyman, who had rented other Manhattan apartments between 2002 and 2007, each time paying a brokers' fee and feeling pressured to sign a lease the minute she found an apartment. Now, she says, "Renters are the ones with the power."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving the change is the troubled employment market, which is closely tied to rentals. With unemployment at 9.8% -- a 26-year high -- more would-be renters are doubling up or moving in with family and friends during periods of job loss. Landlords have been particularly battered because unemployment has been higher among workers under 35 years old, who are more likely to rent. Nationally, effective rents have fallen by 2.7% over the past year, to around $972.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When job losses stop, rents will firm and occupancies will firm," says Richard Campo, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Camden Property Trust</span>, a Houston-based real-estate company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second and third quarters typically are the strongest periods for rental landlords because they are popular times for people to move. But this year, "vacancies just continued rising," says Victor Calanog, director of research for Reis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the third quarter, vacancies increased in 42 markets, improved in 26 markets and remained unchanged in 11 markets. Omaha, Neb., saw the largest rise in vacancies, with the rate rising 1.1 percentage points to 7.4%. Other big rises were seen in Memphis, Tenn., Indianapolis, Raleigh and Tacoma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deteriorating rental market comes amid some signs of stabilization in the housing sales market. An $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers and investor demand helped to boost sales of low- and moderately priced homes this summer. But some analysts warn demand could fall with the expiration of the tax credit and supply could increase with more foreclosed homes hitting the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a housing recovery could lead the best quality renters to move out and purchase homes, the move-out rate isn't expected to surpass levels seen during the housing boom earlier this decade. Mortgage credit standards have tightened considerably since then, which should keep more renters in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment owners ultimately could gain from the housing bust because the U.S. home-ownership rate has fallen as foreclosures rise. But the housing bust has also flooded some of the most overbuilt housing markets with new apartment inventory as developers have converted unsold condominium developments into rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reis projects that the vacancy rate will peak at well above 8% in mid-2010.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Dawn Wotapka   </div><div>882 words</div><div>6 October 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders are scaling back on the incentives offered to attract buyers, putting an end to such freebies as sports cars and tropical vacations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With new-home inventory falling as home sales in many markets pick up, builders say they no longer need to offer eye-popping inducements to move homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't know of any examples, at least in our system, where we're offering the kind of huge incentives that were being offered two or three years ago," said Brent Anderson, vice president of investor relations for <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>., based in Scottsdale, Ariz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, Meritage offered shoppers at its Valley Vista community in northern Phoenix $60,000 of incentives, including a free pool, gourmet kitchen or a reduction of the $349,000 ticket price, for a three-bedroom home with two-and-a-half baths. But the company is now building smaller, simpler houses that sell for about $245,000. Today's buyers are more likely to get Meritage to pay their closing costs, worth about 6% of the closing price, or about $15,000 at Valley Vista.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders acknowledge that incentives are a part of doing business and they will never disappear completely. And the moves to cut back could be reversed if home sales stall again, which some housing analysts and economists are forecasting. These pessimists warn that new-home sales could slow when the $8,000 federal tax credit for qualified first-time buyers expires later this year or when a possible wave of foreclosed homes hits the market, which will compete with new homes for buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the time being, the pullback in construction and the reduction in inventory means more builders can sell homes without cutting as deeply into their profit margins. According to Jeffrey Laverty, an analyst with independent research firm <span class="companylink">Oscar Gruss &amp; Son</span>, single-family home supply whittled from 570,000 at the 2005 peak to 261,000 as of August. Supply, meanwhile, has fallen from 12.4 months in January to 7.3 in August, nearing the six-month mark considered a healthy balance between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the housing boom, incentives weren't really needed. Loose lending standards fed what seemed to be insatiable demand. With buyers willing to pay more, builders added square footage and tacked on profitable incentives, helping boost the gross margin to an average of 26.2% in 2005 -- nearly double current rate, according to <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> analyst Susan Berliner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the housing bust, builders were stuck with a bloated supply of oversized and overpriced houses. They initially resisted price cuts, fearful of angering current owners who paid boom-time prices. Instead, builders moved to incentives that helped to mask pricing discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sector then resorted to slashing prices to move completed-but-unsold homes and get cash in the door. About two years ago, <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>. offered the 72-hour "Deal of the Century," shaving six figures off some home prices. In California, some neighborhoods from San Diego to Bakersfield -- one of the markets hardest-hit by the downturn -- carried incentives valued at as much as $100,000, plus other upgrades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the market deteriorated further at the end of 2008 and into early 2009, builders offered anywhere from 15% to 25% of the sales price in incentives, said Mollie Carmichael, senior vice president of John Burns Real Estate Consulting. Currently, the average ranges between 5% and 10% of the sales price depending on the area. And more often, incentives include offers of closing costs and reduced interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, luxury builder <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. earlier this year offered buyers a fixed rate of 3.99% on 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., one of the nation's largest builders, went further with 3.625%. It is currently touting 3.99% on its Web site, a slightly higher rate, but one below the current average of 5.13% for a 30-year fixed loan below $417,000, according to mortgage-market analyst HSH Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To offer lower mortgage rates, builders make upfront cash payments to mortgage companies, a process known as a "buy down." On a $200,000 loan, it typically costs about $8,000 to buy down the mortgage rate by a full percentage point on a 30-year mortgage. Homeowners often make similar payments, known as points, to obtain a lower interest rate. For the builder, the buy-down is treated as a cost of sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But gone are the days when Lennar was offering vouchers for a Ford Mustang in some Florida communities, something it tried in 2006. Hovnanian, meanwhile, says its "Deal of the Century" won't be repeated. The current "Pounce Before the Bounce" campaign urges buyers to act before the market recovers and prices climb, offering specials including lower mortgage rates and discounts on options and upgrades. Deals are now customized to move specific floor plans or lots, instead of a sweeping price reduction or promotion communitywide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The incentives certainly aren't crazy," said Laura VanVelthoven, Hovnanian's corporate vice president of marketing and sales. "They're incentives that make sense."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders are scaling back on the incentives offered to attract buyers, putting an end to such freebies as sports cars and tropical vacations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With new-home inventory falling as home sales in many markets pick up, builders say they no longer need to offer eye-popping inducements to move homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't know of any examples, at least in our system, where we're offering the kind of huge incentives that were being offered two or three years ago," said Brent Anderson, vice president of investor relations for <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>., based in Scottsdale, Ariz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, Meritage offered shoppers at its Valley Vista community in northern Phoenix $60,000 of incentives, including a free pool, gourmet kitchen or a reduction of the $349,000 ticket price, for a three-bedroom home with two-and-a-half baths. But the company is now building smaller, simpler houses that sell for about $245,000. Today's buyers are more likely to get Meritage to pay their closing costs, worth about 6% of the closing price, or about $15,000 at Valley Vista.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders acknowledge that incentives are a part of doing business and they will never disappear completely. And the moves to cut back could be reversed if home sales stall again, which some housing analysts and economists are forecasting. These pessimists warn that new-home sales could slow when the $8,000 federal tax credit for qualified first-time buyers expires later this year or when a possible wave of foreclosed homes hits the market, which will compete with new homes for buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the time being, the pullback in construction and the reduction in inventory means more builders can sell homes without cutting as deeply into their profit margins. According to Jeffrey Laverty, an analyst with independent research firm Oscar Gruss &amp;Son, single-family home supply whittled from 570,000 at the 2005 peak to 261,000 as of August. Supply, meanwhile, has fallen from 12.4 months in January to 7.3 in August, nearing the six-month mark considered a healthy balance between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the housing boom, incentives weren't really needed. Loose lending standards fed what seemed to be insatiable demand. With buyers willing to pay more, builders added square footage and tacked on profitable incentives, helping boost the gross margin to an average of 26.2% in 2005 -- nearly double current rate, according to <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> analyst Susan Berliner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the housing bust, builders were stuck with a bloated supply of oversized and overpriced houses. They initially resisted price cuts, fearful of angering current owners who paid boom-time prices. Instead, builders moved to incentives that helped to mask pricing discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sector then resorted to slashing prices to move completed-but-unsold homes and get cash in the door. About two years ago, <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>. offered the 72-hour "Deal of the Century," shaving six figures off some home prices. In California, some neighborhoods from San Diego to Bakersfield -- one of the markets hardest-hit by the downturn -- carried incentives valued at as much as $100,000, plus other upgrades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the market deteriorated further at the end of 2008 and into early 2009, builders offered anywhere from 15% to 25% of the sales price in incentives, said Mollie Carmichael, senior vice president of John Burns Real Estate Consulting. Currently, the average ranges between 5% and 10% of the sales price depending on the area. And more often, incentives include offers of closing costs and reduced interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, luxury builder <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. earlier this year offered buyers a fixed rate of 3.99% on 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., one of the nation's largest builders, went further with 3.625%. It is currently touting 3.99% on its Web site, a slightly higher rate, but one below the current average of 5.13% for a 30-year fixed loan below $417,000, according to mortgage-market analyst HSH Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To offer lower mortgage rates, builders make upfront cash payments to mortgage companies, a process known as a "buy down." On a $200,000 loan, it typically costs about $8,000 to buy down the mortgage rate by a full percentage point on a 30-year mortgage. Homeowners often make similar payments, known as points, to obtain a lower interest rate. For the builder, the buy-down is treated as a cost of sale.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Shefali Anand </div><div>1725 words</div><div>5 October 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>R9</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Individuals looking to dip their toes into real-estate securities should consider buying a mutual fund that invests both in the U.S. and abroad, says Dave Yeske, a financial planner in San Francisco. When buying risky assets like real estate, it's best to spread your bets across companies and countries, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't believe investing solely in the U.S. gives us enough diversification," says Mr. Yeske. Since late July, he has been buying a global real-estate fund for clients, to which he dedicates 4% to 6% of their portfolios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this column, we ask prominent financial advisers who use mutual funds and exchange-traded funds to share model portfolios with us. Mr. Yeske, 52 years old, founded financial-planning firm Yeske &amp;Co. in 1990 and last year merged it with Financial Planning Group of Vienna, Va., to form Yeske Buie. Mr. Yeske is a former chairman of the Financial Planning Association and is an instructor of financial planning at Golden Gate University in San Francisco. Yeske Buie manages about $300 million for some 200 clients, primarily individuals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late 2006, Mr. Yeske sold U.S. real-estate securities held by his clients, after they had nearly tripled in price. "It was seeming very expensive," he says. Since the bust in the housing market that began in 2007, these securities have fallen dramatically. The MSCI U.S. REIT Index, an index of real-estate investment trusts, lost 38% in 2008, following a 17% decline in 2007. The market has come back this year, with the MSCI index up about 13% through Oct. 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs are entities that invest in different kinds of real estate or real-estate-related assets, including shopping centers, office buildings, hotels, and mortgages secured by real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite this year's rebound, many investors and advisers remain cautious on real estate, fearing that there could be further declines. In the U.S., for instance, it's not clear yet that the housing market has bottomed, and the commercial real-estate market is still deteriorating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It might have further to fall, I don't know," says Mr. Yeske. But given the low prices after the market's decline, he says he feels comfortable buying now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, he notes that in the past few years a number of funds have popped up that invest in both U.S. and foreign real estate, giving him more global choices. Indeed, two-thirds of the 30-odd global real-estate mutual funds on the market now were launched after 2006, according to fund research firm <span class="companylink">Morningstar Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To decide which investments to buy for clients and how to manage them, Mr. Yeske relies heavily on academic research. "We won't do anything that's not grounded in science," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One investing tenet that Mr. Yeske followed throughout the market downturn is rebalancing. Essentially, this involves adding money to investments that are losing value while selling those that are doing well. Since most asset classes were losing value last year, Mr. Yeske typically was adding to those investments that were losing more than others, mostly stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was in contrast to some other advisers, who held off buying stocks last year because they feared further declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around two years ago, Mr. Yeske tweaked his approach, and started rebalancing only when an asset class moves 20% away from its target allocation, as opposed to the more commonly used range of 10%, to avoid too much short-term trading. "Look frequently but trade infrequently," says Mr. Yeske, who usually looks at the value of client portfolios every two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since last year, Mr. Yeske has rebalanced client portfolios four times, including the most recent round in August. Last fall and earlier this year, he was buying small stocks and "value" stocks, which are considered cheap based on prices and earnings. He notes that since the market bottom on March 9, large-cap value and small-company stocks have risen more than some of the other stock classes, such as fast-growing or "growth" companies. From March 9 through Oct. 1, for instance, the Russell 1000 Value Index rose 59%, versus 49% for the Russell 1000 Growth Index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here Mr. Yeske shares a model portfolio for clients in retirement, who make up a third of his firm's clientele. A typical client with this type of portfolio has earned a return of 26% since the beginning of the year, following a decline of 36% last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. STOCKS: The portfolio's 33% U.S.-stock allocation is invested mostly in value stocks and small stocks. That's based on studies by economists Eugene Fama and Kenneth French that concluded that over long periods, value stocks tend to have better returns than growth companies. These studies also show that small stocks, which are riskier than large-company stocks, tend to outperform the latter over the long run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make these and other investments, Mr. Yeske and his team rely primarily on funds offered by Dimensional Fund Advisors Inc. DFA uses computer models to identify securities to buy within certain parameters, such as small value stocks. Its investing philosophy is based on Fama-French research, so a number of DFA funds are biased toward value and small stocks. The funds' turnover and trading costs are typically quite low, like those of index-tracking funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"DFA [funds] represent the best blend of both passive and active," says Mr. Yeske.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When creating client portfolios, Mr. Yeske typically starts by using a fund that provides broad stock-market exposure and then adds funds that focus on value stocks. So for allocation to large stocks, he invests 7% of assets each in the <span class="companylink">iShares S&amp;P 500</span> Index ETF, tracking the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500-stock index, and DFA U.S. Large Cap Value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For an allocation of 5% to medium-size companies, Mr. Yeske uses the <span class="companylink">iShares Russell Midcap Value Index</span> ETF. Finally, 7% each is invested in DFA U.S. Small Cap Value and DFA U.S. Micro Cap. "Small caps exhibit higher returns in the long term; in the short term, they provide diversification benefit," says Mr. Yeske.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOREIGN STOCKS: In recent months, Yeske Buie advisers have increased the portfolio's allocation to foreign stocks, to make it equal to the U.S.-stock allocation of 33%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The advisers say there's no evidence to show that there's any benefit in investing more money in one region of the world than another. "Those kind of judgment calls are wrong as much as they're right," says Mr. Yeske. By keeping their geographic allocation neutral, he says, they are able to draw from a broader universe of value and small-company stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the U.S. allocation, the foreign portion is tilted toward value and small stocks. There is a 7% allocation to the Vanguard Total International Stock Index fund, which invests in stocks around the world and provides the portfolio's only exposure to emerging markets like China and India. Another 7% is dedicated to DFA International Value, which buys large-company value stocks of developed countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a 5% allocation to WisdomTree International MidCap Dividend, and 7% each goes to DFA International Small Company and DFA International Small Cap Value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BONDS: Last year, Mr. Yeske tapped only the portfolio's bond allocation, made up of high-quality bonds, to make withdrawals for retired clients. This kept them from being forced to sell stocks to meet their income needs. Mr. Yeske says he views the fixed-income allocation as "our stable reserve."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 30% bond allocation is dedicated to mutual funds that invest in short- to medium-term bonds. The longer a bond's maturity, the more it fluctuates in price for a given change in interest rates. And the yields on those longer-dated bonds may not be much higher than those on the short- or medium-term ones. "When you get beyond five years, you get a lot of volatility and very little additional returns," sums up Mr. Yeske.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He splits the allocation equally among three DFA funds, which invest in high-quality bonds of various types, including mortgage-related bonds and corporate bonds. DFA One-Year Fixed Income aims to provide stable returns in excess of inflation. DFA Short-Term Extended Quality dips a little lower in the quality spectrum of bonds, but its average bond quality is still investment-grade. Finally, DFA Five-Year Global Fixed Income invests both in the U.S. and abroad, and can also hedge against currency fluctuations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until some months ago, Mr. Yeske owned two Pimco funds for his bond allocation, with expenses of 0.45% or more. In comparison, DFA's bond funds charge 0.28% or less, so the advisers decided to shift to the lower-cost alternative. Costs are "one of the few things that you can control," says Mr. Yeske, who firmly believes they should be kept to a minimum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REAL-ESTATE SHARES: Like many advisers, Mr. Yeske believes that real-estate investments can help diversify a portfolio because they perform differently than other investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While in 2008 this was not so much the case, because most asset classes were losing value at the same time, Mr. Yeske notes that during the bear market for stocks in 2000 and 2001, real estate was one of the few investments that held up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, he says that assets are rarely totally uncorrelated. "The only choice that's available to you is assets that are relatively uncorrelated," says Mr. Yeske. Even last year, he notes, some asset classes were losing more value than others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His 4% allocation to real estate is through DFA Global Real Estate Securities, a fund of funds that invests in a U.S. and an international real-estate fund offered by DFA. The underlying funds own REITs and companies considered to be REIT-like entities in various countries, including emerging markets.</p>

</div><div class="author">Edited by Nikki Waller </div><div>979 words</div><div>4 October 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Sunday</div><div>SNJR</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic downturn has caused many 401(k) participants to take drastic measures with their retirement accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About one in seven cashes out of a plan after a job change or loss and doesn't roll the money into a new account, takes hardship withdrawals, or borrows against his or her portfolio, according to a new report from the Government Accountability Office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GAO study says Congress should consider changing a rule that prohibits 401(k) participants from making additional contributions for six months after a hardship withdrawal. That suspension also includes employer matches. The GAO says the requirement may worsen the problem of early withdrawals "by barring otherwise able participants from contributing to their accounts."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the GAO says the Labor Department should encourage employers to give workers "understandable and useful information" about the long-term consequences of hardship withdrawals, loans and cash-outs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GAO also says the Treasury Department should clarify 401(k) regulations that require participants to exhaust all available loans before resorting to hardship withdrawals that subject workers to taxes and early-withdrawal penalties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, completed in August, takes particular aim at cash-outs, which, it says, can be "the most damaging form of 401(k) leakage," is the least regulated and runs "counter to the goal of retirement savings." (In a cash-out, the money isn't rolled over to another retirement account.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash-outs of any amount -- partially or in full -- can affect a participant's account balance at age 65 more than comparable amounts taken either in a hardship withdrawal or a loan, the GAO says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, a participant who cashed out his entire 401(k) account of $37,000 at age 35 would forfeit more than $183,000 in savings by his 65th birthday, based on his annual contributions and investment returns. Cashing out later in a career, when there is less time to recover from losses, can also leave a big wealth gap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet many participants choose to cash out of a plan when they leave a job, in part because they aren't aware of the potential hit to their finances.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hastening a Home Buy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most house hunters spend months juggling numbers like mortgage rates, list prices and broker fees. But with the $8,000 federal tax credit for first-time home buyers expiring Nov. 30, would-be homeowners will need to expedite if they want to take advantage of a real-estate market on the mend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the current housing market, it takes about 45 to 60 days to close on a home from the time you have an accepted offer. Buyers should have their offer accepted no later than mid-October if they're trying to make the Nov. 30 deadline. (Several bills have been introduced in Congress to extend the credit by six months to give the real-estate market another boost, though they are still up for debate.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying a home is neither quick nor easy, but here are strategies to hasten a closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be liquid: When it's time to make a down payment, home buyers should make sure they have enough cash available, and not tied up in a stock portfolio, 401(k) plan or other investment where getting access to the money could be delayed. Using gift money for a down payment is another potential snag, because the lender needs a paper trail to track the money's origin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forget about short sales: These are attractive from a price standpoint, but they can take months to close. When you make an offer on a short sale, not only does the seller have to accept the offer, but the bank also must accept and approve it -- and that can take a while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No big buys: Big purchases on a credit card before closing can trigger concern because a buyer's debt-to-income ratio is what lenders use to determine how much they will lend. Once you enter into the loan application process, you don't want to go over the lender's ratio. Any increase in credit-card debt can come under scrutiny from a lender, who may be looking at buyers' credit reports until the day of the closing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Selling the Family Plot</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As if the recession hasn't ruined enough people's plans in this life, it seems to be disrupting the hereafter as well. Cemeteries and funeral-property Web sites report a burgeoning marketplace for the sale of burial plots by individuals, who are liquidating their plots to make ends meet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Orlando, Fla., Greenwood Cemetery has seen a record number of customers coming in to sell their plots back to the municipal facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don Price, the cemetery's manager, had 44 "buybacks" in the first six months of this year, up from 42 in all of last year and only 11 five years ago. Web sites such as GraveSolutions.com and PlotBrokers.com, which advertise spaces and broker sales of cemetery properties, have also seen an uptick in postings. Caskets-N-More, in Glendora, Calif., sells funeral products and brokers sales of cemetery properties, reports a doubling of people wanting to sell their plots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so much inventory on the market, it could be a great time for a consumer to buy. Generally, sellers post plots for about half of what a comparable one would retail for at the cemetery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plots sell quickest in places where people tend to retire -- such as Florida, Arizona, Texas and Southern California -- according to Ken Brant, who runs the Grave Solutions Web site.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty </div><div>451 words</div><div>2 October 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An expansion of manufacturing activity, growth in consumer spending and improved home sales indicated Thursday that the U.S. economy is on the mend. But amid a consumer rebound driven largely by tax breaks and government programs, it remained to be seen if a recovery will continue in the absence of federal help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers may have a hard time if unemployment remains high and incomes don't grow. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told the House Financial Services Committee that even if the economy grows at a 3% pace -- the fastest in two years -- unemployment would still be above 9% at the end of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke's remarks came amid a slew of largely positive economic data. The Institute for Supply Management, a group of purchasing managers, reported that its index of manufacturing activity was at 52.6 in September, down from 52.9 a month earlier but still reflecting an expansion for the second consecutive month. Any reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing activity; below 50 is contraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign of a broadening recovery, the ISM report showed growth in 13 of the 18 manufacturing industries it measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventories index increased to 42.5 from 34.4 -- still a contraction, but a sign that manufacturers may soon be restocking their shelves if orders continue to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending also showed growth. Personal income rose 0.2% in August compared with July, while spending increased by 1.3%, not adjusted for inflation, the Commerce Department said Thursday. About a third of the spending increase was from auto sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts wonder how long spending growth can continue in the absence of programs like cash for clunkers or extended unemployment benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department also said personal saving as a percentage of disposable income was 3%, compared with 4% in July. The rate, while positive, has declined three straight times since May, when it was 5.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government aid is also propping up the housing market. The National Association of Realtors' index for pending sales of previously owned homes increased 6.4% to 103.8 in August, from 97.6 in July, the seventh consecutive monthly increase. The Obama administration's $8,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers, due to expire Nov. 30, and lower home prices have brought buyers back into the market, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite improvement in the economy, employers remain skittish about hiring. Initial claims for unemployment insurance increased 17,000 to 551,000 in the week ending Sept. 26, on a seasonally adjusted basis.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ex-Yahoo President Decker</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pays $5.1 Million in California</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan Decker, who quit in January as president of <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> after the company hired Carol Bartz for the top job of chief executive officer, has paid $5.1 million for a waterfront home in Marin County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once viewed as a candidate to succeed Jerry Yang as CEO, Ms. Decker spent about two years as president after a successful run as chief financial officer. But her last year proved problematic: Among other things, she advised <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span>'s board to reject <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>'s acquisition offer, angering Wall Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two-story Belvedere, Calif., home, which Ms. Decker bought through a limited-liability company, sits at the tip of a lagoon on the Tiburon Peninsula and has five bedrooms and 5 1/2 baths. The property has a deck, yoga room and landscaped garden with small pond. The seller is Michael Chen, a retired Taiwanese businessman who built the roughly 4,500-square-foot home in 1994, replacing a house he'd purchased in 1989 for $1.27 million. Olivia Hsu Decker and Karen Plastiras of Decker Bullock <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> had the listing.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers are finding that the battered real-estate market offers just as many opportunities for headaches as for bargains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seth and Crystal Grotzke, both 25 years old, recently bought a bank-owned two-bedroom, two-bathroom townhouse in Edina, Minn., for $110,000 -- when similar homes in the same development were selling for as much as $131,000. But exactly one day before the scheduled July closing, the Grotzkes learned there was a second, unpaid mortgage. Because of the foul-up, the couple was forced to live in Mr. Grotzke's boss's basement for more than a month. They finally closed on Aug. 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We knew there would be title issues, but none that would last for that long," says Mr. Grotzke, an assistant pastor. He adds that buying a foreclosed property is a way for God to "teach you patience."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lots of home buyers are learning about patience these days. In August, nearly a third of overall housing sales were distress sales, according to the National Association of Realtors, up from 18% in March 2008, when it began tracking such sales. The figure includes both foreclosures and so-called short sales, in which the lender agrees to accept less than the full balance of a mortgage in order to unload the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some parts of the country, such as Bakersfield, Calif., Las Vegas and Lakeland, Fla., distressed properties constitute half or more of all sales. So far this year, there have been nearly 411,000 sales of U.S. properties in some stage of foreclosure, according to RealtyTrac, which publishes a national database of homes in default, auctions and bank-owned homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those numbers aren't making it any easier to buy distressed property. Bidding wars are erupting for the lowest-priced foreclosures. Experienced investors with cash are elbowing aside first-time buyers who need mortgages. And banks generally sell property "as is," without the defect disclosures required of other owners. Short-sale buyers, for their part, often face delays of weeks or months as they wait to hear back from lenders -- and from the institutional investors who bought securities based on the mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed-property buyers also often have to cope with the fallout from the ruined lives of previous owners, such as vandalized properties and liens from second mortgages, taxes, unpaid water bills, homeowner-association dues and court judgments. For all that, final sale prices often aren't significantly lower than average in some areas, because the foreclosure glut has also driven down prices for sellers who aren't in default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers have to be thoroughly prepared by securing financing in advance and making sure they have a strong stomach, experts say. They should seek out agents with extensive experience and training in distressed property because the transactions are often complicated and time-consuming. Pushing and prodding bank officials, loan servicers and others is a big part of the job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colin and Alisabeth Shearn of Cherry Hills Village, Colo., a Denver suburb, managed to snag a seven-bedroom Mediterranean-style house in a short sale for $1,272,000, more than $900,000 below its original listing price in 2007. By the time they bid on the house last February, it had gone unsold for nearly two years and the price had been reduced to $1.5 million from $2.2 million. The couple closed on the purchase at the end of May, and moved in with their two preschool-age children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was nerve-racking," says Mr. Shearn, 41, a university research scientist. There was a long delay hearing back from the seller's bank, and the last-minute discovery of a lien from an unpaid water bill -- the water was about to be shut off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the end, Mr. Shearn, says he and his wife, 42, a co-owner of a software company, were happy. "We really lucked out to find this house."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short sales like the Shearns' are particularly complicated. Lenders require detailed information about both buyers' and sellers' finances, and homeowners generally have to prove hardship. The entire package of documents is scrutinized not just by lenders but by the mortgage investors. Second- and third-lien holders frequently hold up transactions demanding a larger share of the settlement. The average transaction takes four to six months or more, agents say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders say they are stepping up their efforts to handle short sales. <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co</span>. has doubled the number of employees handling such sales, while <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. recently began allowing real-estate agents to submit short-sale documents online, reducing the chance a sale will be stalled. At <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp;Co</span>., efforts to speed up short sales helped produce a 145% increase in these transactions in August compared with the same month a year earlier, the bank says. Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors and other groups have recently launched short-sale and foreclosure certification programs for agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Treasury Department is expected to issue streamlined guidelines to lenders on short sales soon. Housing-industry leaders say complicated procedures are hindering them from clearing the large inventory of distressed property necessary to return the housing market to normal. Now, only about 20% or so of short sales are successful, according to real-estate brokerage Re/Max International Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying a foreclosure is usually speedier than a short sale because lenders already possess the property. But there are other drawbacks. State laws vary considerably with respect to legal procedures surrounding foreclosures. Many states require judicial proceedings for foreclosing on a home that can take more than 12 months, a period during which the home may be vacant or occupied by tenants or squatters. Homes may have appliances, pipes and even electrical wiring ripped out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers of bank-owned properties are usually stuck with whatever hidden problems they discover, including construction defects, and they seldom get additional price concessions. For these reasons, it's especially important for distressed-property buyers to have a thorough inspection by a qualified home inspector or inspection engineer, as well as a thorough title search and title insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the hurdles, competition for low-priced foreclosures under $300,000 is keen, sources say. "The bargain hunters have come out from everywhere, and they are getting into bidding wars," says Re/Max Chairman Dave Liniger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers must be prepared and ready to move on a dime. If they're paying cash, they have to certify they have the funds available. Those who need financing should obtain pre-approval from a lender before even looking at properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Successful foreclosure buyers often bid significantly above the asking price. Chuck Brueske, 46, a hospital biomedical technician, says he paid $111,000 in August to win a bank-owned townhouse built in 1981 in Maple Grove, Minn., listed at $99,600.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brueske says his own good credit history helped him win over two other bidders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was unusual that in a down, depressed market that I had to bid more than the asking price, but as it turned out the other bids were higher than mine," he says. "It took me a while to swallow that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some home buyers give up after discovering there are bargain properties without all the obstacles. Jerrold Horning, 34, an electronics technician for the U.S. government in El Cajon, Calif., says he and his wife bought a house in the conventional market after seeing the condition many houses were in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some of the foreclosures I looked at were horribly trashed. You would have to put another $100,000 in just to make it livable," he says. Of buying a distressed property for a primary home, he says, "I don't think it's worth the hassles."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi </div><div>836 words</div><div>30 September 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About two years ago, the owner of the Gallery at NoHo Commons was close to selling the apartment complex in the North Hollywood section of Los Angeles for more than $140 million, a person familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the 438-unit complex has sold for $96 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal is a sign of the drop in values in the multifamily sector which has seen vacancy rates rise as cost-conscious renters have doubled-up or moved in with family members. Sales of apartment complexes nationwide have slowed to a trickle. Some $27 billion in apartment buildings traded in 2008 compared with $55 billion in 2007, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a New York real-estate research firm, based on a survey of transactions valued at $2 million or greater. Through the second quarter of this year, there has been less than $5 billion in deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some investors have stayed behind as others have fled the sector and the sale of NoHo Commons gives a glimpse into their thinking. It was purchased by a nontraded real-estate investment trust managed by Behringer Harvard, a Dallas real-estate company. Behringer has become one of the biggest buyers of U.S. multifamily properties this year, buying five apartment complexes with 1,690 units for a total of about $274 million in cash and assumed debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behringer executives say they see opportunity in the downdraft, which has sent U.S. apartment prices from $113,000 in the third quarter of 2008, to $80,000 in the second quarter, Reis says. "Properties of a very high quality are available at pricing that really wasn't available a few years ago," says Jason Mattox, chief administrative officer at Behringer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behringer Harvard was formed in 2001 by Robert Behringer, 61 years old, who worked for a large pension-fund adviser before he started two real-estate companies that became predecessors to Behringer. Behringer now has about $8 billion in assets under management through its various nontraded REITs as well as through some private partnerships and other affiliates, according to Robert Aisner, president and co-chief operating officer of Behringer Harvard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The portfolio hasn't been immune to the downturn. For example, a Dallas condominium development by a Behringer-affiliated partnership converted the condo units to rentals about six months ago after they failed to sell quickly, Mr. Aisner says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behringer is able to go on a buying spree partly because it has been able to raise capital. Through early September, Behringer Harvard Multifamily REIT has raised about $249.2 million from a public offering begun in September 2008. It also has raised money in a private offering as well as about $200 million from Dutch pension fund PGGM. It also is taking advantage of financing still available for apartment acquisitions from <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Aisner says Behringer seeks to finance as much as 60% of the cost of its acquisitions, and will likely look to one of the housing-finance giants for a mortgage on the NoHo Commons complex for which it originally paid cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment buildings are clearly producing higher returns than they used to. In 2007, the so-called capitalization rates of apartment buildings, derived by dividing a building's net operating income by the price paid, were 5.8%. Today they have risen to 7.1%, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a New York real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NoHo apartment complex, which offers such amenities as a pool, fitness center and a room that it bills as a recording studio, fetches monthly rents in the $2,400 range for a two-bedroom unit and has an occupancy rate of 91%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment property was attractive because if it is financed it could ultimately throw off a rate of return of more than 8%, says Herb Chase, managing director of Multi Housing Capital Advisors who represented the seller in the Los Angeles complex sale. Opportunities for such higher returns in apartments have begun to attract some investors who previously retreated to other perceived safer investments such as Treasury bonds after the recession hit. "Everybody was scared but people are less scared now," Mr. Chase says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the outlook for apartment properties is likely to get worse before it gets better. U.S. apartment vacancies are expected to peak next year at 8.1%, a 30-year high, according to Reis. It could sour further if the economy worsens and rents and occupancy rates continue to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some people think a recovery for apartments is likely in 2011. If the job market stabilizes in 2010, younger workers are likely to be the first to be hired back because they are cheaper to employ, the theory goes. Since many of those people are renters, that is going to drive the apartment recovery, says Victor Calanog, director of research for Reis.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Deborah Solomon </div><div>1218 words</div><div>28 September 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is close to committing as much as $35 billion to help beleaguered state and local housing agencies continue to provide mortgages to low- and moderate-income families, according to administration officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move would further cement the government's role in propping up the housing market even as some lawmakers push to curb spending at a time of rising debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effort, which could be announced as early as this week, is aimed at relieving pressure on government-operated housing finance agencies, which have been struggling to find funding amid the downturn. These agencies, or HFAs, are a small part of the housing market but are critical to many first-time and low-income home buyers, who can get lower-rate mortgages through an HFA than they could through a private-sector lender. Rates are typically 0.5 to one percentage point lower than commercial lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Administration officials are concerned that HFAs have largely stopped making new loans, exacerbating the housing market's woes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Details are still being finalized. The plan requires formal approval from Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and the White House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program could be in place for as long as three years, and would involve the administration essentially buying the debt that these housing agencies rely on for financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury Department, along with government-controlled mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, is expected to buy as much as $20 billion of new housing bonds issued by the state agencies. It will also provide $15 billion in additional funding, as needed, to help the agencies continue to use a type of cheap, short-term financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the housing agencies default on their debt obligations, taxpayers could lose out. The Treasury plans to charge fees to agencies that want to sell new long-term bonds to the government based on their individual risk factors, to help reduce the risk of default and protect taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Money for the programs will come from <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and from the Treasury, using its authority under the 2008 Housing and Economic Recovery Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While policymakers are beginning to unwind some of the other emergency programs extended to financial markets during the financial crisis, housing remains a weak spot that some view as too fragile to survive without significant government backing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Barack Obama said in February his administration would find a way to help support state housing finance agencies. Such a move has been pressed by state and local politicians and by housing advocates. House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank, a vocal supporter of such housing initiatives, was the author of legislation earlier this year that closely mirrors the administration's plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effort could trigger criticism, particularly from Republicans, for aiming federal funds at low- and moderate-income homeowners instead of other troubled areas, such as small businesses or commercial real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move also comes as some lawmakers are advocating less spending. Already, 40 senators are pushing to allow the Treasury's $700 billion bailout fund to expire and direct any remaining funds to pay down the nation's ballooning debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rep. Scott Garrett (R., N.J.) said while he hadn't seen exact details of the plan, he questioned whether the government should be aiming more money at the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't know that we can continue this pattern of having the federal government being the lender of last resort," he said. "Most people are calling on the government to lay out an exit strategy. This just gets us further into the quagmire."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More broadly, the move is an attempt to bolster the role of government in encouraging homeownership, especially among low-income Americans. Considered well-meaning by many, the principle has been blamed by others for fueling the housing boom that led to last year's financial meltdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some state HFAs guarantee loans while others originate mortgages. The agencies also develop affordable multifamily housing or provide financing to developers of such housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To qualify for an HFA loan, borrowers must have certain income levels -- generally a percentage of a state's median income -- good credit scores and verifiable income. The criteria differ by state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agencies typically fund about 100,000 mortgages a year. In 2007, state HFAs issued $17 billion in bonds that funded 126,611 mortgages and some agencies were on track to exceed that level in 2008 before credit markets froze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In total, HFAs have funded mortgages for about 2.6 million families, according to the National Council of State Housing Agencies. That's about 4.6% of the 56 million first-lien mortgages outstanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agencies aren't in trouble because of subprime lending or bad loans. Rather, they have found it increasingly hard to find investors willing to buy the mix of tax-exempt and taxable bonds that HFAs sell to fund mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates have surged on municipal bonds, making it harder for the agencies to offer their less-expensive mortgage rates to borrowers. As a result, most HFA lending has come to a halt. California and Texas have suspended their lending activities altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ken Giebel, marketing director for California's state housing finance agency, CalHFA, said federal support is critical if agencies like his are to continue funding low-rate mortgages. "Our basic mission is to give moderate- to low-income people low interest rates, but that can't happen," when borrowing costs are so high, Mr. Giebel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help these agencies continue lending, the administration will commit to purchasing up to $35 billion of new long-term bonds and shorter-term securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury will try to jump-start new mortgage originations by purchasing up to $20 billion of new, fixed-rate bonds issued by housing agencies. Under the program being discussed, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> would purchase the bonds and securitize them, then sell them to the Treasury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effort is expected to help lower borrowing costs since the government would buy the bonds at interest rates more favorable than housing finance agencies can get in the private market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second effort will set aside $15 billion to target an inexpensive type of financing used by many housing agencies to lower borrowing costs. Variable-rate demand obligations, or VRDOs, are a type of debt used to fund long-term bonds and typically carry interest rates several percentage points lower than regular housing bonds. Housing agencies sell them to investors who resell them daily, weekly or monthly at low short-term rates. About 38 HFAs have $30 billion in such debt outstanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The likely buyers have vanished, however, in part because many of the intermediaries that used to resell the bonds have been downgraded by credit-ratings firms and so investors are unwilling to do business with them. When an investor that's bought VRDOs thinks they can't be resold, it can demand that agencies pay off the debt under accelerated schedules and at high interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To ease the strain, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> will temporarily act as a buyer of last resort for this debt. The administration hopes this will encourage debt holders to hold onto the debt, forestalling the need to pay it back quickly.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty and Dawn Wotapka  </div><div>1003 words</div><div>28 September 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the U.S. housing market shows tentative signs of healing, some of the nation's biggest home builders are starting to acquire land again in preparation for better times. But one builder is hobbled going into this land grab: <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's sixth-largest home builder in terms of the number of sales completed last year, Hovnanian is still trying to recover from its post-boom malaise. Late last week, the company suffered another blow with the death of its founder and chairman, Kevork Hovnanian, 86 years old. His son, Ara, 52, remains chief executive, a post he has held since 1997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman declined to comment on when a new chairman will be named or how the death might affect the family's controlling stake in the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hovnanian took on more debt and made more acquisitions near the top of the housing bubble than most big rivals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the Red Bank, N.J., company is struggling to return to profitability in time to pay down debt and take advantage of potential bargains as banks unload foreclosed land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The company is caught in a tough spot," said David Goldberg, an analyst at <span class="companylink">UBS Investment Bank</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked to comment on the company's financial strains, a Hovnanian spokesman said that "we have been in business for 50 years and successfully navigated through numerous housing cycles."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early last week, Hovnanian sought to ease its debt burden by offering to repurchase as much as $759 million of debt that was due to be repaid over the next eight years. To finance the purchases, the company is likely to issue new bonds maturing in eight to 10 years, said Vincent Foley, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would leave the company's debt at high levels but allow it to delay repayments of the bulk of its debt that otherwise would have occurred in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debt restructuring "buys them a lot more time and some flexibility," said Ivy Zelman, chief executive of Zelman &amp;Associates, a research firm. But Hovnanian still "won't have nearly as much dry powder to put to work" on land purchases compared to most of its big rivals, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of July 31, the end of its fiscal third quarter, Hovnanian's net debt stood at 109% of total capital, far above the average of 26% for the 12 big home builders tracked by Zelman &amp;Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other builders are boasting of their ability to seize on land bargains. <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. said it spent $77 million to buy lots in Florida, Texas, California and elsewhere in its fiscal third quarter ended Aug. 31, up from $58 million in the prior three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar also invested $140 million for a 15% stake in a California-based land-development company, the purchase of several communities previously owned by that company, and the settlement and release of any claims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the spending, Lennar's net debt stands at about 36% of capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hovnanian spent $37 million on land in its latest quarter and has insisted it will be able to purchase more land as opportunities arise, partly by teaming up with financial partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of its past purchases were ill-timed. Hovnanian made six acquisitions of smaller builders between November 2003 and April 2006. Four were in Florida, now widely considered to be the nation's weakest housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, in August 2005 Hovnanian bought <span class="companylink">First Home Builders of Florida</span>, which operated in the Cape Coral-Fort Myers area of southwestern Florida, on undisclosed terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, Hovnanian said population growth and a healthy job market "make Florida an attractive market for the foreseeable future."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within a few months, home sales in Florida began to stall. Since peaking in mid-2006, prices in the Cape Coral-Fort Myers area have plunged 50%, according to First American CoreLogic. In 2007, Hovnanian announced a write-off of $107.7 million of assets related to the Fort Myers operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another investment, Hovnanian began construction in 2007 on its biggest tower, a 48-story condominium project called 77 Hudson in Jersey City, N.J., near Manhattan. A sharp drop in Wall Street employment has made it harder to find buyers for the tower's 420 units, according to real-estate agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's the right building at the wrong time," said David Bartz, an agent who does business in Jersey City, where many condo buildings sprouted during the boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hovnanian was founded in 1959 by the elder Mr. Hovnanian and three brothers, ethnic Armenians who immigrated to the U.S. from Iraq.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company initially focused on New Jersey and later branched out to neighboring states and Florida. For a time, it built mainly low-cost, cookie-cutter developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hovnanian now builds homes in 18 states, up from seven in the late 1990s. While some builders focus on either the high or low end of the market, Hovnanian tries to be a jack of all trades, with houses at most price points. It also builds communities for older people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has reported losses of more than $2.3 billion over the past three years. Daniel Oppenheim, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>, projects a further loss of $305 million for the year ending Oct 31, 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hovnanian has responded to the red ink by slashing its work force to 1,891 in July from 6,870 three years earlier. Hovnanian's stock-market value has plunged to about $314 million from a peak of about $4.8 billion in July 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite its troubles, <span class="companylink">UBS</span>'s Mr. Goldberg cautions investors against writing off Hovnanian. "It's not clear how this is going to play out," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sara Murray </div><div>548 words</div><div>26 September 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer sentiment and new-home sales showed signs of improvement Friday, while sales of durable goods fell, signaling the U.S. economy's recovery won't be a smooth ride.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Optimism among U.S. consumers reached its highest level in September since January 2008, and new-home sales posted their fifth-straight month of improvements. But manufacturers' orders for durable goods -- big-ticket items designed to last three years or more -- tumbled 2.4% to a seasonally adjusted $164.44 billion in August, on a plunge in aircraft orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Together, "it's indicative of a patchy, slow recovery," said Joshua Shapiro, MFR Inc.'s chief economist. "In that type of environment, you're going to get some things that disappoint; you're going to get some things that are all right."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department's durable-goods report was a surprising blow to the manufacturing sector. In July, durable orders rose 4.8%, and data released earlier this month showed the industry was growing. Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, a key gauge of business spending, declined 0.4%, after falling 1.3% in July. The small drop added to concerns about the underlying health of the U.S. economy, particularly as government stimulus programs -- including the "cash for clunkers" program and housing-market support -- wind down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, the manufacturing sector has largely posted improvements lately, and most analysts say the durable-goods numbers should look better in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index rose to 73.5 this month, up from 65.7 in August. Consumers' views of the current and future state of the economy improved. Even though consumers expect things to get better, a variety of headwinds, such as stagnant wages and the high unemployment rate, still plague them. That's likely to contribute to the slow rebound in consumer spending, which makes up about 70% of the country's gross domestic product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales rose 0.7% in August, from the previous month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 429,000, the Commerce Department said Friday. The supply of unsold homes eased, too, falling to 7.3 months in August from 7.6 months in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices remained low as a result of excess inventories and a plethora of foreclosed homes. The median price for new homes was $195,200 in August, down 11.7% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the increase in new-home sales and evidence that inventories of both new and existing homes are falling, analysts expressed some concern that housing numbers weren't stronger last month. On Thursday, a report showed that existing-home sales dropped 2.7% in August after four months of improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"On the whole, this was a somewhat disappointing report, and when combined with the poor existing-home sales report yesterday, suggests that the recent positive momentum in the U.S. housing market may be slowing," <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span>' Millan L.B. Mulraine wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall trend, though, shows the sector has come up from the bottom and is stabilizing, aided by reduced prices, a government tax credit and lower levels of construction.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp;Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Crawford was married to Mary Crawford when they moved into the house at 1626 W. Boston Blvd. in Detroit in 1924. Mr. Crawford continued to live in the home with his second wife, Minnetta Crawford, after his first wife's death. A Saturday front-page article on the history of the house incorrectly stated that John and Minnetta Crawford were already married at the time he took possession of the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ September 29, 2009)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(See related letter: "Letters to the Editor: One Home Personifies Detroit's History" -- WSJ Oct. 2, 2009)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DETROIT -- On a grassy lot on a quiet block on a graceful boulevard stands the answer to a perplexing question: Why does the typical house in Detroit sell for $7,100?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brick-and-stucco home at 1626 W. Boston Blvd. has watched almost a century of Detroit's ups and downs, through industrial brilliance and racial discord, economic decline and financial collapse. Its owners have played a part in it all. There was the engineer whose innovation elevated auto makers into kings; the teacher who watched fellow whites flee to the suburbs; the black plumber who broke the color barrier; the cop driven out by crime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last individual owner was a subprime borrower, who lost the house when investors foreclosed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A city that began a slow slide 60 years ago has now entered a free fall, pushed by the twin crises of housing and cars. Detroit's population peaked at 1.85 million in the 1950 census. It is now less than half that. In July, unemployment hit 28.9%, almost triple the national average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the median selling price for a home stood at a paltry $7,100 as of July, according to First American CoreLogic Inc., a real-estate research firm -- down from $73,000 three years earlier. A typical house in Cleveland sells for $65,000. One in St. Louis goes for $120,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, battered and forlorn today, both Detroit and 1626 W. Boston Blvd. were solid and optimistic 90 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Truman Newberry:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laying a Foundation</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in the 20th century, Detroit was the place to make money, and to Truman H. Newberry, the ground beneath the city's Boston-Edison neighborhood was the way to make it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Newberry, the son of a congressman, was a founding investor in Packard Motor Car Co., a maker of luxury autos. A portly man with a pince-nez and bushy moustache, he also dabbled in politics: In the 1918 race for the U.S. Senate, he defeated Henry Ford, the founder of <span class="companylink">Ford Motor Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A campaign-spending scandal quickly brought Mr. Newberry's political career to a halt. But Detroit was growing rapidly -- leaping from the country's 13th most populous city to its fourth in the first two decades of the 1900s -- and Mr. Newberry and his brother owned land in an up-and-coming area called Boston-Edison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They subdivided it into roomy parcels to accommodate Detroit's newly prosperous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clarence Avery:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial Innovator</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1917, the Newberry brothers sold a lot on West Boston Boulevard to Clarence and Lura Avery. The covenants required the Averys to spend at least $5,000 on construction of the new house, which had to sit 50 feet from the front lot line and be built of brick, stone or stucco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Avery, born in 1882, taught shop to Henry Ford's son, Edsel. "You have an engineering mind," Edsel told Mr. Avery, according to the latter's grandson, Avery Greene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon, through his friendship with Edsel, Mr. Avery landed a job at Ford. He started on a three-month internship at 25 cents an hour. At the time, Mr. Ford was pushing his men to speed production of the Model Ts, each of which then took 12 1/2 man-hours to build. Today, historians credit Mr. Avery, more than anyone else, for turning Mr. Ford's wishes into a breakthrough that would change the nature of American industry: the moving assembly line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Avery wandered Ford's Highland Park plant, stop-watch in hand, learning how the cars were built. He studied meat-packing plants, where hog carcasses were disassembled on a conveyor. His team tested its theories by dragging a car chassis across the factory floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moving assembly line -- on which workers repeated specific tasks as the vehicles passed by -- cut assembly time for a Model T by almost 80%, to 2.7 man-hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Ford and Detroit prospered, so did the Averys. Their move from a small house near the Ford plant to their freshly constructed home on West Boston Boulevard was a steep climb up the social ladder. Henry Ford's own starter mansion stood close by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Avery home had four bedrooms and a third-floor suite for the German maid. There was a butler's pantry off of the kitchen and a fireplace in the living room. Mrs. Avery set trellises against the front of the house and hung frilled curtains in the upstairs windows. Shortly after moving in, she gave birth to Anabel in a bedroom facing the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I loved that house," says Anabel Avery Baxley, now 91 and living in Alabama. "I don't think I ever felt quite the same about a house as I did about that house."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Autos made a number of Detroiters very rich and they yearned for more exclusive housing. The Averys, too, built a grander home on a wooded lot in ritzy Palmer Woods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Crawford:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pushed Out</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1924, they rented out, and later sold, 1626 W. Boston Blvd. to Edsel Ford's personal assistant, John Crawford, and his wife, Minnetta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edsel headed a design team trying to add style to Ford functionality. As part of that, "I had to figure out how or if the car could be built," Mr. Crawford was quoted as saying in a 1974 Special-Interest Auto magazine article. "Could we form a sheet of steel to the desired shape? Was the chrome trim practical?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ford was a Machiavellian workplace, where members of one faction drilled peepholes to spy on their bureaucratic opponents, according to a book about the era by Thomas E. Bonsall. In this environment, Mr. Crawford -- who retained the heavy brogue of his native Scotland -- also served as Edsel's protector, according to the reminiscences of Bob Gregorie, a Ford designer at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the early 1940s as Edsel Ford was dying of cancer, his enemies ousted Mr. Crawford. Mr. Crawford moved to Massachusetts and put 1626 W. Boston Blvd. on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By then, the street had slipped a notch in desirability. Detroit's well-to-do moved to more grandiose housing in Grosse Pointe and other suburbs, their commutes made possible by the very automobiles that had made them rich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marie Ryan:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From White to Black</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That allowed people of more modest means, such as Marie E. Ryan, a single schoolteacher, to aspire to West Boston Boulevard. She was born in 1894 in Ypsilanti, Mich., a town of 7,000, where in 1900 the average farmer owned 48 sheep and 108 acres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ryan's father was a conductor on the Michigan Central Railroad, her mother an immigrant from France. Graduating high school in 1911, she was named "school prophetess" -- a position she fulfilled by writing a whimsical essay predicting her classmates' futures. One boy would build a "wireless telegraph station" on the North Pole, she said; another would woo his love from a "flying machine." The Rust sisters would end up lion tamers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miss Ryan herself went on to attend Michigan State Normal College, then spent 35 years teaching music in the Detroit public schools. She was 48 when she bought 1626 W. Boston Blvd. in 1942, taking out a $5,000, 20-year mortgage at a fixed 4.5% interest rate. Her monthly principal-and-interest payments came to $31.65.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she moved in, the neighborhood was still fashionable for whites. That changed during the 23 years she owned the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1910, blacks accounted for just 1.2% of the total population of 465,766. By 1960, the percentage had grown to 29% of 1.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition for jobs and homes became acute. The tensions accelerated the use of real-estate covenants to prevent blacks, Jews and other minorities from moving in. Between 1940 and 1947, every new Detroit subdivision barred black residents, says Thomas Sugrue, a University of Pennsylvania historian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some deeds in the Boston-Edison neighborhood had such restrictions, but not 1626 W. Boston. Early in the century, few owners in white neighborhoods would have sold to a black family in any case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the 1950s, however, the white exodus to the suburbs was in full swing, and the neighborhood became a prestigious address for black doctors and lawyers seeking the large houses, leafy streets and social status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1965, Miss Ryan, 71 and still single, sold 1626 W. Boston Blvd. to its first black owners, Herman and Ida Adams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adams Family:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blue-Collar Elite</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. and Mrs. Adams, buying the house was a social high-jump. Mr. Adams had moved north from Georgia just before World War II. He joined the Army as a cook, but ended up fighting at the Battle of the Bulge in 1944 and earning a Bronze Star, according to his son, Bob Adams. After the war, Mr. Adams landed a job stamping out engine parts for Chrysler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the side, Mr. Adams and his two brothers-in-law ran a plumbing business. One was American Indian and light-skinned enough to pass for European white. So he wore a suit and pretended to be the boss to win white customers, while the darker men, posing as his employees, did the plumbing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They couldn't believe that people went for it, but they did," recalls Bob Adams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Adams was a prize-winning typist and graduate of all-black Lewis Business College. She owned beauty shops and worked as a state unemployment-claims examiner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family had been living in a Polish, working-class neighborhood. Bob Adams recalls his mother getting a phone call in the 1950s from a real-estate agent who, apparently thinking the Adamses were white, urged them to sell by warning that blacks were moving into the neighborhood. "They're coming," the agent told Mrs. Adams, according to Bob Adams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The old neighborhood did shift from Polish to black. But, in any case, Mrs. Adams wanted to move up to Boston-Edison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My mother wanted to move over there because she desired to have a bigger house -- plain and simple," says the couple's daughter, Veronica Adams, now 49. Mr. and Mrs. Adams borrowed $14,500 to pay for the home on West Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Veronica loved peering out of her second-floor bedroom window at the leaves of the American elm in the front yard. When Dutch elm disease swept down Boston Boulevard, the city nailed a notice to the tree, marking it for removal. Veronica used her father's claw hammer to pull the sign down -- several times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They can take any other tree in the neighborhood, but they're not taking my tree," she recalls thinking. Eventually, the city did cut down the tree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ava Tinsley, a black neighbor, played jacks on the Adams' front porch as a girl. She remembers scraping her hand when the jacks snagged the rough edges of the red-brown tiles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Veronica and Bob recall the black doctors on the block, including one who owned a motor home, a stretch limo, a Corvette and two Lincolns. Veronica recalls complaints about how the doctors' families snubbed the auto workers' families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Adams died of lung cancer in 1966, leaving Mr. Adams to raise the children alone just as manufacturing in Detroit began its long slide. City factories shed about 130,000 jobs between the mid-1950s and the late 1960s, according to Prof. Sugrue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic unease contributed to a volatile atmosphere in 1967. On a hot night in July, police raided a "blind pig," an unlicensed saloon in a black neighborhood, and arrested 85 people. The incident escalated into five days of rioting that left 43 dead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across from the Adams house, young Michelle May, an African-American, peeked through closed curtains at the looters running in the street. "If there were any more white or Jewish people, they got out of here after that," says Ms. May, 46, who still lives there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Adams, the riots presented a chance to leap the color barrier at the auto plant where he worked. During the violence, white workers stayed away from the factory. When a couple of sinks broke, there was no union pipe-fitter to do the repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you give me the wrenches, I'll fix it," Herman Adams told the plant superintendent, according to Bob Adams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later, the boss made sure Mr. Adams made it onto the union apprenticeship program -- a career path largely closed to blacks at the time. In 1979, Mr. Adams retired from Chrysler a master pipe-fitter, one of the blue-collar aristocracy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Detroit and the auto industry were declining in tandem. In 1980, Chrysler skated past bankruptcy only through the intercession of the Carter administration. Struggling to adjust to consumers' desire for reliable, fuel-efficient cars, car makers shuttered Detroit factories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After her father died in 1989, Veronica Adams, then a security officer with the city water department, lived in the house. She tired of poor services, high taxes and rising crime. The family fell behind on property taxes, both Adams children say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1999, an appraiser valued the home at $104,000 and said it needed $12,000 in repairs to patch the plaster and fix plumbing in three of the four bathrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Andrews:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Such a Steal'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea of being urban pioneers appealed to David Andrews, a young, black Detroit police officer, and his wife, Ruth. Scouting Boston-Edison for a house in 1999, they spotted Veronica Adams pounding a for-sale sign into the yard at 1626 W. Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They closed the deal for $79,900. "It was in some disrepair," Mr. Andrews recalls. "But we thought, given the values in the neighborhood, it was such a steal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Andrews turned a blind eye to the vacant house across the street. They borrowed tens of thousands of dollars for improvements and to buy a car. They refinished the oak floors. They replaced the furnace and pipes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Andrews, now 42, used the third-floor maid's quarters as his hideaway. Soon after they moved in, Ms. Andrews, now 40, became pregnant with their first child.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting in the 1990s, American car companies enjoyed a brief interlude of optimism brought on by low gasoline prices and a boom in sports-utility vehicles. Detroit, like the nation as a whole, got caught up in the housing bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Andrews watched happily as their own house's value rose. But crime drained their enthusiasm. Three times, thieves broke into their cars. "When they come into my house, I'm out of here," Mr. Andrews told a neighbor at the time, they both recall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not long afterwards, Mr. Andrews found his house pillaged. The antique chairs were gone. A trail of his CDs crossed the front lawn. The couple found a house they wanted on a golf course. But it took them a year to sell 1626 W. Boston Blvd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kimberly Carpenter:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big, Risky Debt Pile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, they found a buyer, Kimberly Carpenter, willing to pay their $189,000 asking price. They were too relieved to question why Ms. Carpenter's closing documents recorded the sales price as $250,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were just praying and praying we could sell it so we could move to the golf course," says Ms. Andrews.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">County records show Ms. Carpenter took out simultaneous loans of $200,000 and $50,000 from First NLC Financial Services, a unit of Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group, an Arlington, Va., investment bank. First NLC specialized in subprime mortgages -- loans for borrowers with damaged credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, Detroit was swept up in the subprime-lending frenzy that hit much of the country and eventually sparked the financial crisis and deep recession. Lenders became quick to loan to high-risk borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Carpenter, 37, says she was buying the house on behalf of her father, Lewis Maxwell, whose own credit record was too blemished. "My father handled all of that," she says of the financial details. Her father, who worked on the Chrysler assembly line, died of cancer in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David and Ruth Andrews say Ms. Carpenter paid them $189,000. They say they don't know what happened to the other $61,000 entered into sales records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have no idea about any of that," says Ms. Carpenter. "It's over. It's out of my head."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neighbors say nobody maintained or lived in 1626 W. Boston Blvd. A lawyer for the neighborhood association wrote a letter to Ms. Carpenter urging her to clean the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Houses that are vacant and/or in obvious disrepair invite vandalism, theft and stripping, which not only destroys your property value, but impacts adversely on the neighborhood as a whole," the letter stated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American Residential Equities: Foreclosed</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Carpenter quickly fell behind on her payments. In August, 2006, First NLC Financial bundled Ms. Carpenter's first loan with a pool of other troubled mortgages and sold them to American Residential Equities, or ARE, a Miami company that specialized in buying bad loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First NLC Financial went into liquidation last January, dragged down by mortgage losses. Its parent company, FBR Group, became <span class="companylink">Arlington Asset Investment Corp</span>. A spokesman for Arlington said the company can't locate the original files on the Carpenter loans or comment on the lending decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By November 2006, ARE's collection agents were after Ms. Carpenter for $218,348.53 on the $200,000 mortgage, according to county documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few months later, ARE foreclosed, and in February 2007 a deputy sheriff auctioned the property at city hall. No outside bidder was willing to pay the $170,000 minimum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early 2008, Ms. Carpenter filed for bankruptcy protection, according to court records. ARE, meanwhile, sold the house to Petra Finance LLC, a private, Miami-based investment firm. In May 2008, Petra Finance put the house on the market for $75,000. Unable to find a buyer for almost a year, the company ratcheted down the asking price to $14,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lisa Johanon:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A New Beginning</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This past April, the Central Detroit Christian Community Development Corp., a nonprofit, bought Clarence Avery's house for $10,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One day this summer, Lisa Johanon, the group's executive director, undid the padlock on John Crawford's boarded-up front door. Sheets of peeling paint hung from Marie Ryan's kitchen ceiling. Advertising fliers littered the porch where Veronica Adams's neighbors played jacks. The glass was missing from the window on the staircase to David Andrews's third-floor sanctuary. Kimberly Carpenter's radiators had been stolen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Usually, Ms. Johanon's charity provides subsidized housing in the poorest neighborhoods -- where ice-cream cones are sold from behind bullet-proof glass -- not high-end areas such as Boston-Edison. But now some 100 out of the 900-odd houses in Boston-Edison are vacant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you can't save 1626 W. Boston Blvd., Ms. Johanon wondered aloud, what hope is there for the rest of Detroit? Walking through, she noted the heavily stained carpet and the rickety back steps, but also the rich woodwork and the clawfoot tub.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She hopes her group can revive the house and find a new family willing to bet on Detroit. "A minimal spec, I'd say, would be $30,000 to $35,000, and it would be in pretty good shape," she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks fell, led by the materials and financial sectors, after a weak reading of home sales deepened investors' worries about the broader U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Alcoa</span> led the decline among stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, sinking 4.5% as metals prices fell. <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> , <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> and <span class="companylink">General Electric</span> each declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market had received an early boost from better-than-expected data on first-time unemployment claims, but the gains evaporated after the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said sales of existing homes fell last month, snapping a four-month streak of rising sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 41.11 points, or 0.4%, to close at 9707.44, after posting a gain of nearly 60 points at its morning high. The technology-focused <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> Composite Index was off 1.1%, at 2107.61.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mala Sander listed a 2,800-square-foot beachfront home overlooking Sag Harbor on Aug. 6, she hoped for a few nibbles that might lead to an offer near her asking price of $4.35 million. Then 30 brokers showed up at the first open house, resulting in an offer, at full asking price, in four days. Amazed, the owners rejected the offer and raised the price tag to $4.5 million. Another buyer matched the new price two days later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm completely booked every weekend," says Ms. Sander, of <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the luxury real-estate market remains moribund in most parts of the country, there are a few signs of a nascent turnaround in the Hamptons, a string of beach communities housing some of New York's wealthiest. The number of new deals put into contract jumped to 156 in August from 62 in July, says Corcoran's Rick Hoffman, who tracks a listing system shared with other companies in eastern Long Island. Home sales also rose 34% to 344 units in the second quarter from the prior quarter, according to Suffolk Research Service Inc., a local real estate data firm. While up, that's far less than the 576 units sold in the second quarter of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hamptons developer Joe Farrell, who built his last spec home for more than $7 million two years ago, is ramping up again. Earlier in the spring, he says it was no problem getting 10% to 15% discounts on "blue-chip" lots south of Montauk Highway and within walking distance to the beach. Now, "some stuff is going into bidding wars," says Mr. Farrell, who recently lost out on a one-acre lot on Bridgehampton's Sand Piper Drive near the beach for $3.15 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers remain circumspect about whether the surge heralds a real recovery. From May 1 to Aug. 31, pre-foreclosure filings in the Hamptons jumped 31% to 294 from year-earlier levels, according to Long Island Profiles, a publisher of real-estate and foreclosure data. Summer sales were "mediocre at best," says Peter Turino of Brown Harris Stevens. "This is probably a temporary improvement. I think we'll have a very slow winter."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales jump partially reflects lower prices, but brokers say the increased activity also reflects changes on Wall Street, whose workers represent the largest proportion of Hamptons buyers. "I think word is that bonuses are going to be good," says Ms. Sander, who notes the buyers of her Sag Harbor home work in finance. "I think it gives them confidence to buy." The return of rank-and-file Wall Streeters helped activity increase most for homes under $6 million, considered here the middle-luxury tier of the market. Brokers say employees from <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, which recently reported net income of $3.44 billion for the quarter ended June 26, are particularly well-represented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone agrees that the Hamptons are a long way from total recovery. The median sale price of a home on Long Island's East End was $560,000 in the spring of this year, down 32% from the peak price of $825,000 in the first half of 2007, according to Suffolk Research. Inventory remains high: In August there were 4,900 homes for sale in the Hamptons, or roughly the equivalent of about three years of inventory, according to StreetEasy, a New York-based online listing service. Some seasoned brokers say pent-up demand and a delayed spring selling season are responsible for the summer surge in activity. The market is "going sideways," says Dottie Herman, president and CEO of Prudential Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the ultra-high end, sales remain rare. Former advertising executive-turned-car dealership mogul Carl Spielvogel and his wife, Barbaralee, are still trying to sell their 25-acre Southampton estate for $28 million. A five-acre estate on Southampton's Meadow Lane with a pool and tennis court is listed for $25.9 million; a similar property sold for $30.5 million two years ago. Some of the biggest sales were staged by government regulators, who successfully auctioned off the Southampton house of indicted former hedge-fund manager James Nicholson for $25.9 million. The Montauk home of Bernard Madoff garnered four bids and went into contract for more than its $8.75 million asking price after just two weeks on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, everyone is looking for the good deal. In Montauk, a 0.36-acre property went into contract three weeks ago for close to $1 million, about 44% off its original December 2008 asking price of $1.8 million. The buyer never set foot inside the 500-square-foot house, says listing agent Peter Moore of Corcoran, because he plans to tear it down. Nearby in Montauk, Charles Entenmann, whose family created the baked-goods empire, sold his home at 93 Prospect Hill Lane, for $2.2 million in July after originally asking $4.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while Wall Streeters still predominate, brokers say the new pricing also is enticing buyers from other fields. JoLee Sanchez, a 38-year-old homemaker whose husband is about to sell his general-contracting business, says she has seen 100 houses since she started shopping for an investment property "in the high 900s," in April. Southampton Village "would've been a little out of reach for us a couple of years ago," Ms. Sanchez says. Now, "with our circumstances the way they are, it's going to happen."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak housing data squelched an early U.S. stock rally, and the market ended the day with a second straight decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up nearly 60 points in the first half-hour of trading, after weekly jobless claims came in better than expected. It ended with a 41.11-point decline at 9707.44.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500-stock index was off 1%, led by a 2% decline in its basic-materials sector. All its other categories posted losses as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil futures fell 4.5% to $65.89 a barrel, the biggest decline and the lowest settlement price since July 29. Treasury prices rose after a strong auction of seven-year notes. The dollar also gained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks lost ground after the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes fell 2.7% last month, snapping four months of rising sales that analysts had expected to continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financials were also hard hit, with the S&amp;P's financial category off 1.8%. Among the sector's big decliners was <span class="companylink">Moody's</span>, which fell 4.4% after the House oversight panel postponed a hearing on credit-ratings agencies after the committee's chairman said he wanted <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> to respond to allegations by a former employee that it continues to inflate its ratings of complex products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">McGraw-Hill</span>, which owns <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> rival <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>, tumbled 6.5%. Both stocks have fallen nearly 30% this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the Dow's financial components, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> fell 3% and <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> was down 1.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some market participants remain upbeat that it can resume the trend higher that had pushed the Dow and S&amp;P to highs for the year on Tuesday. The Dow remains up 11% this year, and the S&amp;P is up 16%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For any money manager who's benchmarking to an index, it's very difficult to try to time a market correction by moving into cash," said strategist Carmine Grigoli of Mizuho Securities USA. "The bigger risk, in many cases, is that you don't want to get left behind in a rally and try to make up performance, which is very difficult to do."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAPLES, Fla. -- It isn't easy living on a golf course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bonita Bay Group, once a premier developer of upper-crust golf communities in this upper-crust town, is on the verge of collapse. The company says it will be forced to file for bankruptcy if it must refund $245 million in golf-club membership fees some homeowners are demanding, in a battle that is pitting residents against each other and against the company that sold them lavish dream homes during the height of the boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the 1990s and the earlier part of this decade, Bonita Bay was regarded as one of the leading developers in the Naples area, which has the highest per capita income of any locale in the country except Stamford-Greenwich, Conn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bonita Bay launched seven Naples-area communities where houses sold for as much as $12 million and came with access to exclusive golf clubs with restaurants, tennis courts and pools. Its homeowners have included Richard Schulze, the billionaire chairman of <span class="companylink">Best Buy Corp</span>., opera diva Kiri Te Kanawa and New Jersey Nets President Rod Thorn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, like many other Sunbelt developers, Bonita Bay is being squeezed by debt and plunging sales. But its biggest problem is a dispute over the deposits homeowners plunked down for memberships in the golf clubs, a marina and other clubs. Many members want to quit the clubs and get their money back for reasons ranging from cheaper golf elsewhere to the desire for ready cash. Their membership agreements say the deposits -- as much as $185,000 per member -- are refundable on demand, a relatively unusual stipulation homeowners say was a big part of the appeal of joining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Bonita Bay says the agreements also state the rules "may be amended from time to time," thus allowing it to cancel the refund policy at its discretion -- and that, at any rate, it can't pay the money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angry residents have filed at least 15 lawsuits against Bonita Bay seeking the return of their deposits and accusing the company of civil fraud. They say the right to amend the rules doesn't apply to the refund policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Florida attorney general, responding to a citizen complaint, is investigating Bonita Bay to see whether the way it sold and refunded membership deposits was a Ponzi scheme. One Bonita Bay resident and former Wall Street executive, Michael Lissack, has filed a complaint against the company with the Internal Revenue Service, saying it owes back taxes on profits it made by holding the deposits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bonita Bay's bind is one of the strongest signs yet that putting up houses around fairways -- a hallmark of the real-estate boom -- has lost its cachet. Several other developers of golf communities have already entered bankruptcy proceedings, including the Winchester Country Club in Auburn, Calif., and Promontory in Park City, Utah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Bonita Bay Chairman David Lucas scoffs at the idea that the company is running a Ponzi scheme -- in which investors are paid returns from money that comes from later investors -- or doing anything else that is wrong. Mr. Lucas says the deposits were used to meet operating costs, and aren't taxable. He says the developer is simply in a financial bind as a result of bad land purchases combined with the real-estate downturn, and that members of his wife's family, which owns the closely held company, have poured in funds to keep Bonita Bay going. He says losses in the past three years have "completely wiped out" prior profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bonita Bay has already closed the golf club at Twin Eagles, its latest development, where most of the lots are unsold and weeds are sprouting from the bunkers. In addition to threatening bankruptcy if it has to refund deposits at the other clubs, the developer says it might have to shut down the clubs entirely unless residents come up with millions of dollars to buy them, a prospect that has homeowners doubly steamed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Golf-community developers typically sell golf clubs to members once the developments are completed, and convert membership deposits into equity stakes. But Bonita Bay is trying to do so at a time when many members want out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Living amid the swaying palms, many well-heeled residents of Bonita Bay's developments say they feel burned and trapped. Few are eager to pour fresh money into the golf clubs, but many believe that allowing them to close would take away the central attraction of the communities and further erode house values on the Bonita Bay sites. Local real-estate agents say prices are off by more than the 36% average decline that Naples-area housing has suffered since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morris Shepard, a former Northeastern University professor who sold an Internet company he started in the 1990s and moved to a Bonita Bay community, says he stopped paying dues to his fitness and beach clubs this year "because I don't deal with crooks," referring to the fact that company has refused to give people their money back. Mr. Shepard says he is opposed to giving any more money to Bonita Bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There have been severe cutbacks in services and in the condition of the facilities," says Mr. Schulze, the <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span> chairman, who says he hasn't asked for his deposit back but also doesn't want to pony up more money to buy the club at Bonita Bay. "Mold is growing in the bag rooms" where players store golf clubs, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bonita Bay acknowledges it has cut maintenance to hold down costs but it says the clubs "will be in excellent shape for the [winter] season," when most members hit the links.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some residents say the issue of buying the clubs has created bitterness between the wealthiest homeowners, who often have golf memberships, and less wealthy residents who enjoy the landscaping but resent pressure to contribute to the purchase of the clubs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Bonita Bay's Mediterra community, a committee of golf-club members initially proposed pushing nonmembers to join the club on a social basis and pay $2,500 or more to help fund the purchase. They were told if they didn't join, no future buyers of their homes would be allowed to become golf members. A number of residents called the plan extortion, and the committee eventually dropped its demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Schmidt, who lives in Mediterra, where many homes have colonnaded porticos, four-car garages and wine cellars, is part of a group of residents trying to buy the golf club.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bonita Bay, he says, was once "the platinum standard" among developers, and he would like to preserve the community he lives in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The former chief of water utility <span class="companylink">Aquarion Co</span>. says not buying the club opens it to the uncertainty of bankruptcy and a sale to others or opening it to the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family-owned company was started by David Shakarian, who founded vitamin retailer <span class="companylink">GNC Corp</span>. In 1985, it broke ground on the first of its developments, the Bonita Bay Club, which sported a marina on the Gulf of Mexico, three golf courses, homes that went for $3 million and condominium towers. Over the years, the company added six more developments. Its communities now cover 16 square miles of southwest Florida with 12,096 dwellings. Mr. Shakarian died in 1984, just before the first development went up, and the company has been run ever since by his son-in-law, Mr. Lucas, now 62.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lucas says the first sign of trouble for Bonita Bay started with Hurricane Wilma, which hit Naples hard in 2005 and scared away potential land buyers -- many of them contractors who build homes for buyers. Then Florida real estate began to crater, and the mortgage crisis hit. Bonita Bay's land sales are expected to fall to $1.9 million this year from $343 million in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company appeared to be getting by with revenue from the clubs and property management and maintenance fees, until a surge of requests for membership refunds began last autumn. "It was like a run on the bank," Mr. Lucas says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November 2008, the company told homeowners who had paid $245 million in club deposits that it would no longer redeem the fees on demand. The company says it had returned $77 million in such fees over the prior three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first resident suit against Bonita was filed in December. Mr. Lucas acknowledges that Bonita Bay had promised refunds on demand in its membership agreements, but says members also signed documents that disclosed the terms could be changed at any time. Plaintiffs in the lawsuit say the terms that could be changed were limited and didn't cover refunds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bonita Bay now says that in the future it will refund a deposit to one member for every three new members who join.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the membership furor was unfolding, Bonita Bay was being forced to renegotiate its loans from Cleveland-based KeyCorp bank. With new lending from the Shakarian family, it cut KeyCorp debt to $74 million from $105 million, but the bank is tightly limiting further loans. Mr. Lucas says Bonita Bay also has $41 million in liabilities in community-development bonds. KeyCorp declined to comment, except to say it hasn't tried to seize Bonita Bay.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sara Murray </div><div>438 words</div><div>25 September 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>9</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. existing-home sales slipped in August, as the housing market stumbled on its path to recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the labor market showed progress as initial claims for jobless benefits fell again last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes declined 2.7% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.10 million units, after four straight months of increases, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. That represented a swift change from July, when sales rose at the fastest rate in 10 years to a pace of 5.24 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For businesses in the housing industry, Thursday's NAR data illustrate just how choppy the housing market has become. Business has been flat in September at Workman Mortgage Co. in Melbourne, Fla., as fewer applicants have come in. That followed a "great" August and a July that was the worst month in the company's 20-year history, said Ritch Workman, the company's president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts agree that the overall decline seems to be a bump along the way to stabilization. Total housing inventory still fell 10.8% at the end of August, leaving an 8.5-month supply, compared with a 9.3-month supply in July. With unsold inventory now 16.4% lower than a year ago, the market is largely following a positive track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the supply of homes is relatively high. In combination with low prices, that has created a buyer's market that doesn't show signs of changing anytime soon. The median price nationwide for existing homes was $177,700 in August, 12.5% lower than the same month a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before the NAR released its latest results, housing experts worried about the growing number of foreclosed homes in the pipeline -- but not yet on the market. And with distressed properties accounting for 31% of sales in August, home prices are likely to stay low. Unemployment also remains a pressing issue that could keep potential buyers on the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The still-weak labor market logged improvements in the week ended Sept. 19 as first-time claims for jobless benefits fell 21,000 to 530,000, the Labor Department said Thursday in its weekly report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week moving average, which aims to smooth volatility, dropped 11,000 to 553,500. Continuing claims, benefits drawn by workers for more than one week, fell to 6.14 million in the week ended Sept. 12, 123,000 less than the previous week.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Treasury prices rose Thursday, pushing the 10-year yield to its lowest in more than a week, after a weaker-than-expected report on existing-home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Yields tripped lower following the dive in [August] existing-home sales, which came against the grain of recent improvements in the sector," said analysts at Action Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At noon, the 10-year note was up 10/32 point at 102 1/32 to yield 3.3813%, while the 30-year bond was up 14/32 at 105 23/32 to yield 4.1636%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Treasury Department sold a record $29 billion in seven-year notes Thursday at a yield of 3.005%, the last of three big note auctions this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors bid for 2.79 times the amount of debt available, compared to 2.73 times on average at the last three auctions. Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes foreign central banks, purchased 61.7% of the sale. On average, they have bought 63.6% of the last three auctions since June, when a change in the way bids were tallied pushed up indirect bidder statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasurys turned higher after the National Association of Realtors said resales of U.S. homes dropped 2.7% in August, the first decline in five months, while prices fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasurys had been under pressure earlier in the session after the Labor Department said 530,000 more Americans filed first-time claims for unemployment benefits in the latest week, down 21,000 from the previous week.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sara Lin and Christina S.N. Lewis </div><div>951 words</div><div>25 September 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>W10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mala Sander listed a 2,800-square-foot beachfront home overlooking Sag Harbor on Aug. 6, she hoped for a few nibbles that might lead to an offer near her asking price of $4.35 million. Then 30 brokers showed up at the first open house, resulting in an offer, at full asking price, in four days. Amazed, the owners rejected the offer and raised the price tag to $4.5 million. Another buyer matched the new price two days later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm completely booked every weekend," says Ms. Sander, of <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the luxury real-estate market remains moribund in most parts of the country, there are a few signs of a nascent turnaround in the Hamptons, a string of beach communities housing some of New York's wealthiest. The number of new deals put into contract jumped to 156 in August from 62 in July, says Corcoran's Rick Hoffman, who tracks a listing system shared with other companies in eastern Long Island. Home sales also rose 34% to 344 units in the second quarter from the prior quarter, according to Suffolk Research Service Inc., a local real estate data firm. While up, that's far less than the 576 units sold in the second quarter of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hamptons developer Joe Farrell, who built his last spec home for more than $7 million two years ago, is ramping up again. Earlier in the spring, he says it was no problem getting 10% to 15% discounts on "blue-chip" lots south of Montauk Highway and within walking distance to the beach. Now, "some stuff is going into bidding wars," says Mr. Farrell, who recently lost out on a one-acre lot on Bridgehampton's Sand Piper Drive near the beach for $3.15 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers remain circumspect about whether the surge heralds a real recovery. From May 1 to Aug. 31, pre-foreclosure filings in the Hamptons jumped 31% to 294 from year-earlier levels, according to Long Island Profiles, a publisher of real-estate and foreclosure data. Summer sales were "mediocre at best," says Peter Turino of Brown Harris Stevens. "This is probably a temporary improvement. I think we'll have a very slow winter."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales jump partially reflects lower prices, but brokers say the increased activity also reflects changes on Wall Street, whose workers represent the largest proportion of Hamptons buyers. "I think word is that bonuses are going to be good," says Ms. Sander, who notes the buyers of her Sag Harbor home work in finance. "I think it gives them confidence to buy." The return of rank-and-file Wall Streeters helped activity increase most for homes under $6 million, considered here the middle-luxury tier of the market. Brokers say employees from <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, which recently reported net income of $3.44 billion for the quarter ended June 26, are particularly well-represented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone agrees that the Hamptons are a long way from total recovery. The median sale price of a home on Long Island's East End was $560,000 in the spring of this year, down 32% from the peak price of $825,000 in the first half of 2007, according to Suffolk Research. Inventory remains high: In August there were 4,900 homes for sale in the Hamptons, or roughly the equivalent of about three years of inventory, according to StreetEasy, a New York-based online listing service. Some seasoned brokers say pent-up demand and a delayed spring selling season are responsible for the summer surge in activity. The market is "going sideways," says Dottie Herman, president and CEO of Prudential Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the ultra-high end, sales remain rare. Former advertising executive-turned-car dealership mogul Carl Spielvogel and his wife, Barbaralee, are still trying to sell their 25-acre Southampton estate for $28 million. A five-acre estate on Southampton's Meadow Lane with a pool and tennis court is listed for $25.9 million; a similar property sold for $30.5 million two years ago. Some of the biggest sales were staged by government regulators, who successfully auctioned off the Southampton house of indicted former hedge-fund manager James Nicholson for $25.9 million. The Montauk home of Bernard Madoff garnered four bids and went into contract for more than its $8.75 million asking price after just two weeks on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, everyone is looking for the good deal. In Montauk, a 0.36-acre property went into contract three weeks ago for close to $1 million, about 44% off its original December 2008 asking price of $1.8 million. The buyer never set foot inside the 500-square-foot house, says listing agent Peter Moore of Corcoran, because he plans to tear it down. Nearby in Montauk, Charles Entenmann, whose family created the baked-goods empire, sold his home at 93 Prospect Hill Lane, for $2.2 million in July after originally asking $4.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while Wall Streeters still predominate, brokers say the new pricing also is enticing buyers from other fields. JoLee Sanchez, a 38-year-old homemaker whose husband is about to sell his general-contracting business, says she has seen 100 houses since she started shopping for an investment property "in the high 900s," in April. Southampton Village "would've been a little out of reach for us a couple of years ago," Ms. Sanchez says. Now, "with our circumstances the way they are, it's going to happen."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors expecting an upbeat chapter for housing should brace for a plot twist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two key pieces of housing data arrive this week, starting with August home resales, due Thursday from the National Association of Realtors. Economists think existing homes sold at an annualized rate of 5.39 million units last month, up 9% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, the Census Bureau reports new-home sales for August. Economists estimate an annualized sales pace of 440,000 units, flat from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both reports could add to a snowballing consensus that housing is rebounding. A vigorous recovery would be manna for the economy. Home sales spur purchases of fridges and lawn mowers, and rising prices make consumers wealthier and heal bank balance sheets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are reasons to expect a halting recovery at best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the recovery has leaned heavily on tax credits for first-time home buyers and the Federal Reserve's buying of most new mortgages to keep rates low. The Fed on Wednesday said it would slow its pace of purchases, and the tax credit is set to expire in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, an unemployment rate pushing 10% and tighter credit standards are a drag on housing demand, offsetting high affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More important, there are still too many houses on the market -- 9.4 months' worth of existing homes for sale in July, according to NAR data. The backlog is usually closer to six.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly seven million housing units will eventually enter foreclosure, mortgage-backed-securities strategists at <span class="companylink">Amherst Securities Group</span>, a brokerage firm that deals in MBS, estimated on Wednesday. That could add 1.35 years' worth of inventory to the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That isn't necessarily a bad thing. Foreclosure sales have provided steam for the broader housing recovery. But that momentum is petering out. Thanks partly to the effects of government loan-modification programs, there isn't enough foreclosure inventory on the market to keep the recent gains going, says Mark Hanson, president of the Field Check Group, a California research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California, for example, has seen its available foreclosure inventory slim. That could explain why, according to data tracker <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>, California home sales fell nearly 12% month-over-month in August.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For nearly 20 years, John Dotson planned to spend eternity at Block 29L, Lot 58, Site 1DD at Parklawn Memorial Park in Rockville, Md.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heaven will have to wait. Plagued by a series of misfortunes at home, from job loss to multiple illnesses, Mr. Dotson has decided to put the double plot he had bought for himself and his wife up for sale. "Things got really tight," he says, and his wife has come around to the idea of cremation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He purchased the plot in 1990 for about $1,500, and though the cemetery now values it at $4,555, Mr. Dotson says he would gladly unload it for around $2,800.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As if the recession hasn't ruined enough people's plans in this life, it now seems to be disrupting the hereafter as well. Cemeteries and funeral-property Web sites report a burgeoning marketplace for the sale of burial plots by individuals, many of which have been in families for years. As times get tough, they are now being liquidated to make ends meet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Orlando, Fla., Greenwood Cemetery has seen a record number of customers coming in to sell their plots back to the municipal-owned facility. Don Price, the cemetery's sexton, or manager, has had 44 "buybacks" in the first six months of this year, compared with 42 in all of last year and only 11 five years ago. Greenwood considers what a customer paid for the plot, and will offer as much as $1,500 if someone wishes to sell it back to the cemetery, which can then resell it on the open market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Dayton, Ohio, David's Cemetery reports that in the past year it has seen roughly double the number of clients coming in to sell their spaces back to the cemetery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Web sites such as Grave Solutions and Plot Brokers, which advertise spaces and broker sales of cemetery properties, have also seen an uptick in postings. Caskets-N-More, a Glendora, Calif.-based business that sells funeral products and brokers sales of cemetery properties, reports a doubling of people wanting to sell their plots, to about 20 new postings a month from 10 a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If a customer has something that's worth $3,000, that could pay for utility bills and living expenses," says Caskets-N-More owner Olga Fernandez. "They're not thinking of the future. They have something they're able to sell and get money for now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apparent increase in sellers of cemetery plots has to do with more than just economic necessity. Changes in how people live and wish to be buried also play a role. Increased mobility means individuals may no longer live near a family plot and would rather sell off unused spaces. And growing acceptance of cremation as an alternative to burial means people realize they may have no need for previously purchased in-ground plots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while many plots are sold that are no longer needed, other families are reluctantly giving up their plans of being buried near their loved ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've had widowers sell back spots next to their spouses, and only because they needed to pay rent," says Mr. Price, Greenwood's sexton. In such cases, the cemetery will pay for the space, but hold off on putting it on the market for a month, in case the seller is able to come up with the money to buy it back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Los Angeles-based Web site Plot Brokers is representing a family that wants to sell a multiplot area worth about $350,000 -- and is in the process of moving someone already buried there in order to sell. In recent months, Baron Chu, who runs Plot Brokers, has noticed a big increase in people willing to sell high-end plots -- an indication of how desperate some people are for funds. "Usually people that already have money aren't the ones looking for money," says Mr. Chu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crypt above screen siren Marilyn Monroe in Westwood Village Memorial Park in Los Angeles was posted for sale on <span class="companylink">eBay</span> on Aug. 14 with a starting bid of $500,000. By Aug. 24, bidding topped out at $4,602,100, though the offer, from Japan, was later rescinded. The plot hasn't yet sold, and <span class="companylink">eBay</span> is currently working with the seller in hopes of having her relist it, says a company spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plots sell quickest and cost the most in places where people tend to retire -- such as Florida, Arizona, Texas and Southern California -- according to Ken Brant, who runs the Grave Solutions Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, there are over 500 plots for sale on Grave Solutions for Restland Cemetery in Dallas, a 375-plus-acre facility owned by Jefferson, La.-based <span class="companylink">Stewart Enterprises Inc</span>. The listings reveal some potential bargains -- as well as sellers in a hurry: "REDUCED," reads one listing for a single plot in the Masonic section where the seller is asking $2,200. Another listing invites buyers to "make an offer" for two burial plots in the Garden of the Cross. Another seller is asking $4,500 each for his three plots in the Garden of Gospel -- or $12,000 if the buyer buys all of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One posting for Restland's desirable Whispering Waters section says $40,000 will buy you two "packages," complete with services, caskets (choice of copper tone or silver tone) and bronze memorial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so much inventory on the market, it could be a great time for a consumer to buy. Generally, sellers post plots for about half of what a comparable one would retail for at the cemetery. These days, because there is so much inventory, "people are much more willing to negotiate," says Jeff LaGrone, a Charlotte, N.C.-based cemetery-plot broker who helps run a Web site called American Cemetery Property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before buying property on the secondary market, you need to take some precautionary measures. First, make sure the seller is the owner of record with the cemetery. If he inherited the property from someone else, but neglected to alert the cemetery, for example, he likely can't transfer ownership until the books are straightened out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When selling property, check with the cemetery first to see what the rules are. For the most part, cemeteries will allow plot owners to sell their space on the secondary market -- though it's worth checking first to see if the cemetery itself will buy it back. (Most don't, says Robert Fells, general counsel for the International Cemetery, Cremation and Funeral Association, since cemeteries generally aren't lacking for spaces to sell.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When shopping, be sure to ask what's included in the price. Some properties include ancillary costs, such as the burial and headstone. Others include only the plot itself. Check with both the seller and cemetery about what exactly you are paying for. Mr. Dotson, for instance, is selling only for the rights to the land. The buyer would eventually need to pay for the two in-ground crypts, which together would cost an additional $2,340, as well as other fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another option: a so-called pre-need purchase, in which you purchase funeral arrangements, which may include cemetery space and funeral services, in advance of your death, before your survivors are grieving and easily fleeced by salesmen. But it also might not be a bad place to park your money, given how rapidly burial costs are escalating. Average funeral prices in the past decade have increased by about a third, to $6,199 (not including the cemetery plot), according to the Springfield, Ill.-based Federated Funeral Directors of America, which tracks costs annually.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing Recovery Obstacle: So Many Houses</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors expecting an upbeat chapter for housing should brace for a plot twist.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debra and Arthur Scriven were served notice in June 2008 that their mortgage lender, a unit of <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>., was preparing to foreclose on their home. Fifteen months later, the Scrivens are still in their home near Columbia, S.C., and battling to stay there, even though a dispute with the lender over how much they owe prompted them to stop making regular payments last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legal snarls, bureaucracy and well-meaning efforts to keep families in their homes are slowing the flow of properties headed toward foreclosure sales, even when borrowers are in deep distress. While that buys time for families to work out their problems, some analysts believe the delays are prolonging the mortgage crisis and creating a growing "shadow" inventory of pent-up supply that will eventually hit the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The size of this shadow inventory is a source of concern and debate among real-estate agents and analysts who worry that when the supply is unleashed, it could interrupt the budding housing recovery and ignite a new wave of stress in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's going to be a flood [of bank-owned homes] listed for sale at some point," says John Burns, a real-estate consultant based in Irvine, Calif. When that happens, Mr. Burns believes, home prices will fall further, particularly in markets with large numbers of foreclosures. Overall, he expects home prices to decline 6% next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ivy Zelman, chief executive of Zelman &amp;Associates, a research firm based in Cleveland, believes three million to four million foreclosed homes will be put up for sale in the next few years. The question is whether the flow of these homes onto the market will resemble "a fire hose or a garden hose or a drip," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts who track the shadow market have focused primarily on the gap between the number of seriously delinquent loans and the number of foreclosed homes for sale by mortgage companies. A loan is considered seriously delinquent, which typically means it is headed to foreclosure, if it is 90 days or more past due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of July, mortgage companies hadn't begun the foreclosure process on 1.2 million loans that were at least 90 days past due, according to estimates prepared for The Wall Street Journal by LPS Applied Analytics, which collects and analyzes mortgage data. An additional 1.5 million seriously delinquent loans were somewhere in the foreclosure process, though the lender hadn't yet acquired the property. The figures don't include home-equity loans and other second mortgages</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, there were 217,000 loans in July where the borrower hadn't made a payment in at least a year but the lender hadn't begun the foreclosure process. In other words, 17% of home mortgages that are at least 12 months overdue aren't in foreclosure, up from 8% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some borrowers may be able to catch up on their payments or receive a loan modification that helps them keep their home. There has also been an increase in short-sales, transactions in which at-risk borrowers sell their homes for less than the loan amount, with the lender's approval. In some cases, lenders have decided not to foreclose because the home's value is so low. These factors could mean fewer foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosed homes are partly responsible for the recent increase in home sales. But foreclosures also push down home values. According to Collateral Analytics, a housing research firm, homes that have been foreclosed on typically sell at a 10% to 50% discount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the delays have led to what is probably a temporary drop in the supply of bank-owned homes in California and other places where investors and first-time home buyers have been competing for bargains. In Orange County, Calif., the number of bank-owned homes listed for sale dropped to 322 in early September from 1,404 in November 2008, according to Altera Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the number of foreclosures is expected to increase in the fourth quarter as mortgage-servicing companies determine who is eligible for a loan modification and who isn't. "We are going to see a spike from now to the end of the year in foreclosures as we take people out of the running" for a loan modification or other alternatives, says a <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. spokeswoman. Foreclosure sales had dropped to "abnormally low" levels in response to government efforts to stem foreclosures, she adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Scrivens, legal battles have complicated the process. Ms. Scrivens says <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> recently offered to modify their loan, but she and her husband rejected the offer because they objected to some of the conditions. A hearing on the foreclosure case is scheduled for Wednesday in a Kershaw County, S.C., court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing customer privacy, a <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> spokesman declined to comment specifically on the Scrivens situation. "Our priority goal is to keep distressed borrowers in their homes and out of foreclosure, when possible," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the housing bubble, a quaint notion held sway that homeowners should be able to afford the houses they live in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One measure of affordability is to compare property prices with per capita personal income. Karl Case, co-creator of the Case-Shiller Home Price indexes, has tracked this for 20 major metropolitan areas. During the 1990s, most held steady in a range of four to six times income. But lax monetary policy and credit standards after that helped throw the notion of affordability out the window.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities like Miami and Phoenix are particularly noteworthy. After a long period of stable midsingle-digit price-to-income ratios, these exploded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most cities now have returned to "normal" ranges. Even so, don't bank on this portending a house-price rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sanity hasn't returned everywhere: Los Angeles still boasts a ratio of nearly 10 times. Moreover, the collapse of the bubble should recalibrate expectations. The relative stability of price-to-income ratios prior to the bubble, together with stagnant incomes and rising unemployment, suggests prices in many areas are about where they should be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Against this stands Uncle Sam. Some four-fifths of new residential mortgages this year have benefited from government support, said trade journal Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government interventions remain a wild card. But it is worth noting that efforts to date have helped stabilize price-to-income ratios in their normal range. Without this, prices likely would have plunged further. In Detroit, the ratio has dropped below the historic range of four to five times. Banking on a big housing bounce-back on the back of Washington's grand fiscal experiment looks highly questionable. Quaint, even.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Glenn Ruffenach  </div><div>2037 words</div><div>19 September 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>R1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sitting in his office in Fayetteville, Ga., Ken Steele, the town's mayor, is poring over a local street map, explaining how this suburb of Atlanta hopes to transform itself into a "lifelong community" -- and why neighborhoods across the country need to do the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every small community has the same problem," says Mr. Steele, age 69. "We want residents to be able to age in place, to meet their needs . . . here, without having to move away."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that end, he indicates on the map how a new street grid could reduce traffic in the center of town and help Fayetteville become a "walking community"; how new town homes and condominiums, in an area where single-family homes have long been the norm, could give residents of all ages more housing options; and how new greenways and parks could promote social interaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Lenders, landowners, developers -- they're all talking now," Mr. Steele says of the project. "We really can't afford to wait."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sense of urgency is understandable. The nation's sprawling suburbs -- home to as much as half of the U.S. population and more than 30 million people age 55-plus -- may have been a good place to grow up. But the suburbs are proving a tough place to grow old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, as the country ages, suburbia's widely assumed benefits -- privacy, elbow room, affordability -- tend to vanish. Maintaining yards and homes requires more effort; driving everywhere, and for everything, becomes expensive and, eventually, impossible. (Research shows that men and women who reach their 70s, on average, outlive their ability to drive by six and 10 years, respectively.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even something as simple as the absence of sidewalks can discourage older adults from walking through their neighborhoods and seeing other people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suddenly, "all that privacy that drew people to the suburbs in the first place can become isolation," says Ellen Dunham-Jones, associate professor of architecture and urban design at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One answer, of course, is to leave. Active-adult communities and assisted-living facilities exist to mitigate some of the drawbacks of growing old on a cul-de-sac. That said, the vast majority of older adults don't want to move. Fully 85% of surveyed individuals age 50-plus told AARP, the Washington-based advocacy group, that they wish to remain in their communities for as long as possible. And those communities, invariably, want the same thing: a strong mix of ages, interests and abilities among residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps a better solution, and one finding favor in more circles, is the idea of "retrofitting" suburbia and developing, as seen on the drawing board in Fayetteville, "lifelong communities." Such projects typically involve taking a neighborhood or site within an existing town or suburb and creating a compact, walkable community -- one with alternatives to single-family homes, such as condominiums or row houses. Ideally, older residents in large homes will have the option of downsizing and remaining in a community where they can access restaurants, shopping and other amenities and services on foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As simple or as practical as that idea might sound, reshaping suburbia requires elected officials like Mr. Steele, as well as planners, developers, architects and builders, to address a host of issues. They can be as large as transportation networks and zoning codes, and as small as the type of cooktop installed in a condominium's new kitchen, one that has to be safe for people ages nine through 90.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"From the region down to the doorknob -- that's the challenge: integrating it all," says Andres Duany, co-founder of Duany Plater-Zyberk &amp;Co., an international planning and architectural firm based in Miami, and a leading voice in efforts to retrofit suburbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How does a suburb go about making itself more livable for older adults? Here's how several efforts are playing out -- and what your suburban community might look like in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Priorities</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea of lifelong communities grew out of New Urbanism, a design movement started in the 1980s. Neighborhood centers (think: town squares), "walkability" (leaving the car in the garage) and lots of choices (a mix of housing options, services and amenities) are emphasized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such communities, of course, are often built from scratch. One early and prominent example is the Florida beach town of Seaside, with its much-photographed cottages and public spaces. But existing towns and suburbs can add features as well, like pedestrian-friendly thoroughfares and more diversified housing, which allow people to age in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We aren't proposing to demolish entire single-family neighborhoods," says Prof. Dunham-Jones at Georgia Tech. Rather, "the idea is to revitalize an area by inserting more choices for people, especially more urban choices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One such retrofit is taking place in Lakewood, Colo., a large suburb (population 147,000) west of Denver. In the late 1990s, an indoor shopping mall in town had started losing stores, customers and sales. In 2002, local officials and developers began converting the 104-acre site into a mixed-use neighborhood, called Belmar, where people could live, work and play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Belmar is 22 blocks of "urban choices" -- offices, homes, shops, restaurants and entertainment -- set in the heart of suburbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The change is pretty dramatic," says Mike Rock, retired city manager of Lakewood who helped direct Belmar's development. "Buildings are pulled right up to the sidewalk; residential living is above the retail outlets. You don't expect to see this in a suburban setting."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shoppers, office workers and residents fill the development's public plaza, park and mix of nearly 800 apartments, lofts, row homes and condominiums. (The total is expected to reach about 1,300 in 2012.) In spring and summer, a street market features fare from local farmers and gourmet shops; in winter, the community's one-acre plaza becomes an ice-skating rink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rock, 61 years old, settled in Belmar when the development opened. For him and many others, he says, the draws are convenience and diversity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many weekends, my wife and I don't use the car," he says. Movies, an athletic club, a coffee house and restaurants are all within walking distance. "I regularly see people who are 10 years older than me -- and 30 years younger," he adds. "I like that. I like the vibrancy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, research has shown that many suburbanites, despite their attachment to big homes in big yards, are looking for features found in developments like Belmar. In a survey of 1,600 primarily suburban households in Atlanta and Boston, Jonathan Levine, a professor of urban and regional planning at the University of Michigan, found that about one-third of Atlantans and about four in 10 Bostonians liked the idea of having public transit and pedestrian environments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five to Watch</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the most ambitious effort in the U.S. to develop lifelong communities is taking place in and around Atlanta. The city and its suburbs, like much of the country, are staring at a substantial increase in the 60-plus population. By 2030, one out of every five residents in the Atlanta region will be 60 or older, up from one in 10 today. But the region is short on manpower and money to accommodate older adults' needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accordingly, the Atlanta Regional Commission, the planning agency for the 10-county metropolitan area, is working with architects, developers and local officials to design communities where, in the words of the commission, "people of all ages and abilities can live as long as they would like." Ideally, the efforts will serve as a template for other suburban "retrofits" across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five lifelong communities are on the drawing boards. Created by Duany Plater-Zyberk, the Miami firm, each starts with an existing setting -- a suburb or small town, for instance -- and, first, "repairs" the local infrastructure. Typically, that involves changing street grids to connect neighborhoods and making it easier to walk to services and amenities. Next, the plans add features -- social spaces, housing, shops, transportation options, recreation and entertainment facilities -- that help address the needs of an aging population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan for Fayetteville, the town south of Atlanta, calls for new "greenway paths" for pedestrians, a shuttle bus to shopping and health-care services, and improved links among neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there's the showstopper: taking a 38-acre undeveloped site that in the past might have supported 38 single-family homes, and wedging in more than 200 housing units, including town homes and condominiums, around a neighborhood square. For older Fayetteville residents with large homes, it could be an attractive option for remaining in the community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That kind of development and density are "unheard of" in the Fayetteville area, says Jan Trammell, a local builder and developer. But "we can't keep doing what we've been doing," she adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Space is something we thought we had to have" in the suburbs, says Ms. Trammell, age 74. "But we can't afford that today -- time-wise or money-wise. Putting a single house on a one-acre lot means more street in front of that house, longer electric and gas lines to run to the house, more yard and shrubs to cut, and a bigger property-tax bill for the owners. We're all tired of that. I know I am."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turning blueprints into reality, however, will require a lot of convincing and arm-twisting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are 'nuggets' of good things happening," says Elinor Ginzler, senior vice president for livable communities at AARP. "But how often do you find a community design that allows you to live, shop, work and have [access to] services in a consolidated area? As people get older, that's quite a challenge."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles Krautler, director of the Atlanta Regional Commission, rattles off a list of the hurdles local governments face: the competing needs of different groups ("The elderly want Meals on Wheels and senior centers, but that's not what the baby boomers want."); zoning codes that have to change; local opposition that views some building plans as "fairly radical," such as multifamily housing; and educating the many parties involved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a recent planning meeting in Mableton, Ga., another of the five sites in the greater Atlanta project, Stephen Macauley, a local developer, goes through a partial list of the "stakeholders" involved: Mableton residents, county commissioners, state and local departments of transportation, planning and zoning officials, the local economic development office, the parks and recreation department, county schools, a Baptist church, a regional library -- and, possibly, a local garden club. Not to mention landowners, architects and builders. "If we do this right, we can create a model for many, many communities," Mr. Macauley says. "The challenge is getting all these players to work together."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financing, too, comes up at the Mableton meeting -- as it does with every retrofit. Redesigning the nation's suburbs will be costly (Belmar in Colorado will top out at about $850 million), and the current economic climate would seem to throttle most ambitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But speaking in June to a gathering of local officials in Atlanta, Mr. Duany, the architect, said the recession actually was forcing planners, builders and developers to look beyond traditional designs and begin considering what towns and neighborhoods should look like in the next 50 years. That includes shaping lifelong communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Planning has been based on wealth," he said at the meeting. "We would build six lanes just to go to <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>; we would throw infrastructure and services after people, which was incredibly inefficient."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But "this recession has given us a chance to think. It's a wonderful opportunity to get things done that you couldn't get done just two or three years ago."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose slightly in August, but a decline in construction of single-family homes after five months of increases highlighted the fragile state of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in a positive sign, the pace of layoffs slowed as initial claims for jobless benefits dropped by 12,000 to 545,000 in the week ended Sept. 12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts climbed 1.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 598,000 in August from the previous month on an increase in multifamily home construction, the Commerce Department said Thursday. But single-family homes, which accounted for about 80% of all housing starts, fell 3% to 479,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists expect home building to contribute positively to gross domestic product in the second half of the year, after dragging it down last quarter. But even with the recent gains, new home starts were 29.6% lower than a year earlier, and they are expected to remain at relatively low levels while the market works through the glut of foreclosed homes and builders battle a tight credit market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a more positive note, building permits, a sign of future construction, increased 2.7% in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 579,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts of multifamily homes with five or more units rose 35.3% in August after falling in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A modest rebound from such a depressed level of activity is not too surprising," <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> analysts wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The labor market continued on its slow road to recovery as the four-week average of new claims for jobless benefits, which aims to smooth volatility, fell by 8,750 to 563,000, the Labor Department said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But continuing jobless claims, those drawn by workers for more than one week, climbed to 6.23 million in the week ended Sept. 5 -- up 129,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. housing starts rose to their highest level in nine months during August, helped by a surge in apartment construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts climbed 1.5% to a seasonally adjusted 598,000 annual rate compared with the prior month, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Building permits, a sign of future groundbreakings, rose 2.7% last month to a 579,000 annual rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1.5% increase in starts was less than expected, as single-family starts fell. Still, the increase in August was the third in four months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At least the numbers are moving in the right direction," High Frequency Economics analyst Ian Shepherdson said of Thursday's starts data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales have gone up for four straight months, despite a rising U.S. unemployment rate that hit 9.7% in August. A Labor Department report Thursday said the number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits fell by 12,000 to 545,000 last week. But continuing claims -- those drawn by workers for more than one week -- rose 129,000 the week before last to 6.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family starts in August fell 3% from July to 479,000. Construction of housing with two or more units jumped 25.3% to 119,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks edged lower Thursday as major indexes took a breather from this week's rally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 7.79 points, or 0.1%, lower at 9783.92, while the Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 0.3% to 2126.75 and the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500-stock index was down 0.3% at 1065.49.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anthony Conroy, head trader at <span class="companylink">BNY ConvergEx</span>, a New York brokerage, said the expectations of many traders for a market pullback may have finally caught up with stocks Thursday. But he was skeptical that a textbook correction including a 10% decline in major indexes is ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market has acted so well lately that I can't imagine it coming in too much," Mr. Conroy said. "Anytime it's down, you have guys waiting in the wings to get in."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though most economic news has been favorable for stocks lately, Thursday's data were mixed. Housing starts rose a less-than-expected 1.5% compared to the prior month as single-family home construction fell and groundbreakings on new apartment buildings rebounded. Permits for new buildings climbed 2.7%. Economists had expected permits to rise by 4.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a more promising note, the number of workers filing new claims for jobless benefits fell by 12,000 last week. Economists had expected an increase in claims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late-afternoon trade, <span class="companylink">American Airlines</span> parent AMR was up 19% after it said it had raised $2.9 billion in funding, repairing its balance sheet and potentially paving the way to buy a stake in <span class="companylink">Japan Airlines</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apple touched a 52-week high of $186.79 after NPD Group reported the initial two weeks of Apple's Snow Leopard operating system sales were at least double the first two-week tallies of Apple's two previous software systems. Late afternoon, the software company's shares were up 1.7% at $184.95.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude-oil futures settled four cents, or 0.1%, lower at $72.47 a barrel on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing Seems Set to Aid Economy a Bit</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After facilitating the economy's downfall, the housing sector will soon start helping its recovery, though probably not by much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Census Bureau data on August housing starts are due Thursday morning. Economists think starts rose 3.3% from June to an annualized rate of 600,000 units, the fastest pace since November 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A tentative recovery in home construction might be enough to boost annualized gross-domestic-product growth by as much as 0.5 percentage point, according to some estimates, perhaps as soon as this quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would be an impressive turn of events. Collapsing residential construction slashed nearly one percentage point, on average, from GDP growth for the past 3 1/2 years in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That starts are gaining ground might seem quizzical, as there is still an oversupply of housing on the market, including a large "shadow" inventory of homes that will eventually enter foreclosure or that are being held off the market while their owners wait for prices to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many unsold homes might be too large for the first-time buyers that have boosted the market in recent months, spurred by government tax credits, suggests Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. Home builders can make smaller houses to meet that demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there are limits to how much activity is likely to be seen. Builders remain cautious. Though their sentiment has improved, it is still near record lows, according to the latest survey by the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">August's expected gain would still leave starts down 29% from a year ago and down 74% from the 2.27 million-unit record pace set in January 2006, at the height of the bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> economists, weighing population growth, inventory and still-high home-vacancy rates, estimate there might be just 850,000 housing starts in 2010 -- roughly the pace before the <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> collapse a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That suggests there mightn't be much more juice in home-builder stocks. The Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Total Stock Market Index has more than doubled from its November bottom and is near pre-Lehman levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also suggests housing's contribution to GDP will be minimal.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Treasury, responding to the growing pain in the commercial real-estate industry, released new tax rules that make it easier for distressed property owners to restructure loans that were packaged by Wall Street firms and sold as securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most in the real-estate industry, which lobbied intensely for the move, applauded the action. But some warned it has opened a Pandora's box, especially for servicers of the securities who will likely come under new pressure from borrowers and competing classes of investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move is the first round of "additional guidance" the Treasury is weighing to stave off what many fear will be a commercial real-estate crisis, according to people familiar with the matter. A Treasury spokesman declined to comment. A record of more than $150 billion of loans bundled into commercial-mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, will come due between now and 2012. But as financing remains scarce and values of offices, strip malls, hotels and other types of commercial property continue to drop, more property owners are finding it hard to refinance debt as it matures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now, tax rules have made it difficult for borrowers who are current on their payments to hold restructuring talks with the servicers of these bonds. Developers and investors complain that only those who are delinquent can talk to the servicers. Indeed, many property owners -- notably mall giant <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties Inc</span>., now in bankruptcy protection -- have cited this lack of flexibility as one of the reasons for having to default on debt and give up properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new guidance from the Treasury makes it clear discussions involving lowering the interest rate or stretching out the loan term "may occur at any time" without triggering tax consequences. In addition, the guidance allows servicers to modify loans regardless of when they mature. The servicer only has to believe there is "a significant risk of default" even if the loan is performing, the guidance states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A stalemate now exists on CMBS loans that are not currently in default but need modification," said Jeffrey DeBoer, chief executive of the Real Estate Roundtable, a lobbying body for property owners and investors. "Today's announcement should help break the stalemate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some investors holding CMBS bonds are watching nervously because loan modifications, known as "mods," mightn't always be in their best interest. CMBS have junior and senior pieces, and the senior holders may be in a better position, when a borrower defaults, to foreclose and liquidate the property rather than modify the loan. Junior holders, on the other hand, might benefit from a mod because they mightn't get their money back in a forced sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The standards of care for services are to all bondholders," says Patrick Sargent, president of the Commercial Mortgage Securities Association, a trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, servicers are required by their contracts to act in the interests of the investors and modify loans only when that can be expected to reduce losses. That puts servicers in the tricky position of trying to figure out which borrowers are basically sound and when it makes more sense to foreclose quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The biggest concern is that the guidance could open the floodgate for everyone to try to get some sort of loan modifications," said Aaron Bryson, a CMBS analyst at <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>. "There is a tremendous burden on the servicers to uphold their end of the bargain."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the move by the Treasury reflects the deep concern in government and industry circles over the problems looming in the $6.5 trillion market for commercial real estate. Just as the U.S. economy is struggling to regain its footing, defaults are mounting because of credit-market turmoil, along with declining property cash flows and plunging property values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, the Treasury also is considering "additional guidance" aimed at fending off a potential wave of defaults as more commercial mortgages come due, the people with knowledge of the matter said. The real-estate industry has been pressing for a tax law change that would encourage more foreign investments in commercial property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now, property owners and investors hoping to restructure troubled mortgages were hearing a tough message from most CMBS servicers: We can't talk to you unless you first fall behind on payments. This is because when CMBS offerings are created, the underlying mortgages are legally held by tax-free trusts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trusts could have been forced to pay taxes if the underlying loans were modified before they became delinquent, according to the old CMBS rules. The new guidance applies to CMBS loans modified on or after Jan. 1, 2008.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly one year after Seattle was rocked by the largest bank failure in U.S. history, the city has gotten a consolation prize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many office towers are languishing on the market nationwide for lack of credit and buyers, <span class="companylink">Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co</span>. of Milwaukee has stepped up and paid <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co</span>. $115 million in cash for most of the largely empty 42-story office complex that once housed the headquarters of <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual Inc</span>., the collapsed Seattle thrift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northwestern also will usher a new employer into the Emerald City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Russell Investments</span>, the investment-management firm known for its widely used stock indexes and a Northwestern subsidiary, will relocate its headquarters from Tacoma, Wash., next year. Russell, a company that Tacoma fought to keep, is expected to occupy about 300,000 square feet in the complex at 1301 Second Ave. It is a short walk from Pike Place Market, a favorite tourist hangout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The former <span class="companylink">WaMu</span> Center building -- designed by NBBJ, which also designed the new Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation headquarters -- will be renamed the <span class="companylink">Russell Investments</span> Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's outstanding for the city of Seattle to have someone who has invested in real estate in such a down market," says Tim Ceis, the city's deputy mayor. "It's a shot in the arm both psychologically as well as financially."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city also has a direct stake in the building's future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Completed in 2006, the <span class="companylink">WaMu</span> tower was built next to the Seattle Art Museum. A spokeswoman for the art museum says it built and expanded its museum space into part of a second, lower tower that is adjacent to the former <span class="companylink">WaMu</span> Center. The museum owns the bottom 12 floors of the tower, of which it previously leased about 240,000 square feet to <span class="companylink">WaMu</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space that had been leased by <span class="companylink">WaMu</span> was financed with about $60 million in city-guaranteed bonds, Mr. Ceis says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>, which acquired the <span class="companylink">WaMu</span> Center building as part of its $1.9 billion acquisition of <span class="companylink">WaMu</span>'s banking operations, didn't try to lease the space because it wanted to sell the building, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the city hopes Northwestern will crank up the marketing program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northwestern appears to have gotten a bargain compared with what the property would have fetched in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At roughly $133 a square foot, Northwestern paid less than half the average price of about $320 a square foot fetched by larger Seattle area office properties near the market peak in 2007, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a New York real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northwestern, with a real-estate equity portfolio valued at about $5.8 billion in June, said the acquisition is one of its first major purchases this year. Tom Zale, managing director of real estate for Northwestern, says the lower cost of buying the asset will give the company some breathing room to beef up the property's bottom line. However, he said the long-term prognosis for the Seattle market is very promising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The short-term outlook, though, isn't that great.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second-quarter vacancies in the city rose to 20.4%, well above the Seattle metrowide average of 17.4%, according to Property &amp;Portfolio Research Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the problem: <span class="companylink">J.P.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craig Kinzer, president of Kinzer Real Estate Services, which led Russell's site search, said Russell began considering the building last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When James Dimon, chief executive of J.P. Morgan Chase, visited Seattle last year, Mr. Ceis recalls asking Mr. Dimon to take the city and museum's interest in the property into consideration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> declined to comment on the meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kinzer says <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> subsequently negotiated with Russell for months without putting the complex officially on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have a city reeling from the loss of <span class="companylink">WaMu</span> and <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> saying, 'What can we do to help you as long as we get a market price?"' Mr. Kinzer says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, Mr. Kinzer says, Northwestern "bought it empty and added value the day it closed."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year after <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>' collapse, the firm overseeing its bankruptcy is moving to restructure loans for 900 properties to help salvage a battered $16 billion real-estate portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moves -- involving commercial real-estate properties ranging from huge apartment holdings to office buildings to a Miami condominium complex -- portend the strategies big U.S. banks are likely to undertake as they deal with their own troubled loans and buildings over the next 18 months, specialists say. In some cases, Lehman is generating new loans or even agreeing to buy condominium mortgages to keep projects afloat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The massive restructuring of a portfolio that contributed to Lehman's bankruptcy also has turned up fresh details of the mess Lehman has on its hands. The Lehman holdings now in U.S. bankruptcy court dropped in value by an estimated $5.4 billion between the weekend it filed for bankruptcy and Dec. 31, stemming from a deteriorating market and overly lofty "marks," or valuations, by Lehman before the bankruptcy, according to court proceedings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, Lehman may be forced to wait until the property market improves. "It's not a great time to sell today," says Bryan Marsal, chief restructuring officer and chief executive at Lehman and head of Alvarez &amp;Marsal, the advisory firm overseeing Lehman's bankruptcy proceedings. But he adds: "We aren't passively waiting for a better market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman's restructuring efforts could provide a template for other banks. U.S. banks and thrifts hold more than $1.2 trillion in commercial mortgages backed by offices, hotels, shopping malls and apartments, according to <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span>. Now, with property values down and credit still scarce, losses for the commercial-property lenders could total $115 billion to $150 billion, according to a Deutsche report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman's restructuring team faces a tough road. As the big securities firm bulked up its real-estate holdings, it ended up holding, for example, at least $2 billion in Florida real-estate projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 66 people overseeing the Lehman portfolio, in addition to 250 outside contractors, represent the "biggest real-estate workout department in the U.S.," Mr. Marsal says. Inside his office, a whiteboard details the projects his firm has been working on as it deals with creditors and federal bankruptcy court to wind down Lehman. Mr. Marsal said it could take three to five years to work through the loans and equity stakes in properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The workout process is creating haves and have-nots. Among the Lehman borrowers that haven't been successful in restructuring loans are developers of a Tennessee golf-and-residential development, according to documents filed in the Lehman bankruptcy proceedings. The loan for the project ended up with a Lehman unit in Bermuda and is being overseen in separate court proceedings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers have stopped the project with just nine of 18 holes completed. Philip Jones, president of Tentara Partners Inc., which is overseeing the project, said, "This project will be successful once all this is behind us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New details also are emerging about the borrowers that did business with Lehman. Among them is Las Vegas developer Kenneth Jowdy. Mr. Jowdy and other investors used Lehman loans to fund sprawling golf-course and residential developments in Mexico, Texas and Tennessee. Investors in one project allege in a suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in June that Mr. Jowdy falsified financial statements as part of his loan application to Lehman for the Mexican project and that Mr. Jowdy arranged for porn stars and strippers to attend company-funded functions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group suing Mr. Jowdy allege Mr. Jowdy mismanaged the project and wasted millions of dollars. A spokesman for Mr. Jowdy said the Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, project is on track and a golf course will be open next month. The spokesman also said the suit offers no proof porn stars and strippers were hired. The spokesman says the lawsuit's allegations "are preposterous, absurd and not based in fact."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, distressed-debt buyers such as hedge fund <span class="companylink">Paulson &amp;Co</span>. have acquired Lehman debt and formed an ad-hoc creditors group monitoring Mr. Marsal's moves, calling for more disclosure to ensure creditors are kept up to date on decisions that could affect their return. A Lehman spokeswoman said the restructuring team has been communicating with all creditors and providing information in public filings as required by bankruptcy law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An advantage for Mr. Marsal is that the bankrupt Lehman doesn't have to worry about big write-downs. Other banks are less willing to take write-downs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. banks have been unwilling to restructure real-estate loans because that would force them to mark down the value of their holdings and lead to increased capital costs, according to many specialists. Mr. Marsal says the loan restructurings that Lehman is undertaking today are a window into the types of loan workouts other banks will pursue this year and next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of banks don't want to take write-downs and take over properties. Now we're out of the business, so we don't have that [concern]," Mr. Marsal says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman's efforts to deal with a Miami condominium project provide one look into how Mr. Marsal's firm is operating. In 2006 and 2007, Lehman and a subsidiary provided more than $522 million in construction and mezzanine loans to Miami developer WSG Development Co., which planned to use the money to build a 580-condominium project called Canyon Ranch Living Miami Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea behind the project was that condo buyers would be able to utilize spa facilities managed by Canyon Ranch, a well-known health and fitness facility operator. But by 2008 the project was stalled. Just 209 units had been sold, so there wasn't enough money for WSG to repay debts owed to Lehman and its subsidiary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman had its own problems in 2008 as it tried to raise cash and stay afloat. In the spring of last year, for example, the Lehman subsidiary used the construction loans on the Miami project as collateral for a $238.9 million loan from <span class="companylink">Fortress Investment Group LLC</span>, the private-equity and hedge-fund group that specializes in distressed debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To close that loan, the Lehman subsidiary agreed to pay outsize interest of London interbank offered rate plus 6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To prevent Fortress from foreclosing on the condo complex and to end the high interest payments due to Fortress, Lehman's restructuring team got court approval in June to pay off the Fortress loan. Fortress didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Marsal and his team faced another difficult choice. The Lehman unit had the option to foreclose on the project, but Lehman's restructuring team would have faced the same challenges in trying to sell the condos, according to court papers. So Lehman and Mr. Marsal launched a "mortgage financing program" that effectively puts Lehman back in the condo-lending business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under a plan that received court approval, a lender is providing loans to condo borrowers and Lehman has agreed to purchase as much as $200 million worth of the condo loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Marsal says sales have perked and that 32 units have been sold since May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some restructuring moves also are helping other banks that had teamed with Lehman. One stems from the October 2007 purchase of Archstone-Smith, a real-estate investment trust that owns 70,000 residential units, by a partnership between Lehman and Tishman Speyer Properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To complete the deal, Lehman, <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Barclays PLC</span> arranged $15 billion in financing, $9 billion of which was sold to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. When the mortgage market seized up, Lehman retained about $3 billion of the loans, while <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> kept $1.7 billion and <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> held about $1.5 billion, according to Lehman's bankruptcy documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon after the deal closed, stock prices of apartment REITs fell sharply. Last year Archstone was generating cash, but not enough from apartment rent or selling assets to pay interest on the debt. If the Archstone project fell into default, the lenders would have to put the debt on nonaccrual status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a move supported by <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>, Lehman sought bankruptcy-court approval to provide Archstone $485 million in additional funding. Representatives for <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That new funding, including $227 million from Lehman and the rest from <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, now is covering the interest costs to the banks in what is effectively a circular movement of cash that keeps the loan current.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AFTER a year of extraordinary interventions in the economy, the U.S. government is starting to pare its support for the private sector. It doesn't look that way to Peter Lansing, president of mortgage firm Universal Lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Denver home lender sees every day how dependent the housing market has become on the government. At the height of the boom, just 20% of Universal's mortgages were backed by the Federal Housing Administration, an arm of the government that guarantees loans to borrowers who can't afford big down payments. Today, the FHA accounts for more than 80% of his business. For Mr. Lansing, this represents a new way of life -- more government, more paperwork, but also a lot of sales that wouldn't have happened otherwise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Over 29 years in business, we've always thought of ourselves as being in the free-enterprise system. Today I think of myself as a government contractor," Mr. Lansing says. "My business strategy is to get more of my employees to embrace that idea. Plan B would be to sell pencils on the corner."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech on Wall Street a year after <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> collapsed, President Barack Obama said Monday the need for the government to keep stabilizing the financial system "is waning." His administration released a 51-page report detailing rescue programs that are slowly being scaled back. But the Treasury Department, author of the report, noted that housing is one area where it is too early to exit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year, the government has intervened heavily at essentially every stage of the home-buying process. In fact, more than 80% of the new residential mortgage loans made this year benefited from some form of government support, according to the trade publication Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To keep funds flowing to the housing market, the government bailed out <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> last year and now effectively owns the mortgage-finance giants and their combined $5.4 trillion in loans and guarantees. To keep mortgage rates low, the Federal Reserve is on track to purchase nearly $1.5 trillion in debt issued or guaranteed by the government's various mortgage arms and an additional $300 billion in Treasurys, which set the benchmark for home lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And to boost sales, the government also is offering $8,000 tax credits to first-time home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those efforts appear to have had the intended effect of braking the housing market's plunge. They prompted Jonathan Swinton and his wife, Annie, to plunge into the market ahead of schedule. The couple plans to close on a $226,000 home in a suburb of Salt Lake City in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had always wanted to buy a home, but we had been planning to wait a couple of years," says Mr. Swinton, who recently completed course work for a Ph.D. in family therapy and is now working at a mental-health facility in Salt Lake City. "The low interest rates and the tax credit were the two primary factors that motivated us to buy this year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of a housing-market bottom have emerged. Sales of new homes are up more than 30% from lows reached early this year, and sales of existing homes are up nearly 17%. Shares of companies that build homes have turned higher, inventories of unsold new homes are down and home prices have ticked up after steep declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's efforts are the primary reason the housing market is functioning at all, economists and housing experts say. Despite the signs of improvement, the housing market is still a shell of what it was during headier times. U.S. home prices are back around 2003 levels, having fallen by about one-third since their peak in the second quarter of 2006, according to <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>. Sales of distressed homes still account for about one-third of existing home sales, and prices continue to fall in some markets such as the Sun Belt states. In addition, relatively few "jumbo" loans are being made -- those above the limits of what Fannie and Freddie will buy or guarantee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At least for the next two years, and possibly longer, it is not possible that the government would say: 'The U.S. mortgage market no longer needs our support,'" says Dwight Jaffee, an economics professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. "Were they to say that, the mortgage market and the housing market would almost surely crash."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Promoting homeownership has been a stated goal of Republican and Democratic presidencies for decades. The Obama administration recognizes it will need -- at some point -- to rethink broadly the government's role in housing and mortgages. Administration officials also acknowledge that moment won't come soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every government in the world takes a role in its country's housing market," says Lawrence Summers, Mr. Obama's top economic-policy adviser. "What that role should be when normal conditions return is a crucial question we'll all be considering in coming months and coming years." He added: "It's clearly going to take time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's role in housing has a long pedigree. The 1930s gave birth to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and the FHA, which traditionally insured loans aimed at low-income borrowers. <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> was created in 1970. Since the housing crash, these players are in some spots the only game in town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their backing means private lenders are assured of repayment -- by the government, if not the borrower. The size of loan that can be guaranteed is capped in most parts of the U.S. at $417,000, but can reach as high as $729,750 in high-cost areas such as parts of California, New York and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loans above those levels are hard to obtain. Steve Walsh, a mortgage broker in Arizona, said he recently tried to arrange a mortgage for a married couple who wanted to buy a $1.5 million home in Mesa. The couple offered a down payment of $400,000, but the lender wanted $600,000, or 40%, in part because the couple had opened a law firm and didn't have two years of tax returns. That is double what was considered standard before the boom. The pair walked away, Mr. Walsh said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government temporarily raised the size of the loans Fannie and Freddie can guarantee in February 2008 and is unlikely to ever return to previous levels. The higher levels have been extended once, and the mortgage industry is lobbying to keep them high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Fed, the question of whether to start dismantling the scaffolding is a dominant one. Since the beginning of the year, the Fed has purchased $836 billion of mortgage-backed securities issued by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and Ginnie Mae, the federal body that securitizes FHA loans. The purchases have helped push down interest rates on mortgages guaranteed by the firms from more than 6.5% last October to 5.15% today, according to HSH Associates, which tracks the mortgage market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That seems to have helped to put a floor under housing sooner than many officials expected. At the same time, it has created distortions in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Fed buys as much as $30 billion in mortgage securities every week, regardless of price, "it makes it very difficult for the market to find its own equilibrium," says Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of U.S. fixed-income research at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>. He said investors are trading instead in Treasury securities, where activity is less skewed by central-bank purchases, and pushing rates lower in that market, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed is likely to decide to carry on buying until it reaches the $1.25 trillion target it set in March and taper off the buying gradually. Some Fed officials will likely argue for stopping sooner, even as soon as next week's regular policy meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Fed stops sooner than expected, it could jolt the mortgage market and short-circuit a housing recovery. <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>'s Mr. Rajadhyaksha estimates that even if the Fed carries on as planned, mortgage rates will rise by half to three-quarters of a percentage point, simply because the Fed will cease to be as a big a presence in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed will face a challenge managing its portfolio of mortgage-backed securities even after it stops buying the securities. When it bought the securities, it effectively flooded the financial system with cash. Officials at some point will need to find ways to drain that cash from the financial system. If they move too slowly, it could lead to inflation. If they move too aggressively, it could damage the fragile mortgage market. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has laid out plans that he says will allow him to do it and to raise interest rates as needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit for first-time home buyers, which provides as much as $8,000 for individuals earning up to $75,000 and couples earning up to $150,000, is set to expire in November. It was originally included in the U.S.'s $787 billion stimulus bill passed in February. Congress, increasingly preoccupied with mounting deficits, will have to decide whether to extend it. <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> estimates the credit has helped generate 350,000 sales, about half the increase in single-family-home sales in the past six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit's effectiveness depends largely on its longevity. That is because many of the home sales analysts think it has spurred have been stolen from the future, luring buyers into the market who might not otherwise have bought until next year or beyond. When the credit expires, that demand will disappear, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All it does is move demand forward in time," says Kenneth Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at UC Berkeley. "The last six months, we've seen signs of a housing bottom. We could easily see that disappear."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom McCormick, president of Astoria Homes, a private home builder in Las Vegas, says the government's efforts to prop up the housing market are making a difference, but he says his own business remains very fragile. "The tax credit is what we think got people off the fence," he says. "Once that money came in back in February, the market literally jumped 10% to 20%."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he says, most home buyers are buying existing or foreclosed homes, meaning the new-home market has barely budged. At his peak in 2005, he built more than 1,000 homes. This year, he expects to do fewer than 100. "It is just real dark right now," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet more uncertain is the future of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, an already difficult policy question exacerbated by the passions the pair evoke. When they were placed under government control last year, officials described the move as a "timeout" while they find a permanent solution. Mr. Bernanke has floated the idea of turning them into a public utility or privatizing them and offering government insurance on their bonds for a fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration has put off wrestling with that question. It expects to issue a proposal by March 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't feel like the world is anywhere close to us being able pull back our support," one administration official says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FHA brings its own tough issues. The agency, which insures private lenders against defaults on certain home mortgages, has seen its balance sheet take a hit as risky borrowers default on those loans and is already in danger of falling below a level of reserves mandated by Congress. Yet it remains a key facilitator of loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teri Gifford, who runs a mortgage brokerage serving Kentucky and Ohio, says 95% of her business involves getting clients loans backed by the FHA. "It's all government loans," says Ms. Gifford, whose firm, EZ Mortgage Loans Inc., Hillsboro, Ohio, brokers between $30 million and $35 million in loans each year. "That's all that can be done anymore."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gifford fears that the U.S. will pull back if the loans it is backing start going bad. "I'm worried what the future could hold if we put all the eggs in one basket," she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the great debate continues to rage over tanning machines, one of the amenities many dorms provide. Stand-up machines are out, while beds are back, says Alexander Goldfarb, an analyst with <span class="companylink">Sandler O'Neill &amp; Partners LP</span>.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Campus Apartments, which controls about 24,000 beds in 17 states, says it is making the opposite move, phasing out tanning beds in favor of the stand-up product that costs 50% more to acquire and maintain. Students consider standing up more sanitary and such beds can be twice as fast.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly one year after Seattle was rocked by the largest bank failure in U.S. history, the city has gotten a consolation prize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many office towers are languishing on the market nationwide for lack of credit and buyers, <span class="companylink">Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co</span>. of Milwaukee has stepped up and paid <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. $115 million in cash for most of the largely empty 42-story office complex that once housed the headquarters of <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual Inc</span>., the collapsed Seattle thrift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northwestern also will usher a new employer into the Emerald City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Russell Investments</span>, the investment-management firm known for its widely used stock indexes and a Northwestern subsidiary, will relocate its headquarters from Tacoma, Wash., next year. Russell, a company that Tacoma fought to keep, is expected to occupy about 300,000 square feet in the complex at 1301 Second Ave. It is a short walk from Pike Place Market, a favorite tourist hangout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The former <span class="companylink">WaMu</span> Center building -- designed by NBBJ, which also designed the new Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation headquarters -- will be renamed the <span class="companylink">Russell Investments</span> Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's outstanding for the city of Seattle to have someone who has invested in real estate in such a down market," says Tim Ceis, the city's deputy mayor. "It's a shot in the arm both psychologically as well as financially."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city also has a direct stake in the building's future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Completed in 2006, the <span class="companylink">WaMu</span> tower was built next to the Seattle Art Museum. A spokeswoman for the art museum says it built and expanded its museum space into part of a second, lower tower that is adjacent to the former <span class="companylink">WaMu</span> Center. The museum owns the bottom 12 floors of the tower, of which it previously leased about 240,000 square feet to <span class="companylink">WaMu</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space that had been leased by <span class="companylink">WaMu</span> was financed with about $60 million in city-guaranteed bonds, Mr. Ceis says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>, which acquired the <span class="companylink">WaMu</span> Center building as part of its $1.9 billion acquisition of <span class="companylink">WaMu</span>'s banking operations, didn't try to lease the space because it wanted to sell the building, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the city hopes Northwestern will crank up the marketing program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northwestern appears to have gotten a bargain compared with what the property would have fetched in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At roughly $133 a square foot, Northwestern paid less than half the average price of about $320 a square foot fetched by larger Seattle area office properties near the market peak in 2007, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a New York real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northwestern, with a real-estate equity portfolio valued at about $5.8 billion in June, said the acquisition is one of its first major purchases this year. Tom Zale, managing director of real estate for Northwestern, says the lower cost of buying the asset will give the company some breathing room to beef up the property's bottom line. However, he said the long-term prognosis for the Seattle market is very promising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The short-term outlook, though, isn't that great.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second-quarter vacancies in the city rose to 20.4%, well above the Seattle metrowide average of 17.4%, according to Property &amp; Portfolio Research Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the problem: <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>'s decision late last year to return about 975,000 square feet of leased space to landlords, in <span class="companylink">WaMu</span>'s former headquarters complex and other locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craig Kinzer, president of Kinzer Real Estate Services, which led Russell's site search, said Russell began considering the building last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When James Dimon, chief executive of <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span>, visited Seattle last year, Mr. Ceis recalls asking Mr. Dimon to take the city and museum's interest in the property into consideration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> declined to comment on the meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kinzer says <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> subsequently negotiated with Russell for months without putting the complex officially on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have a city reeling from the loss of <span class="companylink">WaMu</span> and <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> saying, 'What can we do to help you as long as we get a market price?"' Mr. Kinzer says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, Mr. Kinzer says, Northwestern "bought it empty and added value the day it closed."</p>
