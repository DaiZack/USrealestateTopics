</div><div class="author">By WSJ staff </div><div>381 words</div><div>14 February 2021</div><div>15:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. retail sales highlight this week's slate of economic data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MONDAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Japanese economy likely expanded 2.3% from the previous quarter in the October-December period, according to economists surveyed by data provider Quick. Economists say the government's travel incentives and a recovery in exports boosted growth, but they expect the economy to shrink again in the first quarter of 2021 due to a second state of emergency issued in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WEDNESDAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. retail sales fell in each of the final three months of 2020[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/us-economy-december-retail-sales-coronavirus-recovery-11610676272] as Covid-19 cases mounted, governments imposed more restrictions, fiscal support faded and consumers showed more caution. Economists forecast that the January number will show a turnaround, fueled in part by the latest round of stimulus payments and improving data on the virus in the second half of the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. industrial production in January is expected to be up for the fourth straight month, led by another gain in manufacturing output. Factory activity has been a relative bright spot during the pandemic, thanks to solid demand for autos and other durable goods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THURSDAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. jobless claims for the week ended Feb. 13 are expected to continue a downward trend.[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/weekly-jobless-claims-coronavirus-02-11-2021-11612991315] While that is a move in the right direction, the overall level of applications for unemployment benefits is still historically elevated, signaling a high level of layoffs and continuing labor-market dislocation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRIDAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surveys of purchasing managers are expected to indicate that the eurozone economy is sliding into recession, with the key services sector continuing to contract in February as Covid-19 infection rates remain high and government restrictions tight. By contrast, similar surveys are expected to point to a robust recovery in the U.S., as the services sector extends its recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans snapped up single-family homes in 2020 at the fastest pace since the late days of the housing bubble[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-reach-highest-level-in-14-years-11611327933]. While demand is still ample, the supply of homes available for sale is not. Limited inventories and rising prices have led economists to forecast a drop for existing-home sales in January.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying <span class="companylink">Zillow Group</span>'s stock today is like buying a home at the height of the market. Literally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The online real-estate company posted stellar fourth quarter results on Wednesday, showcasing 63% sequential revenue growth of its automated homeflipping business. Meanwhile, revenue for its mortgages segment nearly tripled year-over-year, while its legacy Premier Agent business is still going strong, up 35% on the same basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How much time do you spend on Zillow? Are you actually house-hunting or just browsing? Join the conversation below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow surfing, hardly new, is having a moment thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic. It even became the punchline of a "Saturday Night Live" skit earlier this month, likening it to a 30-year old's adult fantasy. That fantasy appears to have long legs: Zillow is predicting home sales this year will increase 21% with home prices rising double digits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with Zillow's shares up 270% over the last 12 months, including a nearly 18% gain on Thursday following its latest results, a cold shower may be in order. Now 15 years old, Zillow has long been at the forefront of real estate's digital transformation. Its recent moves, including its shift into iBuying[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/ibuying-is-really-about-selling-11592564400] and its acquisition of virtual home touring company ShowingTime, are sure to solidify its position as the future of online real estate. But consumer demand doesn't automatically mean profit, which has very much been a work in progress for Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You wouldn't necessarily know that from reading Zillow's shareholder letters. On Wednesday, Zillow posted quarterly unit economics for its Homes segment, which houses iBuying. That data showed Zillow making nearly $22,000 on average per home it bought and subsequently sold before interest expense. Even after interest expense, Zillow's math shows it made positive returns on homes sold for the first quarter ever[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/opendoor-needs-to-show-its-work-11612524604].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enter Mike DelPrete, a scholar in residence on real-estate technology at the <span class="companylink">University of Colorado at Boulder</span>, who on Thursday published a blog post[https://www.mikedp.com/articles/2021/2/11/ibuyers-turning-obfuscation-of-profit-into-an-art-form] noting iBuyers were "turning obfuscation of profit into an art form." In it, he likens Zillow's unit economics chart to "an immaculate conception version of iBuying, where transactions magically occur without employees, customers materialize out of thin air, and technology is freely available for all."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are further expenses to account for, in other words. Lots of them. Mr. DelPrete's math shows that, after all expenses, Zillow in fact lost $72,000 per home. That would explain why Zillow also said its Homes business lost money, even on the basis of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, in the fourth quarter, while it showed positive returns on a per home basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is that the company is making progress toward profitability. Mr. DelPrete estimates Zillow lost nearly $129,000 in the third quarter per home on the same basis. Yet the majority of the improvement appears to be driven by factors largely beyond Zillow's control. Zillow said operational improvements such as renovations, holding and selling costs accounted for roughly a third of the improvement in returns before interest expense from the third to the fourth quarter. The majority, then, came from factors such as better-than-expected home price appreciation and faster sales velocity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Profit in Zillow's home business increasingly matters to its overall bottom line as the unit expands. As of the fourth quarter, revenue for that business is nearly equal to that of its Premier Agent business, which currently makes up the bulk of its high margin internet, media and technology segment, driving overall profitability for the company today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What, then, will happen if Zillow's economists are overly optimistic about the future state of the U.S. market? <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>'s January forecast shows new and existing home prices growing by an average of less than 8% in 2021 with total home sales rising by less than 4%—well below Zillow's estimates[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/investors-in-online-real-estate-could-get-iced-this-winter-11604664182].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Encouragingly, Zillow reported total visits to its site were up 19% year-over-year in 2020, suggesting there is still a lot of pent-up desire in the real-estate market. The question for investors in 2021 becomes just how much consumers' fantasies will play out in real life.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices are rising at an accelerating pace, new data show, as the strongest housing boom in more than a decade is boosting home values from major metro areas to small cities and vacation spots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price for existing homes in each of more than 180 metro areas tracked by the National Association of Realtors rose in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the association said Thursday. That is the second consecutive quarter that every metro area tracked by <span class="companylink">NAR</span> posted an annual price increase, marking the first time this milestone has been achieved in back-to-back quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest data underscores how the home-price rally, which over the years has played out in distinct pockets has become much more widespread and continues to gain momentum. In the fourth quarter, 161 metro areas posted double-digit-percentage price increases, up from 115 metro areas with double-digit gains in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for homes has surged in the past year as buyers took advantage of record-low interest rates and the pandemic prompted many households to seek bigger houses that could better accommodate remote work.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are willing to move farther out because they only have to go to the office once or twice a week, or month," said Richard Whiteley, co-president and chief operating officer at IHP Capital Partners, which invests in new-home construction and land development. "There's a race for space."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest home-price gainers in the fourth quarter were in the Northeast, led by the area around the seaport city of Bridgeport, Conn., where prices shot up 39.2% from a year earlier. In Pittsfield, Mass., they rose 32.2%, while in the coastal resort town of Atlantic City, N.J., home prices gained 30%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest data underscores how the home-price rally, which over the years has played out in distinct pockets such as Idaho or across parts of the Sun Belt, has become much more widespread and continues to gain momentum.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for homes has surged in the past year as buyers took advantage of record-low interest rates and the pandemic prompted many households to seek bigger houses that could better accommodate remote work.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pandemic also has helped push the supply of homes on the market to record lows[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/housing-market-stays-tight-as-homeowners-stay-put-11611226802], a further boost to prices as potential sellers have been wary of increasing their virus exposure by letting strangers tour their houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest home-price gainers in the fourth quarter were in the Northeast, led by the area around the seaport city of Bridgeport, Conn., where prices shot up 39.2% from a year earlier. In Pittsfield, Mass., they rose 32.2%, while in the coastal resort town of Atlantic City, N.J., home prices gained 30%. Other top performers included popular vacation spots like Naples, Fla., and towns within driving distance of urban centers such as Kingston, in New York's Hudson Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are rising so rapidly they are outweighing the benefit of rock-bottom borrowing rates, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climbing home prices also push up the cost of a down payment, which can be a major obstacle for first-time home buyers, even if monthly mortgage payments are affordable.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Will Parker </div><div>814 words</div><div>5 February 2021</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A11B</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan's condo market is bouncing back after being slammed during the pandemic's early months, with the gains powered by pied-a-terre buyers and those seizing the chance to acquire roomier primary residences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New condominium sales contracts rose 21% in January and December from the same months a year earlier, according to real-estate analytics company UrbanDigs. That marked a broad improvement for the battered condo-sales market in Manhattan, even as its offices remain largely empty and some retailers and restaurants have permanently closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condos and co-ops on the Upper West and Upper East sides recorded the strongest sales activity, UrbanDigs data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate brokers say Manhattan's recent turnabout reflects pent-up demand and tighter suburban inventories, as well as growing buyer confidence that the worst of the pandemic might be behind the city and that its home prices look poised to rise further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think people started to see with the depletion of inventory, with the vaccine around the corner, a renewed positive opinion about the health of the city," said Nikki Field, a broker at Sotheby's International Realty Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers worry about possibly missing out on good deals, she said. "The fear is that we may be looking at the bottom of the market and living there now," she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan has long been home to some of the highest home prices in the country, leading to an average condo sale of about $3 million in 2018. The market hit a rough patch in 2019, but was starting to emerge from it as the pandemic began -- until Covid-19's ensuing impact hurt the Manhattan market more than it has nearly any other major city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When companies based in Manhattan let employees work from home as the city shut down, many workers fled for cheaper cities or more spacious towns and suburbs within driving distance. A net of 70,000 residents left the New York metropolitan area in 2020, according to estimates by location-analytics company Unacast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan sales nosedived 54% during the second quarter, according to a report from real-estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel Inc. and brokerage <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, the biggest quarterly decline in the 30 years the firms have tracked this data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of closed condo sales in Manhattan were down more than 20% in the fourth quarter of last year compared with the previous quarter, and the average unit sold for roughly $2.7 million in the most recent quarter, according to Miller Samuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-operative apartments, which are less expensive because they tend to be older, smaller and carry more restrictive ownership rules than condos, sold for an average price of $1.13 million. But their prices have held up better, slipping only about 7% between the third and fourth quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers say they enjoyed being in control. Shuko Hattori, a mother of two who works in finance, went into contract on a two-bedroom Upper West Side co-op in November. Ms. Hattori said she last purchased a home in Brooklyn in 2016, and found house hunting during the pandemic much more buyer-friendly because there were more properties to choose from in Manhattan than usual and more time to make a decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The last time I looked, things were flying off the market," she said. "Now I feel like the prices are lower. No one is paying over ask. So that's obviously different."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate investors and families purchasing properties for their children have also helped boost sales. That was the case for Joy Wu, a 23-year-old product manager for a medical-supplies company, whose parents bought a new two-bedroom apartment for her at 15 Hudson Yards, the 914-foot-tall skyscraper on Manhattan's West Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and her broker were able to negotiate a discount off the original asking price. "My parents were saying, from an investor perspective, this is just the time to do it," Ms. Wu said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some high-end renters are also taking advantage of discounts to buy for the first time, though the most successful and qualified buyers have tended to be those who already own condos in the city, but are looking to upgrade, said Beth Fisher, senior managing director of new-development marketing firm Corcoran Sunshine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eli Sklar, a mortgage broker with the <span class="companylink">loanDepot</span> lending company, pointed to the dwindling supply of homes for sale in hot corners of Long Island and the Hudson Valley, which swelled with new residents after the pandemic first hit. That inventory shortage has helped draw more buyers who initially set their sights outside the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's kind of turned their heads the other way," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Joseph De Avila </div><div>463 words</div><div>3 February 2021</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A10A</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers purchased the most homes in Connecticut in 15 years in 2020, propelling median-sale prices to a record high, according to a new report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 38,641 single-family home sales in the state in 2020, a 16.6% jump from the prior year, according to the Warren Group, a real-estate research firm. That was the most Connecticut home sales since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median sales prices rose to $300,000 in 2020, a 15.4% increase from the prior year and the highest price on record in the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state's housing market benefited from low-interest rates, growing demand for second homes and the ability of white-collar workers to work remotely amid the pandemic, giving those workers more options to choose where to live, said Timothy Warren, chief executive of the Warren Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the New York City suburbs of Fairfield County, sales volume for single-family homes rose by nearly 27%, and the median sales price hit $540,000, a 22.7% increase from the prior year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connecticut's strong performance surpassed Massachusetts' in terms of growth for both sales volume and median-sale prices, Mr. Warren said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a remarkable turnaround because the real-estate market has been essentially flat since the Great Recession," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong housing market is a welcome change for the state, where median home-sale prices have languished since the collapse of the housing bubble and the ensuing 2007-09 recession. The state's population also has been slowly shrinking since 2014; Connecticut has a population of 3.56 million as of July 2020, according to the U.S. Census.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weak housing market and lack of population growth compounded economic challenges for the state, which still hasn't recovered all the jobs it lost during the last recession. Connecticut also has an unemployment rate of 8%, compared with the national rate of 6.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don Klepper-Smith, chief economist at research firm DataCore Partners, said Connecticut's underlying economic challenges are likely to continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the short term, the state will benefit from the strong demand for Connecticut homes as more people are likely to expedite plans to move to the suburbs as the pandemic continues, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The 2020 numbers were nothing short of stellar," Mr. Klepper-Smith said. "I see another good year for housing" in 2021, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home sales were robust throughout Connecticut in 2020 compared with the prior year. Sales volume was up nearly 30% in Litchfield County, which borders New York state, and nearly 19% in Tolland County, bordering Massachusetts -- two of the more rural regions in the state.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth accelerated in November, as buyers continued to compete for a limited number of residences on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 9.5% in the year that ended in November, up from an 8.4% annual rate the prior month. November marked the highest annual rate of price growth since February 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes, which make up the bulk of the housing market, rose in 2020 to their highest annual level since 2006, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Record-low mortgage rates have increased demand, while the supply of homes for sale has remained low, especially at affordable price points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller 10-city index gained 8.8% over the year ended in November, compared with a 7.6% increase in October. The 20-city index rose 9.1%, after an annual gain of 8% in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market continued to hold stronger than expected throughout the last months of 2020," said Selma Hepp, deputy chief economist at <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>. "Homebuyers will continue to compete for fewer and fewer homes available for sale, which will drive home prices higher."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected the 20-city index to gain 8.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 20-city index measured 19 cities in November due to transaction reporting delays in Wayne County, Mich., according to <span class="companylink">S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices</span>. Price growth accelerated in all of the 19 cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix had the fastest home-price growth in the country for the 18th straight month, at 13.8%, followed by Seattle at 12.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate measure of home-price growth by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> also released Tuesday found an 11% increase in home prices in November from a year earlier.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nicole Friedman </div><div>573 words</div><div>23 January 2021</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales in 2020 surged to their highest level in 14 years, fueled by ultralow interest rates and a pandemic that sent buyers scrambling for more spacious homes to accommodate remote work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robust home sales in the second half of the year surprised many economists while offering a rare bright spot for an economy run aground by closed businesses and mounting job losses during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pandemic-driven job losses were concentrated in lower-paying industries, while households with higher pay and the resources to buy a new home weathered the downturn better. The pandemic prompted many of them to leave big cities for suburbs or smaller towns, while record-low borrowing rates made the decision to trade up easier. Once shelter-in-place restrictions eased, sales took off in June and have rarely flagged since then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's totally because of the pandemic," said Brittany McCreary, who with her husband last month bought their first home, a four-bedroom stone farmhouse, in York, Pa., after leaving the Chicago area. "We're glad we're not renting anymore. We always wanted to buy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose 0.7% in December from November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.76 million, the National Association of Realtors said Friday. The December sales marked a 22% increase from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong house-buying demand is expected to continue this year, economists say, spurring more economic activity like home construction and sales of furniture and home goods. But a shortage of houses for sale is pushing home prices higher, making it costlier for renters trying to enter homeownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales, which make up the bulk of the housing market, totaled 5.64 million in 2020, up 5.6% from 2019 and the highest level since the 2006 pace of 6.48 million, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say today's housing market is less risky than during that boom 14 years ago. Mortgage lending standards are tighter, and the supply of homes on the market is lower relative to demand. Many homeowners facing financial difficulties can also take advantage of current policies allowing them to skip monthly payments and make them up later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market was poised for a strong year in early 2020, as interest rates fell and the large millennial generation continued to age into its prime home-buying years. Home sales then plunged in the spring due to widespread shelter-in-place restrictions, before quickly rebounding in the summer and fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The real important driver has been the record low level of mortgage rates . . . which really enhanced affordability for home buyers," said Frank Nothaft, chief economist at housing-data provider <span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the week ended Thursday, the average rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 2.77%, down from 3.6% a year earlier, said <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While demand has climbed, supply remains tight. Sellers remain wary of listing their homes for sale, partly due to concerns about virus transmission, real-estate agents say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 1.07 million homes for sale at the end of December, down 23% from December 2019, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>. At the current sales pace, there was a 1.9-month supply of homes on the market at the end of December, a record low.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nicole Friedman </div><div>628 words</div><div>22 January 2021</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans are holding on to their homes longer, and it is costing would-be home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The length of time U.S. homeowners stay put has been rising steadily, a big reason why the inventory of homes for sale is at record lows and prices are near highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The typical homeowner in 2020 had remained in place for 13 years, up slightly from 12.8 years in 2019 and well ahead of 2010's reading of 8.7 years, according to a new analysis by real-estate brokerage <span class="companylink">Redfin Corp</span>. About one in four U.S. homeowners has lived in the same home for more than 20 years, the study showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales soared last year, reaching their highest level in 14 years, as the coronavirus pandemic sent many Americans looking for a larger home where they could work remotely more easily. That was one reason why the median length of homeownership leveled off last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But concerns about Covid-19 had the opposite effect among potential sellers. A fear of strangers entering their houses during the pandemic prompted some people to cancel or delay their plans to list their homes, real-estate agents say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those thinking of selling have also been reluctant to act for other reasons, from concerns about finding a new house in a competitive market to ultralow interest rates that make it appealing to refinance and stay put.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners staying in their residences longer is contributing to the worsening shortage of homes on the market. The 1.28 million homes for sale at the end of November was down 22% from November 2019, according to the National Association of Realtors, and inventory sits near its lowest level in decades. At the current sales pace, there was a record-low 2.3-month supply of homes on the market at the end of November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shortage of homes for sale and near-record-low borrowing rates are pushing up prices and stoking competition among buyers. The median existing-home price last year topped $300,000 for the first time. In November, it stood at $310,800, up 15% from a year earlier, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are in a really huge supply crunch," said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist. "It becomes a cycle where people don't want to move because it's so difficult to buy a home, and then that in turn makes it even more difficult to buy a home because people aren't moving and freeing up inventory."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brock and Natalyia Rutherford considered moving in recent years to a more convenient location within their home city of Fort Worth, Texas, but they couldn't find anything they wanted in their price range. They refinanced their mortgage this month and plan to renovate their current house instead of moving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can make this into the house that we want without having to pay more," Mr. Rutherford said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowner tenure rose in 2020 compared with 2019 in most of the country's major metro areas, according to Redfin. In some hot markets, including Charlotte, N.C., and Sacramento, Calif., homeowner tenure fell slightly last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With many baby boomers staying healthier later in life, a large number are preferring to stay in the same home. Dean and Barbara Cotter, who own a six-bedroom house near Salt Lake City, decided last year to refinance instead of downsizing to a retirement community. They have put off their plans to retire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We feel like we want to stay busy," said Mr. Cotter, 74 years old, who works as a real-estate agent. "From a financial standpoint, it doesn't make sense to move."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a year of searching for a home in Oakland, Calif., for their growing family, technology executive Jack Hirsch and his wife Kie Hirsch found the perfect place in November—a charming 1930s Spanish Colonial Revival-style three-bedroom in a family-friendly neighborhood in the city's foothills. But there was one problem: Like many U.S. home buyers in 2020, they had a lot of competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a bid to make their offer stand out in the midst of a three-way bidding war, Ms. Hirsch leveraged her extensive knowledge of rock music.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hirsch was convinced that the sellers were rock music fans, too. During tours of the property, she saw vinyl records by the B-52s, Neil Young and U2, a set of bongo drums, a guitar and a keyboard. They displayed a shadow box filled with old concert tickets. She saw an opening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For their first offer, the Hirsches submitted a bid of $1,450,138 exactly. While it seemed, especially to their mortgage broker, like an oddly specific number, the 138 at the end was a reference to the 1978 song "We Are 138" by the punk rock band Misfits, Ms. Hirsch said. For their second offer, they bid $1,471,979, a reference to the song 1979 by The Smashing Pumpkins. Their final offer of $1,486,753.09, a nod to the 1981 song "867-5309/Jenny" by Tommy Tutone, was accepted. The deal has since closed successfully.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First offer: $1,450,138</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Refers to "We Are 138," the 1978 punk rock song by The Misfits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second offer: $1,471,979</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Invokes the song "1979" by The Smashing Pumpkins</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Final accepted offer: $1,486,753.09</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A nod to the 1981 song "867-5309/Jenny" by Tommy Tutone</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I thought it was a long shot but maybe, just maybe, they would get it," said Ms. Hirsch, 33. She and her husband, 37, were upset they were outbid on a home previously and almost gave up their search. "We were trying to speak to them through the numbers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hirsches, like many American home buyers, felt that they had to get creative to grab sellers' attention. They are not alone. Gone are the days of simply writing a heartfelt letter[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB10001424127887323482504578227703128967098] about how much you love a house, said the Hirsches' agent, Kate Norton of Redfin. Faced with one of the hottest U.S. housing markets in years, buyers today are thinking way outside the box for clever ways to make their offers more appealing, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The price is obviously the most important thing. But if things are close, it can just tip the scales," Ms. Norton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market has rarely been more challenging for buyers. In October, strong demand pushed home sales to a 14-year high[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-home-price-growth-accelerated-in-october-11609250484]. The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which tracks average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the country, rose 8.4% in the year that ended in October, up from a 7% annual rate the prior month. In markets nationwide, properties are getting numerous offers and selling at way above asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's an exhausting and sometimes heartbreaking process," said L.A. marketing executive Andrea Kissling, 40, on her family's search for a home. "There were probably three or four houses that we really wanted and didn't get. My husband, who is a designer, would be already mocking up the space in CAD and then we would find out we didn't get it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have you faced competition buying a home during the pandemic? Join the conversation below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kissling said she and her husband, Brad Kissling, 42, were desperately looking for a bigger home with space for their two young children, son Jack and daughter Lily, and their cat Carson. They toured more than 50 Los Angeles homes. They submitted 16 offers, sometimes over asking, only to be outbid. When they finally found their dream home last summer, a $725,000 three-bedroom house with a big pool in the Northridge area, they knew they had to pull out all the stops. "We were turning up at showings and there would be a line of people who were there before us. These houses were getting 30 or 40 offers and going $100,000 over asking," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Memorabilia around the house indicated that the sellers were fans of the Harry Potter films, so Ms. Kissling got to work putting together a Harry Potter-themed video for the sellers about why they should choose their offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The video opened with the movie franchise's theme music and title cards spelling out "The Kisslings." The Kisslings then proceeded to gush over the home and showed a montage of family photos of them doing Harry Potter-type things, like visiting a Harry Potter attraction and reading Harry Potter books to their children. The company Mr. Kissling works for provided design services for the <span class="companylink">Warner Bros</span>. London studio tour "The Making of Harry Potter," so the couple ended the video by offering to buy the sellers VIP passes to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at <span class="companylink">Universal Studios Hollywood</span> if they accepted the offer. Ms. Kissling, who knows her way around an editing suite thanks to her job in marketing at real-estate firm Nourmand &amp; Associates, said she produced the video in about an hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, the gambit didn't work and the sellers didn't even acknowledge the video. The sellers ultimately chose a bigger offer of $800,000. But Ms. Kissling said the family isn't bitter. "You don't win if you don't play, right?" she said. "If they love it, they love it and if they hate it, they hate it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These tactics are definitely hit-or-miss, said real-estate agent Chris Furstenberg, also of Nourmand &amp; Associates in Los Angeles. Mr. Furstenberg said one of his clients once made an offer that came with the promise of tickets to the Academy Awards; the client was a filmmaker and had once been nominated for a short film, he said. The seller went with another, higher, offer. Mr. Furstenberg said these ploys often only work to break a tie in a bidding war and are rarely the deciding factor for sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They had a chance to rub elbows with the famous movie stars but at the end of the day it boiled down to money," he said. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, sometimes, buyers go too far. Mary Lou Wertz of Maison Real Estate in Charleston, S.C., said she recently represented a couple of young New York doctors relocating to Charleston amid the pandemic. The doctors fell in love online with a $1.2 million modern four-bedroom home in the Mount Pleasant area this fall but, unfortunately for them, the sellers accepted another offer. "They were very disappointed. I'd say more than very," Ms. Wertz said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kisslings said they aren't bitter about losing out on the other house. A Harry Potter book on their coffee table in their new L.A. home, which they purchased later. PHOTO: Natasha Lee for The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a bid to secure the property for themselves, the doctors made an unusual offer: In addition to committing to pay $10,000 more than the other buyers, they offered their competitors $25,000 to walk away from the deal and even told the seller, who had recently lost his wife to cancer, that they would make a $30,000 donation to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Hospital in New York, Ms. Wertz said. The doctors' offer wasn't accepted, Ms. Wertz said. The seller wanted to honor his word to the other buyers and, ultimately, the offer seemed "a little over the top," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Hirsches in Oakland, their funky, music-based offers couldn't have worked better. Their agent said she suspects they got the chance to make a third offer on the property, which is unusual, because the sellers enjoyed their ingenuity. While they closed for exactly $1,486,753, the 9 cents was sadly automatically dropped by the online filing system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Hirsch went to do a quick walk-through of the home post-sale, he said he ran into one of the sellers, who was packing up. "He said, 'I have to ask you. The 138, was that a Misfits reference?'" Mr. Hirsch recalled. It turned out that the seller's uncle was a onetime drummer for the band.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, Mr. Hirsch said, the seller rolled up his sleeve. On his arm, there was a Smashing Pumpkins tattoo.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers are expecting higher levels of inflation over the longer-run, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</span> reports in its December Survey of Consumer Expectations. While expectations for price pressures for a year ahead held steady at a forecast 3% rise, households see 3% inflation in three years, up from 2.8% in the November survey. The report also found expectations for changes in home prices surged last month to 3.6% from 3% in November, reaching the highest reading since July 2018. The bank says that overall, "while perceptions about households' current financial situations compared to a year ago were largely unchanged, one-year ahead expectations about households' financial situations improved slightly with more respondents expecting their financial situation to improve over the next year."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many U.S. billionaires got richer during the pandemic, thanks in part to the recovery of global stock markets. It is perhaps unsurprising then that while individual markets were affected to dramatically different degrees, the ultrahigh end of the real-estate market didn't crash in 2020 as a result of the Covid-19 crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the New York City market took a gut punch as wealthy Manhattanites fled the city, markets such as the Hamptons, Greenwich, Conn., Palm Beach and Los Angeles boomed. Local agents attributed that uptick in part to the increasing fortunes of the wealthiest Americans, a desire by the rich to get out of densely populated environments and a rise in the number of people who wanted to upsize to larger homes with space for work-from-home friendly amenities like offices and gyms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the third quarter, sales of Manhattan luxury homes -- defined as the top 10% of transactions -- were down by 46.7% compared with the same period in 2019, according to a report by <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>. In contrast, sales of luxury homes in Palm Beach and high-end single-family homes in Los Angeles were up by 87.5% and 33.5%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's the strongest luxury market in the history of Palm Beach, record prices in every single category," said Danny Hertzberg, a luxury agent with Coldwell Banker Realty in South Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Read on for a closer look at the biggest deals of 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. THE WARNER ESTATE IN LOS ANGELES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$165 MILLION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many ways, Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos has been a key figure during the pandemic, as his company's stock price skyrocketed amid increased demand for online shopping. In April, he closed on a deal to buy the Warner Estate, the glamorous 1930s-era mansion designed for the late Warner Bros. president Jack Warner, from David Geffen for $165 million, setting a price record for a Los Angeles home. It was a direct, off-market deal with no agents involved, The Wall Street Journal reported. Neither Mr. Bezos nor Mr. Geffen commented on the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sitting on 9 acres, the property has its own 9-hole golf course, several guest houses, a tennis court and gardens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. JEFFREY KATZENBERG ESTATE IN BEVERLY HILLS, CALIF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$125 MILLION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, entertainment executive Jeffrey Katzenberg sold his Beverly Hills home for $125 million in an off-market deal to Jan Koum, one of the founders of the messaging service WhatsApp, according to people familiar with the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, a spokesman for Mr. Katzenberg said the sale was a move to downsize, and that the buyer had submitted an offer that Mr. Katzenberg and his wife Marilyn Katzenberg couldn't refuse. They had bought the site of the property for $35 million in 2009, records show. Mr. Koum couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property records show the home spans is 26,000 square feet, and sits on almost 7 acres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. 220 CENTRAL PARK SOUTH #PH76 IN NEW YORK, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$99.9 MILLION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A $99.9 million deal for a penthouse at 220 Central Park South, the new limestone tower designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects on Billionaires' Row, closed in July, more than three years after the contract was initially signed. Together with a smaller unit on a lower floor, which is designated in offering plans as a guest or staff space, the total price came to close to $102 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. OWLWOOD ESTATE IN LOS ANGELES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$88 MILLION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Los Angeles estate once owned actor by Tony Curtis -- and later by pop duo Sonny &amp; Cher -- sold for $88 million in December, according to property records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller was the Viewpoint Collection, an entity formed to sell assets that were formerly controlled by the Woodbridge Group of Companies and its former owner Robert Shapiro. A Viewpoint spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shapiro was recently identified by federal prosecutors as the mastermind of a $1.3 billion investment fraud that snared thousands of people across the country, The Wall Street Journal reported. Prosecutors said Woodbridge bought mansions, including the Owlwood estate, with cash from investors who thought they were investing on loans on properties, not buying them outright. Mr. Shapiro was sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2019, and a chunk of the properties have since been sold off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Owlwood buyer is identified in records as Calch Urban Residential, a limited-liability company with a primary address in Homewood, Ill. A person listed on the deed as a representative for the company, Robert Jacobson of the Chicago accountancy firm Friedman + Huey, said the buyer was a developer who had partnered with private investors on the purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. HAMPTONS COMPOUND IN SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$84 MILLION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, billionaire hedge-fund manager Ken Griffin closed on an $84 million deal to buy a modern Hamptons estate from designer Calvin Klein, according to public records and people familiar with the deal. The property was the latest in a long line of trophy properties snapped up by Mr. Griffin across the country in recent years. Neither Mr. Griffin nor Mr. Klein commented on the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. TROUSDALE ESTATES DUO IN LOS ANGELES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$75.5 MILLION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A limited-liability company tied to the family of Taiwanese billionaire Terry Gou, founder of iPhone assembler <span class="companylink">Foxconn Technology Group</span>, paid $75.5 million for two neighboring homes in the pricey Trousdale Estates area of Los Angeles in January, according to people familiar with the deal. Neither Mr. Gou nor the developers could be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7. WATERFRONT FLORIDA ESTATE IN PALM BEACH, FLA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$71.85 MILLION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financier and energy entrepreneur Robb E. Turner and his wife Lydia Turner sold their more than 2-acre lakefront estate for $71.85 million in June, property records show. Mr. Turner couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8. KENNEDY WINTER WHITE HOUSE IN PALM BEACH, FLA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$70 MILLION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Palm Beach mansion formerly owned by the Kennedy family and used by President John F. Kennedy as a winter retreat, sold for $70 million in June to a real-estate developer, who filed plans to upgrade it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller was New York real-estate billionaire Jane Goldman, who bought the property in 2015 for $31 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9. THE FOOTHILL ESTATE IN BEVERLY HILLS, CALIF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$68 MILLION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entertainment and sports executive Casey Wasserman, grandson of the late Hollywood mega-agent Lew Wasserman, sold his newly completed home for $68 million in June, far less than its original $125 million asking price. The buyer was David Geffen, according to a person familiar with the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither Mr. Wasserman nor Mr. Geffen responded to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10. HAMPTONS COMPOUND IN EAST HAMPTON, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$67 MILLION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 3.4-acre East Hampton estate with a roughly 8,000-square-foot oceanfront mansion designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects with a waterfront pool sold for $67 million in October, according to a person familiar with the deal. The estate also includes a 6,000-square-foot guesthouse that has its own pool. The houses were formerly owned by the late former <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> executive Charles G. Phillips and his wife Candace Phillips records show.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday: The health of the manufacturing sector will be in focus with the release of purchasing-managers index data from China, the eurozone, U.K. and U.S. Economists expect U.S. construction spending rose 1.1% in November, according to a Wall Street Journal poll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday: A report on the manufacturing sector from the <span class="companylink">Institute for Supply Management</span> is expected to show it continued to expand in December, albeit at a slower pace than in November.</p>

The ISM's gauge of services-sector activity will likely show it fell slightly but remained in growth territory in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday: The December jobs report is expected to show the labor market ended the year on a weak footing, with employers adding 68,000 jobs and the unemployment rate ticking up to 6.8%.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth accelerated in October, as strong demand pushed home sales to a 14-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 8.4% in the year that ended in October, up from a 7% annual rate the prior month. October marked the highest annual rate of price growth since March 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes, which make up the bulk of the housing market, rose in October to the highest level since 2006[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/home-sales-rise-to-14-year-high-in-october-11605798326], according to the National Association of Realtors. Record-low mortgage rates have increased demand, while the supply of homes for sale has remained low, especially at affordable price points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller 10-city index gained 7.5% over the year ended in October, compared with a 6.2% increase in September. The 20-city index rose 7.9%, after an annual gain of 6.6% in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The data from the last several months are consistent with the view that Covid has encouraged potential buyers to move from urban apartments to suburban homes," said Craig Lazzara, managing director and global head of index investment strategy at <span class="companylink">S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices</span>, in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected the 20-city index to gain 6.9%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate investment has outstripped GDP growth for the most of the last two decades, excluding brief periods of financial stress in 2008-09, 2015-16 and the first quarter of 2020, figures from <span class="companylink">China's National Bureau of Statistics</span> show. With negligible foreign investment, that means debt has mounted both at developers and the families buying the properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The history</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As recently as 1978, virtually no housing was privately owned in China. Creeping experimental reforms led to the beginning of wholesale privatization of the public housing stock in 1988. In the early and mid-1990s, the real-estate giants of today—and their future billionaire owners—were just coming into existence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December 1987, Shenzhen held its first auction of land use rights, a practice mimicking the sales conducted a few miles south in Hong Kong, still under British control at the time. The model would eventually be adopted by municipalities across the country and become a major source of funding for cash-strapped local governments[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/bills-come-due-for-chinas-local-governments-11577467587].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Land sales and taxes on developers now make up a large share[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chinese-real-estate-has-eaten-the-asian-junk-bond-market-11557217364] of local government revenue[https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27697/w27697.pdf], providing an overwhelming incentive[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-delicate-task-of-dealing-with-chinas-most-debt-burdened-property-giants-11598959634] for local and regional party elites to keep the show on the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate industry now accounts for about 7% of Chinese GDP, having climbed steadily upward from around 4% or below at the time of the big bang privatizations of the 1990s, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The players</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's large banks, once primarily financiers of industry, are increasingly devoted to the mortgage industry[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chinese-banks-will-rise-or-fall-with-the-property-market-11551346196]. Real estate-related lending now makes up 37.5% of <span class="companylink">Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China</span>'s book, from below 30% as recently as 2014, and below 20% in 2004, according to <span class="companylink">S&amp;P Capital IQ</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large developers such as China Evergrande, <span class="companylink">Country Garden Holdings</span> and <span class="companylink">China Vanke</span> have loaded up on debt to different degrees, but the sector is heavily leveraged across the board. Taking on debt allows the companies to bid aggressively in land auctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sector has become a major chunk of the global dollar debt market, even though it has almost no dollar-denominated income. Not much less than half of the <span class="companylink">ICE</span> Asian dollar high yield index is now made up of Chinese developers' debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following the global financial crisis of 2008-09, Beijing's stimulus sent credit surging, with much investment finding its way into residential real estate. During the following years, China's "ghost cities"[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chinas-ghost-towns-haunt-its-economy-1529076819] became internationally famous: districts and sometimes entire towns in which residents had never arrived, leaving developers burdened with enormous inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, real-estate firms have learned their lesson, but new vulnerabilities have emerged. The already-common practice of selling units that haven't yet been completed[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chinese-property-giants-could-regret-milking-the-countrys-middle-class-11568875710], and in some cases where construction has barely begun, now makes up about 90% of residential housing sales, according to the statistics bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Combined, self-raised funds—the category that includes bond market proceeds—and deposit and mortgage payments from home buyers make up about two-thirds of the companies' funding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And though developers have learned their lesson when it comes to building properties that won't be purchased, the vacancy rate[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/china-property-real-estate-boom-covid-pandemic-bubble-11594908517] of urban Chinese housing—at over 20%, according to the China Household Finance Survey—still exceeds that of some vacation hot spots in southern Europe, where second homes are common.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The households</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dealing with overburdened real-estate developers is tough for the central government, but middle-class Chinese families who have borrowed large sums to invest in property are a far more sensitive issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese household debt sat below 20% of GDP until 2009, but has climbed aggressively since. Despite rapid economic growth, the metric stood at 59.1% as of June 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> forecast in 2019—before this year's surge in household debt—that the climb would continue, reaching about 68% by 2024. Chinese households are now far more heavily leveraged[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chinas-floundering-crackdown-on-household-debt-11565958922] than other East Asian economies at a similar stage of development, and debt is largely concentrated in real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The burden of household debt in China is even heavier than that statistic would suggest, since household income is a smaller fraction of China's economy than it is in the Western world. Research firm Rhodium Group suggests the household debt to income ratio sits at an eye-watering 128%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks in China are seen as an unreliable, speculative market. Private workplace pensions still aren't widespread, households can't easily invest abroad, and ironically for an ostensibly communist country, social-security programs offer little protection. All of this channels more money into property: Residential housing comprises about three-quarters of Chinese household wealth, explaining its pivotal role in the country's economic policy, and why Beijing is reluctant to allow prices to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much recent lending and purchasing has been done by families who already own at least one property, with additional apartments regularly left empty. Some will be passed onto the next generation, but China's awkward demographics mean the population will soon begin to shrink, worsening the equation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The future</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Optimists note the risks associated with Chinese real estate have been a perennial subject of doom-laden warnings for a decade and more: China is more prosperous than it was a decade ago, and blowups have been rare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But repeated efforts by the central government to restrain the industry have floundered, with the incentives of households, developers and local bureaucrats all aligned to keeping the show on the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As time goes on, the risks aren't just of losses and defaults, but waste: Plowing large proportions of the country's income into an asset market with no yield has consequences for prosperity and productivity.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the pandemic shut down the economy this spring, <span class="companylink">Walmart Inc</span>. all but closed the department where Christina Rogers works as an optician. Her children's schools closed, too. She thought she might have to dip into savings as they hunkered down in St. George, Utah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, her financial situation improved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though her earnings dropped when she cut back hours to look after her children, company bonuses[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/walmart-to-pay-550-million-in-staff-bonuses-hire-150-000-temporary-workers-11584664622] and a federal stimulus check put extra money in her pocket. She bought stocks right before the market roared back this spring and refinanced her mortgage as interest rates plummeted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coronavirus crisis has unfolded in ways few could have expected. Bankers, consumer advocates and, yes, journalists, assumed that when the economy fell apart in March, Americans' finances would, too. Many recalled how the last financial crisis knocked millions of people off their feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This crisis is nothing like the last one. But, with the benefit of hindsight, it is becoming clear just how much the 2007-09 recession shaped the coronavirus recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, the government response led to a slow recovery that required years to take hold. This time, faced with a bigger and quicker economic shock, the government response rolled out in weeks—handing more people bigger unemployment benefits and one-time stimulus checks. In many cases, recipients made more money with the benefits[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/coronavirus-relief-often-pays-workers-more-than-work-11588066200] than they did at their regular jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far Americans have, on average, managed quite well. They paid down credit-card debt[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/consumers-flush-with-stimulus-money-shun-credit-card-debt-11596373201] and saved more[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/americans-are-saving-more-but-how-long-can-it-last-11591272180]. Their household net worth jumped to record highs[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-household-net-worth-rose-to-a-record-in-third-quarter-fed-says-11607619837], aided by the stock surge. Their credit scores went up[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/coronavirus-tanked-the-economy-then-credit-scores-went-up-11603013402].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet those encouraging statistics mask an increasingly unequal economy. Millions of Americans are out of work and facing permanent job losses. More people are going hungry[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/more-americans-go-hungry-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-census-shows-11597570200]. Hundreds of thousands of small-business owners have closed shop[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/covid-19-shuttered-more-than-1-million-small-businesses-here-is-how-five-survived-11596254424].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The averages are certainly true but there are a lot of folks who are more vulnerable," said Ray Kluender, a professor at Harvard Business School who studies household financial distress. "They have certainly been trending in the wrong direction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last crisis—and the lessons learned from it—set the stage for the response to this one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When financial markets went haywire in March, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> unleashed a series of monetary stimulus measures inspired by the earlier crisis—but magnitudes larger and faster. Those programs kept large companies solvent and added a helping hand in the stock market's return to record highs[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-s-p-500-sets-first-record-since-february-erasing-its-coronavirus-plunge-11597781130].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bailouts and stimulus of the last crisis primed the pump for Congress to act quickly when the pandemic hit. Then, the aid was targeted at businesses—namely, banks and auto makers—that were nearing collapse. Help for consumers largely came through payroll tax cuts, expanded unemployment and food stamps.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* For Many Big Businesses, 2020 Was a Surprisingly Good Year[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/for-many-big-businesses-2020-was-a-surprisingly-good-year-11608310791]

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, lawmakers rushed to get money to nearly every American and a wider swath of business. The government cut checks, expanded unemployment benefits further and wrote forgivable loans to small businesses. The $2 trillion stimulus package in March propped up the economy when businesses and consumers couldn't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government also offered homeowners generous mortgage forbearance—up to a year of paused payments—enabled because it backs most home loans made in recent years. That allowed it to head off a 2008-style housing bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks and other financial institutions were the villains of the last crisis, accused of inflating the housing bubble. This time around, they were eager to look like the good guys. They rolled out plans to help borrowers pause debt payments and waived fees and other charges for a time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were in a better position to offer those benefits. Stiff regulations imposed after the financial crisis pushed them to curtail risk and build up robust reserves of capital to deploy when an emergency hit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many consumers also changed. Burned a dozen years ago by the bubble in the residential property market, they now managed their money more prudently. The average credit score had been steadily increasing and continued to rise as the recession took hold, according to <span class="companylink">Fair Isaac Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around 2008, Ms. Rogers, the <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> employee, was getting out of a marriage that had left her and her ex-husband in debt. She grew up poor and sometimes used a neighbor's house to shower, she said. Saving money wasn't a focus. "I was in a financial crisis my entire life," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the divorce, she prioritized paying down her credit-card debt and building up her savings. By 2010, she had put enough aside for a down payment on a house, where she lives with her partner and children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Years of financial restraint left her in a strong position come March. The <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> optical department where she works effectively closed temporarily, but she transferred to the pharmacy. When stocks nosedived, she opened investment accounts for her children. She refinanced her mortgage in late spring, getting a 20-year loan with an interest rate of just over 3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financially, the crisis "didn't affect me too much, except being able to take advantage of things," Ms. Rogers said. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank executives have spotted shifts in customer saving and spending habits in checking- and savings-account data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the last crisis, people used stimulus checks and tax breaks to make big purchases like TV sets and cars. But when this crisis hit, many were more measured. For those who did increase spending, it was often for everyday items like food and home improvement. It helped that Americans had fewer places to spend. Eat-in restaurants and entertainment venues shut down. Traveling was off the table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How has your financial situation changed in 2020? Join the conversation below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People took more responsibility to use the money for what it was intended—let me reduce risk, pay down debt," said Mary Mack, who runs <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span>.'s consumer bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was one of Joe Ormiston's first moves. He lost his job as a bartender when the Nashville, Tenn., sushi restaurant where he worked closed in March, then shut permanently. Expanded unemployment benefits, plus a stimulus check, pretty much replaced his income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the government benefits came through, he stopped using his credit card and paid off his $600 balance. He didn't want the debt hanging over him during an uncertain time, he said. "Not having a job, not knowing what's going on, at least it's something I can control," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Families who lost jobs but received government benefits fared pretty well for the first few months of the recession, according to a <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. Institute analysis of the bank's account and credit-card data[https://www.jpmorganchase.com/institute/research/household-income-spending/household-cash-balances-during-covid-19-a-distributional-perspective]. At first, bank-account balances swelled, but the median household spent down much of those funds as the pandemic dragged on and expanded unemployment benefits lapsed over the summer. The lower their income in 2019, the more their balances dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Mr. Ormiston's expanded benefits expired, his weekly unemployment check dropped to about $250 a week. It recently stopped altogether. He has spent about a quarter of the $20,000 he was saving for a down payment on a home and is using his credit cards again. Finding it difficult to get a new job, he enlisted in the Navy Reserve. Boot camp starts early next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While consumer purchases have picked up in recent months, localized spending patterns haven't returned to normal. One example: Spending dropped the most in the wealthiest neighborhoods as white-collar workers sequestered at home, according to John Friedman, an economist at Brown University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Brett Apparel, a men's clothing store in Fox Point, Wis., has felt the shift. Normally, a steady stream of Milwaukee-area executives and financiers would come in for custom suits, trousers and sport coats. Even during the financial crisis, people still needed to dress up. But since March, the calendar has been mostly empty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a completely different thing in terms of just how severe and absolute it was," said Bob Richards, the store's owner and sole employee. "Can you spend money on something you don't really need and definitely aren't going to use for a while?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Richards got a Paycheck Protection Program loan and a state grant. But he had to close his storefront; he will continue through direct sales. His family of five has dug into savings and his retirement account. They got a forbearance on their mortgage and are stretching their groceries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't clear where Americans' finances are headed. Congress has recently passed and President Trump on Sunday night signed another stimulus package[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/trump-signs-covid-19-aid-bill-averting-government-shutdown-11609117841] that gives people on unemployment an extra $300 a week. Many also will receive $600 stimulus checks, and moratoriums on evictions will be extended through the end of January. The small-business loan program will reopen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If unemployment remains elevated longer than the stimulus is in effect, the economy's dividing lines could deepen, said Peter Ganong, a professor of public policy at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We might end up in an unforced error in a way that is similar to the Great Recession," Mr. Ganong said. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Nicole Friedman </div><div>821 words</div><div>25 December 2020</div><div>09:03</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid the biggest housing boom in years, home builders are worried they are running out of land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combination of record low interest rates and a new premium on space during the pandemic has generated robust home sales. A shortage of previously owned homes[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-home-sales-decline-in-november-after-five-monthly-gains-11608650319] on the market is prompting more buyers to opt for new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acquiring and preparing land for new-home construction can be a lengthy process. Builders often buy land at least a year before building on it, and they sometimes spend years obtaining permits, installing sewage systems or paving roads before they prepare lots for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with much of their land inventory still in the development process, builders face the prospect of a shortage next year of finished lots, or land that is ready to build, according to Jody Kahn, senior vice president at John Burns Real Estate Consulting LLC, which regularly surveys builders and land brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can't just pour more beans in the top of the funnel and produce more coffee," said Phillippe Lord, chief operating officer at Scottsdale, Ariz.-based builder Meritage Homes Corp. "The competition for land is extremely high as the homebuying demand grows," said Mr. Lord, who becomes chief executive on Jan. 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scarcity of developed land means that builders could be unable to meet booming demand[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/demand-for-houses-boosts-home-construction-11598961600]. It also means builders would be able to keep raising prices, analysts say. New-home sales rose 19.1% by volume in the first 11 months of 2020 compared with the same period last year, according to the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luke Pickerill, owner of MonteVista Homes in Bend, Ore., worries he will miss some of the buying frenzy. His company is selling 16 to 20 homes a month, up from its typical pace of eight to 10 homes a month. He has projects in development, but they won't be ready for a few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In Central Oregon, I will literally be out of lots and I'll have nothing to sell" by next month, said Mr. Pickerill. "All of the inventory that we expected to be selling in quarter one and quarter two of next year, we've now sold through it already this year," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition is stiff for lots that are ready to build on, said Greg Vogel, chief executive of Land Advisors Organization, a land brokerage based in Scottsdale. "In many markets…we just can't deliver enough finished lot inventory to satisfy the demand," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders' rush to buy land underscores their confidence in the market's continued strength. A measure of U.S. home-builder confidence rose in November to a high in data going back to 1985, before declining slightly this month, the National <span class="companylink">Association of Home Builders</span> said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Land values can be volatile, and many builders found themselves burdened with large land holdings after the 2008-09 financial crisis, including in exurban locations far from city centers. This time they are hedging their risk in remote locations by buying smaller sites, Ms. Kahn said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index that tracks the availability of finished lots fell 9% in the third quarter from a year earlier to a low in data going back to 2015, according to Zonda, a housing-market research firm. The most significantly undersupplied markets in the third quarter included San Diego, Seattle, Nashville, Tenn., Boise, Idaho, and Las Vegas, according to Zonda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for finished lots rose 11% in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to research and advisory firm Zelman &amp; Associates.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have you bought a newly built home during the pandemic? Share your experience below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many builders paused or slowed land purchases[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/home-builders-still-hammering-away-but-fear-a-slowdown-looms-11584652300] when the pandemic caused a shutdown of economic activity in the U.S. in March, amid concerns about a decline in housing demand. That has worsened the shortage they are facing now, said Mr. Lord of Meritage Homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pandemic ended up boosting homebuying demand, as shoppers sought out houses better suited to working or schooling from home. Changes in remote-work policies also prompted some workers to relocate to cheaper areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Land projects currently in development are also moving slower than usual as local governments adjust to remote work, Mr. Lord said. <span class="companylink">Meritage</span> said it spent almost $300 million on land and development in the third quarter, a high for the builder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some builders are responding to the demand by limiting sales to ensure they don't sell more homes than they can construct at one time.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes sales slipped in November as the supply of properties for sale fell to a new low, the latest sign strong economic momentum in the middle of the year is easing in 2020's final months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales in November fell 2.5% from October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.69 million -- the first decline in six months, the National Association of Realtors said. November sales of previously owned homes, which make up most of the market, rose 25.8% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Without a doubt, there are too many buyers in relation to the sellers," said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. "That is probably the main driver as to why the sales declined."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, U.S. consumers' outlook on the economy darkened in December as coronavirus cases climbed nationwide, the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>, a private research group, said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And economic growth in the summer months was revised slightly higher to a 33.4% annual pace, the Commerce Department said. The gain came after the economy contracted during the first half of the year. Economists project a slower pace of growth in the final three months of 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Record-low interest rates have boosted home-buying demand in recent months. Existing-home sales rose for five straight months through October to the highest seasonally adjusted annual rate since 2006. Fears of virus transmission have made people wary of putting their homes up for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes on the market at the end of November was the lowest on record going back to 1982. A widespread shortage of homes for sale has pushed prices higher. The median existing-home price rose 14.6% from a year earlier to $310,800, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy has shown signs of cooling. Initial claims for jobless benefits, a proxy for layoffs, rose in early December to the highest level since September. Private-sector data indicated the number of job openings slipped in this month. And retail sales fell in November for the second straight month. The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said its consumer-confidence index fell to 88.6 in the first two weeks of December, from a revised 92.9 in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumers' assessment of current conditions deteriorated sharply in December, as the resurgence of Covid-19 remains a drag on confidence," said Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board. "It appears that growth has weakened further in [the fourth quarter], and consumers do not foresee the economy gaining any significant momentum in early 2021."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes sales slipped in November as the supply of properties for sale fell to a new low, the latest sign strong economic momentum in the middle of the year is easing in 2020's final months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales fell 2.5% in November from October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.69 million, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, economic growth during the summer months was revised slightly higher[https://www-bea-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product] to a 33.4% annual pace, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Record-low interest rates have boosted homebuying demand[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/home-prices-are-rising-everywhere-in-the-u-s-11605220823] in recent months. Existing-home sales rose for five straight months through October to the highest seasonally adjusted annual rate since 2006. At the same time, fears of virus transmission have made potential sellers wary of putting their homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes on the market at the end of November was the lowest level on record going back to 1982. A widespread shortage of homes for sale[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-home-price-growth-accelerated-in-september-11606227049] has prompted competition among buyers and pushed prices higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median existing-home price rose 14.6% from a year earlier to $310,800, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices are making it difficult for first-time buyers to enter the market, real-estate agents say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Tacoma, Wash., almost every property is getting multiple offers, and first-time buyers are having to raise their budgets or look farther out of town to find homes they can afford, said Redfin Corp. agent Amber Allin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median existing-home price in Pierce County, where Tacoma is located, rose 16.9% in November from a year earlier, according to the Northwest Multiple Listing Service. "It is pushing a lot of buyers beyond where they would naturally be comfortable," Ms. Allin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carly and Andy Gerstlauer lost out on multiple houses before buying a three-bedroom home in Beaverton, Ore., in November. Their mortgage didn't require a down payment, which made their home purchase more affordable but made them less competitive against other buyers, Ms. Gerstlauer said. "We were just getting so frustrated," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 1.28 million homes for sale at the end of November, down 9.9% from October and down 22% from November 2019, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>. At the current sales pace, there was a 2.3-month supply of homes on the market at the end of November, a record low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, so the November figures largely reflect purchase decisions made in October or September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In more recent weeks, the economy has shown signs of cooling. Initial claims for jobless benefits, a proxy for layoffs, increased in early December[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/weekly-jobless-claims-coronavirus-12-17-2020-11608169231] to the highest level since September.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said its index of consumer confidence dropped to 88.6 in the first two weeks of December, from a revised 92.9 in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumers' assessment of current conditions deteriorated sharply in December, as the resurgence of Covid-19 remains a drag on confidence," said Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board. "It appears that growth has weakened further in [the fourth quarter], and consumers do not foresee the economy gaining any significant momentum in early 2021."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More broadly the economic recovery this year has shown a divergence. Lower-wage workers, especially at restaurants, hotels and malls, have been more likely to lose their jobs. But wealthier Americans, who more frequently can work remotely, have benefited from rising home prices and a surging stock market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">NAR</span> report showed home sales were especially strong at the high end of the market, with sales of homes priced at more than $1 million up 88% in November compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for primary and second homes in Palm Beach, Fla., has surged due to the pandemic, said Blair Kirwan of Brown Harris Stevens. "We are seeing huge numbers of people that are coming down, looking at four or five houses in a weekend, and making a decision right then and there," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales declined month-over-month in the Midwest, South and Northeast, and they were unchanged in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales have also climbed in recent months. A measure of U.S. home-builder confidence slipped in December after hitting a record high in November in data going back to 1985, the National <span class="companylink">Association of Home Builders</span> said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts, a measure of U.S. home-building, rose 1.2% in November from October, the Commerce Department said Thursday.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Telis Demos </div><div>579 words</div><div>17 December 2020</div><div>06:30</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transition period away from the universal but tarnished funding benchmark, the London interbank offered rate, in the U.S. has gotten a bit longer for some loans[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-regulators-press-banks-to-transition-from-libor-for-new-transactions-11606745216]. That will be mostly welcome news for many investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The typical investor's exposure to the risks of a transition to a new benchmark aren't terribly direct. Credit cards are typically floating-rate, but are often linked to the prime rate, not Libor—although the cost of funding for some card loans may be via securitizations priced in Libor terms. A subset of investors may own preferred shares, like those issued by banks, whose payouts are tied to Libor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a more common exposure is via mortgages. Over $1 trillion worth of residential mortgages are estimated to have adjustable rates linked to Libor. Funding for mortgage loans historically also is often Libor-based, via warehouse lines from banks, the securitization market or Federal Home Loan Bank advances. In addition to being home borrowers, many investors are now also betting on the mortgage business itself via stocks like rapidly growing and highly valued originator <span class="companylink">Rocket Cos</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For mortgages, a delay in the end of Libor might come at just the right time. U.S. regulators in November backed a proposal that while new debt still shouldn't be linked to Libor beyond 2021, many existing debts can continue to reference it for another 18 months, through June 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means the transition period for many loans may be put off to a time when rates are less extraordinarily low, which could be a good thing. Right now there is relatively little demand for certain floating-rate mortgages or funding, which some analysts say has slowed the market's evolution toward a new benchmark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At historically low fixed rates, many existing homeowners are refinancing adjustable-rate mortgages into fixed ones, and many new buyers also are getting very favorable 30-year fixed rates. Adjustable-rate mortgages as a percentage of the number of weekly mortgages applications have dropped to below 2%, levels not seen since early 2009, according to <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, banks have plentiful deposits right now and nonbank originators are flush with cash, reducing reliance on other forms of funding, particularly those at a floating rate. Analyst Joseph Abate at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> in a recent note highlighted a related drop in demand for advances from Federal Home Loan Banks used to fund mortgage lending, depressing the use of advances linked to the new benchmark[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-s-williams-sofrratesystem-has-performed-well-during-coronavirus-crisis-11594655100?mod=article_inline], the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should the system become less flush with cash next year as conditions normalize, <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> analysts forecast that FHLB advances linked to SOFR could jump from less than $10 billion to $100 billion by the end of next year. That would help with the further development of the broader SOFR market, <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> argued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage lenders and servicers will still have to learn whether the move to new benchmarks will affect borrower demand or cause complaints. But testing a new system now, while demand for many floating-rate loans is low, and then allowing more of the transition to play out in a different rate environment should promote a smoother transition.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surging home prices that have been one of the surprise developments in the coronavirus pandemic are unlikely to continue to move higher, says a new report from research firm Capital Economics. "With pent-up demand from the spring now largely expended, mortgage interest rates unlikely to fall further, inventory at record lows and early signs that the exodus from cities is slowing, home sales will edge back further over 2021," the firm says. "That, alongside tight credit conditions, suggest the current boom in house prices will prove short-lived," the report says. It also noted rental demand is again picking up. (Michael S. Derby)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>.'s sales rose in the latest quarter, fueled by low borrowing costs and shifting living preferences driven by the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The luxury home builder said it generated $2.55 billion in sales, a 7% increase from a year ago and ahead of analysts' projections of $2.08 billion, according to FactSet. Revenue from home sales, which represents a majority of the company's total revenue, rose about 9% to $2.5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are currently experiencing the strongest housing market I have seen in my 30 years at <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>, and we continue to increase prices in nearly all of our communities," Chief Executive Douglas Yearley said in prepared remarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of contracts for new homes increased 68% to 3,407 units from last year, while contract value rose 63% to $2.74 billion in the quarter ended Oct. 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market has gotten a boost from pandemic trends as many have left large cities in search of bigger homes in less crowded areas where they can work remotely and enjoy more space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll's home-building deliveries rose 10% to 2,940 from the year-earlier period. The company expects around 1,675 home deliveries in the first quarter with an average price between $780,000 and $800,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll said that in the first six weeks of the current quarter, demand has remained very strong compared with one year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said nonbinding reservation deposits, which are a precursor to contracts, have risen 48%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers have been aided by mortgage rates that reached another record low last Thursday, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. The low supply of homes for sale is boosting housing prices as well as demand for newly built housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to low rates, Mr. Yearley said, companies allowing their employees to work from home has allowed more buyers to live where they want.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of Toll, which are up nearly 25% in 2020, slid 3.8% to $47.32 in after-hours trading Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the country, rose 7% year-over-year in September, representing the highest annual growth rate since May 2014. The index has a two-month lag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes, which make up the bulk of the housing market, rose 4.3% in October from September to a 14-year high, extending a five-month streak of consecutive increases and marking one of the best stretches for the housing market in several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the quarter, Toll recorded a profit of $199.3 million, or $1.55 a share, compared with $202.3 million, or $1.41 a share, in the comparable period a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected $1.24 in per-share earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home builder expects fiscal 2021 home deliveries of between 9,600 and 10,200 homes and an average price in the range of $790,00 and $810,000.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Mike Bird </div><div>430 words</div><div>28 November 2020</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This October, U.S. housing sales hit their highest level since 2006. China's residential real-estate investment was up 14% relative to the same month last year. Around the world, many housing markets have shrugged off a colossal economic slump, helped by low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the short term, such investment is a boost to economic activity in a year where headline figures have collapsed. But there are significant downsides. The fact that housing booms can be a longer-term risk to financial stability is well known, but a growing body of research suggests that even where there is no market blowup, surges in prices and investment can have a deleterious impact on productivity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New evidence comes from the <span class="companylink">Bank for International Settlements</span>, with a paper by economist Sebastian Doerr showing that among U.S.-listed companies, those with a higher share of real-estate assets are persistently less productive than their industry peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That alone wouldn't be a problem as such. Some companies are always more productive than others. But rising real-estate prices make it easier for companies that own real estate to access funding because of their growing collateral, so multiyear booms in property prices compound the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking at data covering the U.S. from 1993 to 2008, capital was reallocated toward productivity laggards over time, worsening the overall picture for the economy. For every 10% increase in real-estate prices, an industry would record a 0.6% relative decline in total-factor productivity due to the effect of skewed capital allocation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the field of research suggesting a similar effect focuses on China, showing that the country's particularly extreme real-estate boom is already eating away at productivity and the effective working of the economy. One paper shows that Chinese borrowing costs rise for manufacturing companies in places where housing booms are particularly extreme.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These sorts of findings, which haven't become a major topic of conversation among policy makers, could have huge implications for the way regulators and economists think about house prices and real-estate investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the mainstream view shifts toward the idea that real-estate booms cause capital misallocation so large that it becomes a drag on productivity, policy toward housing markets and the real-estate sector broadly could change considerably. The emerging research here is worth keeping an eye on.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth Accelerates</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth accelerated in September, as a widespread shortage of homes for sale spurred competition among home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 7% in the year that ended in September, up from a 5.8% annual rate the prior month. September marked the highest annual growth rate since May 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes, which make up the bulk of the housing market, rose 9.4% in September from a month earlier to the highest level since 2006, according to the National Association of Realtors. Record-low mortgage rates have increased demand, while the supply of homes for sale has remained low, especially at affordable price points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The delayed spring home-buying season fueled sales well into October and past the time when they would normally begin to slow down," said George Ratiu, senior economist for Realtor.com. "As the number of homes for sale keeps shrinking to new record lows, prices will continue to rise at a quick pace."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller 10-city index gained 6.2% over the year ended in September, compared with a 4.9% increase in August.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ana Suda and Martha Hernandez, both U.S. citizens, said their constitutional rights were violatedwhen they were detained outside the store in Havre for 40 minutes after an agent demanded theiridentifications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">U.S. Customs and Border Protection</span> said it didn't admit liability and added that "the overwhelming majority of CBP employees and officers perform their duties with honor and distinction, working tirelessly every day to keep our country safe."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The case emerged after Ms. Suda took a video of the May 2018 interaction in which she asked Agent Paul O'Neill why he was questioning them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Ma'am, the reason I asked you for your ID is because I came in here and I saw that you guys are speaking Spanish, which is very unheard of up here," Agent O'Neill said in the video. The women had validMontana driver's licenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In gathering information for the lawsuit, the <span class="companylink">ACLU</span> said Customs and Border Protection agents in northern Montana acknowledged they routinely profiled nonwhite people.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Justin Lahart and Laura Forman </div><div>675 words</div><div>25 November 2020</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B14</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America's housing market has been radically changed by the Covid-19 crisis, and some of those changes will persist. But the first thing to come after the crisis passes will be the hangover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Usually housing gets hammered in recessions, but during this downturn it has flourished. Desperate for outdoor space, many families decamped from cities for the suburbs. The ability to work remotely led to a surge in demand for second homes in vacation areas such as Cape Cod and Aspen. Historically low interest rates fueled the buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge in demand, particularly in towns, suburbs and exurbs near major cities, boosted prices. Redfin, an online real-estate platform, reports that median home prices were up 14.2% nationwide in October compared with a year ago. In Bridgeport, Conn., an area within commuting distance of New York City, median prices rose 39.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But just as the housing market has roared amid the coronavirus pandemic, it could cool with its passing -- at least temporarily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vaccines look as if they may become widely available by next spring and summer. That matters for the housing market because those seasons are historically when the most homes get sold: Data from the National Association of Realtors shows that about 40% of sales contracts for previously owned homes are signed over the four months starting in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vaccination could alter the calculus for city dwellers considering moves to the suburbs. If schools look as if they will go back to being in person next fall, the need for extra space becomes less pressing. Moreover, this year's spikes in home sales may have pulled forward housing activity that otherwise might have taken a few years to play out. Some urban couples who would normally have put off a suburban move until they had school-age children already have bitten the bullet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there will be long-term effects that could affect not just the housing market, but the overall economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having proven their ability to work remotely during the pandemic, more people will be able to work away from the office at least some of the time when the crisis is over. That makes the prospect of longer commutes to the office a little less onerous, increasing the appeal of living in the suburbs and exurbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owning a vacation home may now make more economic sense, too. The ability to work remotely for several weeks during school summer holidays, for example, makes a condo on the beach or bungalow in the mountains that much more enticing. By the same token, it may be easier to generate income renting to families looking for a similar remote work experience, which could be a win for home share platforms such as <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> and <span class="companylink">Expedia Group</span>'s Vrbo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies' experiences with remote work could embolden more of them to establish satellite offices in places where young workers are eager to live and where lower living costs make it possible to pay those workers less. That could be boon for cities such as Boulder, Colo., and Bend, Ore. The resulting changes in the housing market could have major effects on the economy. Fewer people commuting to work would reduce premiums on office space while taking a bite out of the sales of restaurants and retailers in business districts. Even slight sales losses could be a death sentence for businesses with low margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower tax revenues for cities losing population could pinch their finances, prompting them to raise taxes and reduce services, making them less attractive places to live. Municipalities on the receiving end of population shifts could boom, but will have to provide services and infrastructure to handle an influx of new residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where Americans decide to move after the Covid-19 crisis could alter far more than the housing market.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ryan Dezember </div><div>716 words</div><div>21 November 2020</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumber prices are making an unusual late-season climb, thanks to builder-friendly autumn weather and suppliers stocking up for what they expect to be another big year for home construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumber futures have shot up 27% so far in November, closing Friday at $630.10 per thousand board feet. That's a lot lower than the record $1,000 hit this summer during America's pandemic-induced lumber binge. But it is nearly twice the typical price for boards delivered in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"By any historical standards, this is just incredibly strong pricing," said Devin Stockfish, chief executive of Weyerhaeuser Co., which owns mills and is the country's largest private timberland owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wood inventories are thin throughout the lumber supply chain, while demand from builders and home remodelers remains strong, Mr. Stockfish said during an online real-estate investing conference this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're going to see some seasonal slowdown," he said, "but our expectation is that the builders are going to continue to build as much as possible until winter weather really starts restricting building activity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Autumn has proven especially accommodative for builders in the South, where demand from job sites -- and from restocking lumber dealers and distributors -- has buoyed prices for southern yellow pine, according to pricing service Random Lengths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family housing starts, a measure of home construction, climbed in October to its highest level since 2007, rising 6.4% over September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.179 million, the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span> said this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boom in single-family homes has offset a decline in apartment construction andhas been fueled by a flight to the suburbs, where home offices and outdoor space have become work-from-home must-haves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically low mortgage rates are attracting buyers, while investors are building thousands of suburban houses expressly to rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National <span class="companylink">Association of Home Builders</span> said this week that builder confidence hit its highest level since its monthly surveys began in 1985.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National <span class="companylink">Association of Home Builders</span>/<span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> Housing Market Index combines current sales, traffic from prospective buyers and sentiment toward the next six months. The November index hit 90 on a scale of 0 to 100, in which 50 represents neutral sentiment. A year ago it was 72.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In 32 years, the best market I have ever seen," D.R. Horton Inc. CEO David Auld told investors last week. "And it does feel sustainable, unlike what was a false demand in the last big upcycle."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span>, the country's most prolific builder, said it sold 78,458 houses during the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, a 39% increase over the preceding year. It expects to close deals on about 20% more houses in its current fiscal year than the one that just ended. The Arlington, Texas, company said the summer's record lumber prices will bite into margins in the present quarter, during which it expects to sell smaller homes, on average, but at higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes are also good for lumber demand, and they haven't been stronger since 2006, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Many sellers make repairs before they list homes, while buyers often move in with renovations in mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The repair and remodel market -- which exploded this year when Americans were stuck at home to slow the spread of Covid-19 -- typically accounts for about 40% of lumber consumption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country's biggest home-improvement retailers, <span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Lowe's Cos</span>., this week reported comparable sales for their recently ended quarters that were up 24% and 30%, respectively. Both said lumber sales were a big boost and that overall sales to do-it-yourself customers grew faster than those to professionals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lowe's CEO Marvin Ellison said on Wednesday that the retailer was riding a wave created by Americans' rush to redesign their homes to better suit their pandemic needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They took steps to shift their home to serve three primary purposes: a home school, a home office, and their primary location for recreation and entertainment," he said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales rose to a 14-year high last month, a rare bright spot for the economy as ultralow borrowing costs and the sudden shift in living preferences during the pandemic power the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">October's gains marked the fifth straight monthly increase and one of the best stretches for the housing market in several years. While home sales showed some signs of life before the coronavirus outbreak, they are running much hotter now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the pandemic, nothing has been more surprising -- positively surprising -- than single-family housing," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. As more people are working remotely, he said, "this is a fundamental shift in underlying housing preferences."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some families are leaving large cities or other crowded living circumstances in response to Covid-19. They have been willing to splurge on single-family homes despite a troubled job market and soaring home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers have been aided by mortgage rates now at their lowest level since <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> began tracking them in 1971, the agency said on Thursday, which could drive sales momentum into next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A severe shortage of homes for sale is boosting demand for newly built housing, which could spur more hiring and spending by home builders. Increased home sales can also lead to consumer spending on appliances, furniture and other home goods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P Homebuilders Select Industry index is up 24.2% this year, compared with a 10.8% rise for the S&amp;P 500, while shares of big builders such as <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>. have more than doubled since late March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for single-family homes has also extended to the rental market, where rents on single-family homes are rising at the fastest rate since last decade's foreclosure crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market activity could cool off next year, economists said, when policies that allow homeowners to temporarily suspend mortgage payments expire. That could prompt more distressed sales. But robust demand is expected to persist, as a large generation of millennials continues to age into their prime home-buying years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose 4.3% in October from September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.85 million, the highest level since February 2006, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. The October sales marked a 26.6% increase from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have climbed in recent months, especially for expensive homes, while the supply of homes on the market remains constrained. The median existing-home price rose 15.5% from a year earlier to $313,000, a record high nominally and adjusted for inflation, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home sales are just booming in the current environment," said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. "The upper-end market is really flying."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As home prices continue to rise, economists said affordability is a growing concern. Record-low interest rates have offset much of the effect of higher prices for consumers this year. But the shortage of homes for sale is leading to bidding wars, making it harder for first-time home buyers to enter the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some markets have been hotter than others this year, prices nearly everywhere have moved up of late. The median price for existing homes in each of the 181 metro areas tracked by <span class="companylink">NAR</span> was higher in the third quarter from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Erica Robinson said she and her husband, James Robinson, viewed dozens of properties and put in more than 10 offers before buying a four-bedroom home in Hemet, Calif., in October. They widened the geographic area they were searching in to find bigger houses within their budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had to decide, what are we going to sacrifice?" Ms. Robinson said. "I personally wanted to throw in the towel more than once."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents said demand remains high from shoppers looking for more space to accommodate working from home. Sales of homes priced at more than $1 million more than doubled in October compared with a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kristen Whitaker bought a three-bedroom townhouse with a small backyard in Philadelphia in October. "It truly was the low interest rates. I was like, 'Now is the time,'" she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and her boyfriend had been living in a two-bedroom apartment, and they wanted to move out of their busy multifamily building during the pandemic, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 1.42 million homes for sale at the end of October, down 2.7% from September and down 19.8% from October 2019, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>. At the current sales pace, there was a 2.5-month supply of homes on the market at the end of October, a record low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply shortage could worsen in the coming months as the number of newly reported Covid-19 cases rises because some would-be sellers are unwilling to put homes on the market, said Doug Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae. Many potential home sellers are older, he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Americans have spent more time at home during the public-health crisis, many have turned their attention to domestic projects, shifting money they would have otherwise spent on vacations, gym memberships and other activities that have been postponed to prevent the spread of the virus that causes Covid-19.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the pandemic, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> has offered some temporary benefits to workers, including more paid time off and a temporary weekly bonus program, leading to costs of about $355 million in the latest quarter. The company on Tuesday said it plans to make some of those enhancements permanent for its hourly associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We continue to lean into these investments because we believe they are critical in enabling market-share growth in any economic environment," Chief Executive Craig Menear said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales growth was fairly consistent throughout the quarter, with comparable sales in the U.S. rising 25% in August, 26% in September and 23% in October after adjusting for where Labor Day fell on the calendar. Growth accelerated further during the first weeks of November, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> said, as the company shifted to an earlier start for holiday sales events compared with last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Coronavirus cases are surging across the U.S.[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/livecoverage/covid-2020-11-17] this month, but Mr. Menear said the pandemic didn't appear to dent the company's results more in areas where the spread is more rampant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We see no correlation in the business as it relates to Covid cases," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>'s gross margin in the third quarter was 34.2%, down about 0.3 percentage point year over year.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose in every corner of the U.S. during the third quarter, as the pandemic boosted activity in a way not seen in recent history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for existing homes in each of the 181 metro areas tracked by the National Association of Realtors was higher in the third quarter from a year earlier, the association said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This broad-based rally for single-family homes marked the first time since 1980 that every metro area tracked by the <span class="companylink">NAR</span> posted an annual price increase in the same quarter.

</div><div class="author">By Nicole Friedman </div><div>736 words</div><div>12 November 2020</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pandemic is revving up the market for expensive homes where many people are spending far more time, luring richer buyers and nudging more sales over the half-million-dollar mark from northern California to the New York City suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly one in four home buyers between April and June bought houses priced at $500,000 or more, up from 14% of buyers during the preceding nine months, according to a Wednesday report from the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers during the coronavirus pandemic had a median household income of $110,800, compared with $94,400 for pre-pandemic buyers, the survey showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The buyers who purchase during Covid[-19] want a larger home," said Jessica Lautz, vice president of demographics and behavioral insights at NAR. "There's certainly more homes being purchased that are expensive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pandemic has caused the economy to sputter and businesses to close, a condition usually associated with slower home sales and lower home prices. But white-collar professionals have largely avoided the worst of the downturn. Many of those who can work remotely are seeking a bigger house with more outdoor space or are buying vacation homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surging demand that is pushing up home prices is also making homeownership harder to attain for lower-wage workers and for some younger buyers. First-time buyers made up 31% of all primary-home buyers in the year ended in June, down from 33% the year before and the historical norm of 40%, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pandemic buyers were less likely to have been denied by a mortgage lender, and many new homeowners rushed to lock in record-low mortgage rates. The median purchase price for pandemic buyers jumped 26% compared with pre-pandemic purchases to $339,400, according to the survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NAR</span> polled more than 8,000 people who bought primary homes in the year ended in June, though recent home sales data suggest these trends have continued since then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales had been relatively stagnant for several years heading into 2020. Then low interest rates and strong employment pushed existing-home sales to a 13-year high in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shelter-in-place restrictions, financial uncertainty and fears of Covid-19 infection damped the market during much of the spring. Home sales dropped for three straight months, hitting a 10-year low in May. The resurgence that followed surprised economists and real-estate brokers who failed to anticipate that the pandemic would spur so much new demand from buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists at <span class="companylink">NAR</span> forecast existing-home sales to total 5.4 million this year before jumping to 5.86 million next year, which would be the highest level since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sacramento was the most popular destination with buyers shopping outside their own metro area in the third quarter, according to real-estate brokerage <span class="companylink">Redfin Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employees at tech companies in the Bay Area who can now permanently work from home are drawn to Sacramento for its relative affordability, said Wendy Kay, a Coldwell Banker agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median Sacramento home-sale price rose 12.8% in the week ended Sept. 19 from a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">Zillow Group Inc</span>. Ms. Kay recently sold a two-bedroom house for $750,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's insane," she said. "But apparently it's still cheaper than the areas that they're coming from."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in Greenwich, Conn., are also booming as New York City residents shop for primary or second homes in the suburbs, said Jack Sarsen of Compass. Bidding wars and all-cash buyers have become more common.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The mortgage buyers that we've worked with have really unfortunately been cut out of the deal in many cases on the homes that they've wanted," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Boise, Idaho, metro area has experienced some of the fastest home-price growth in recent months. Steve and Michelle Klock, both 53 years old, bought their first home in Meridian, Idaho, in October. They got outbid multiple times before landing a three-bedroom house for $310,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In a market like this, the only thing you can feel right now is fortunate," Mr. Klock said. "If you don't get in, every day that you sit on the sideline you could be losing as much as $5,000 a week" as prices rise, he said.</p>

BP, Stricken by Low Oil Prices and High Debt, to Sell London Headquarters; British giant bought office block in Mayfair when oil demand seemed limitless and oil majors dominated stock market indexes</span>
</div><div class="author">By Sarah McFarlane </div><div>638 words</div><div>4 November 2020</div><div>11:51</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—<span class="companylink">BP PLC</span> is in talks to sell its London headquarters to help cover debt, punctuating the crisis facing the British oil giant and its peers as they navigate a pandemic that has decimated demand for oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">BP</span> bought the office block in the tony Mayfair section of London almost two decades ago, a time when it and its rivals enjoyed the prospect of growing oil demand and unrivaled stock-market valuations. Then-CEO John Browne had just pulled off the largest oil deal in history at the time, a move that triggered a series of other, big oil deals that created today's handful of supermajors—giant, integrated oil companies that pumped crude, refined it into gasoline and sold it at filling stations around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the outlook for those companies is dramatically changed. The new coronavirus pandemic has destroyed demand for crude amid economic lockdowns and other restrictions. Forecasters say it may take years to return to pre-Covid oil demand levels, if ever. <span class="companylink">BP</span> itself, in one long-term oil-market scenario it laid out earlier this year, forecast demand may never again hit 2019 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has triggered a year of heavy losses among the West's oil giants: <span class="companylink">Exxon Mobil Corp</span>., <span class="companylink">Chevron Corp</span>., <span class="companylink">Royal Dutch Shell PLC</span>, <span class="companylink">BP</span> and France's <span class="companylink">Total SE</span>. <span class="companylink">Shell</span> and <span class="companylink">BP</span> have cut dividends to preserve cash[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/shell-cuts-dividend-for-first-time-since-world-war-ii-11588235434], while <span class="companylink">BP</span> said it would seek to sell assets to help pare its especially high debt load.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares have fallen sharply, destroying market value. Earlier this year, <span class="companylink">Exxon</span>, for years America's most valuable company by market capitalization, lost its place in the prestigious[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/exxons-departure-from-dow-highlights-markets-retreat-from-energy-bets-11598390465] Dow Jones Industrial Average blue-chip stock index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">BP</span> bought the office at 1 St. James's Square in 2001 from Swedish telecommunications company Ericsson AB. Lord Browne had just taken advantage of a dip in oil prices to orchestrate the purchase of Amoco. It was the biggest foreign purchase of an American company at the time, spurring further oil-industry consolidation, including <span class="companylink">Exxon</span>'s acquisition of <span class="companylink">Mobil</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost 10 years later, a blowout at a BP offshore platform[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-judge-finds-bp-grossly-negligent-in-2010-deepwater-horizon-disaster-1409842182] in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 workers and led to the world's biggest maritime oil spill. Mired in financial penalties[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/bp-agrees-to-pay-18-7-billion-to-settle-deepwater-horizon-oil-spill-claims-1435842739] and other liability from the disaster, it shed billions of dollars of assets, greatly reducing its size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pandemic has delivered a second shock. <span class="companylink">BP</span> had already started to pivot to become less dependent on oil, while increasing its investments in low carbon energy[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/bp-bets-future-on-green-energy-but-investors-remain-wary-11601402304] such as wind and solar. Investors, though, haven't been convinced. <span class="companylink">BP</span> shares have fallen by more than half since the start of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, with a market capitalization of about $55 billion, had $40.4 billion worth of debt[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/bp-boosted-by-upstream-recovery-11603784985] at the end of September. It has said it is targeting reducing that to $35 billion, including through asset sales. Earlier this year, it sold its petrochemical business for $5 billion and a 49% stake in its U.K. retail sites for £400 million ($518 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A BP spokesman said if a sale of the headquarters is completed, it will lease back the space, where Chief Executive Bernard Looney and the rest of the <span class="companylink">BP</span> leadership team is based. The office has been mostly empty after <span class="companylink">BP</span> encouraged staff to work from home amid the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People familiar with the matter said <span class="companylink">BP</span> hopes to raise about £250 million ($324 million) through a sale to Hong Kong-based investor <span class="companylink">Lifestyle International Holdings Ltd</span>. Lifestyle International didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But his firm, which focuses on early-stage investments in tech companies in several Western states, has invested more than $28 million in 19 Montana tech companies, which together have raised an additional $174 million. On the salary front, with the increased venture-capital spending, he said, "I think we're going to start seeing some equalizing with out-of-state jobs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photos: A tappable looking at the evolution of office spaces, as told through popular films and TV shows</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also sees any talent influx as a positive. "I hope for us that it means we finally forge a tech culture in the local ecosystem," he said—a time when there are enough people in tech to create a natural networking effect. Three of his own friends, all in tech, have relocated from the Bay Area and New York since March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the ski-resort town of Park City, Utah, Casey Metzger, owner of the Top Shelf mobile bartending and consulting service, said all the newcomers have been a boon for local restaurants with outdoor dining, bike stores, guiding companies and construction companies. However, they also drive up costs for properties, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we don't pay attention to low-income housing, we're going to be in trouble," said Mr. Metzger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tiffany Fox, vice president of marketing for Summit Sotheby's International Realty, said that in the past three months, she has had a handful of people knock on her front door to ask if she's open to selling her house. (She's not.) </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said every weekend in town now feels like the Fourth of July—good for some but not as good for others. While the real-estate market pulled in $1.49 billion from July through September, residents are posting comments on the local <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> group expressing concerns about the newcomers, she added. "People are mourning Park City," said Ms. Fox.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jon Jessup, who founded the e-commerce software startup Cloud Conversion in Park City 12 years ago, said every time he takes his children to the park he meets tech workers who recently landed from San Francisco and New York. He recently played golf with a fellow ex-<span class="companylink">Oracle Corp</span>. employee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will Silicon Valley ever return to its former self, or are these changes permanent? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Normally I'd have to go to San Francisco to meet guys like me," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jessup had already had a couple of recent transplants ask his advice on starting companies of their own in Park City. But Covid-19 and the work-from-anywhere era have caused him to rethink his own operation: He's closing his Park City office and making his workforce fully remote. He also thinks anyone luring talent to Park City will have an uphill battle, as far as salary goes, because of the rising cost of housing. "They'd have to make $300,000 a year to be able to buy a house here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in Boise, the software company <span class="companylink">Clearwater Analytics</span> has already seen a handful of its 1,200 workers leave for big tech firms that offered them more money but didn't require them to relocate. "We're expecting this to be a trend that could actually be a significant issue for us," said Cindy Blendu, chief human-resources officer for Clearwater, which has 1,200 workers globally. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You now have all these people moving in from different markets bringing in all different types of compensation," she said, adding that she's continually evaluating whether her firm is keeping up with Boise's going rate for tech labor.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kalispell, Mont., is located near Flathead Lake. The 2020 Buyers Guide in Friday's Mansion section incorrectly said Bigfork Lake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ Nov. 3, 2020)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate is a local industry and, as a rule, varies widely from market to market. But when Covid detonated in March, even that constant was upturned: For two weeks or more, deals everywhere fell apart, closings were delayed, buyers didn't shop and sellers wouldn't let them in anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We worked with the data team at Realtor.com to find out what happened next. (<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from the National Association of Realtors.) The first step was for Realtor.com to analyze closed sales of homes at $1 million and up to find the 10 top buyer's and seller's markets nationwide. This process means that there is about a four-month lag between the home sales data and this guide, because it can take months for all of the counties to register the deeds in the public record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Normally, that lag isn't a big obstacle to understanding current conditions: Market dynamics tend to turn like slow-moving ocean liners. But this year was anything but normal. In some of our markets, the patterns observed in the Realtor.com data changed so dramatically throughout the summer that agents were reporting the exact opposite conditions once they were interviewed in the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To find out what is happening on the ground now, we interviewed over 50 agents and buyers in these markets. We also tapped Zillow for a list of the metro regions attracting the greatest number of luxury home searches by people who live in another region to give us a sense of where buyers are likeliest to flock next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is The Wall Street Journal's second annual Buyers Guide, a data-driven report on market conditions rich with advice from insiders on how to negotiate during this strange time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUYER'S</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARKET</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chandler Rapson, a 48-year-old private-equity investor and entrepreneur, sold one of his companies and was ready to buy his family the dream home they'd always wanted. His wife Roslyn had her eye on $2 million to $4 million homes in Hillsborough County, Fla., which is on the seller's market list. But Mr. Rapson smelled opportunity in one of the top buyer's markets on the list: Pinellas County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearwater and Clearwater Beach, like much of Pinellas County's real-estate market, were hard hit by the Covid crisis, said Michael Wyckoff, managing broker for Engel &amp; Volkers Madeira Beach. In Mr. Wyckoff's words, the Pinellas market "went into the fetal position" -- from March through June. Whole categories of buyers disappeared: Canadians -- once 10% to 15% of the buyer pool, Mr. Wyckoff estimated -- were unable to cross the border, and snowbirds from Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and upstate New York sheltered in place at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, things have picked up, numerous agents in the area agreed. But the house Mr. Rapson spotted this summer was a 5,300-square-foot Colonial-style waterfront home in Clearwater that was lingering on the market. It had originally been listed in mid-2019 for $1.6 million, but because it was outdated, buyers were turned off, Mr. Wyckoff said. Mr. Rapson estimated it needed about $500,000 to turn it into a true contemporary luxury home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I offered $1 million and I said 'you have 24 hours to take it or leave it,' " Mr. Rapson said. The seller came back asking for $1.1 million. The deal closed at the end of August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some counties that rank high on the buyers list have been that way for a while, as non-Covid factors, such as an oversupply of luxury product, were degassing the market long before Covid hit. New York City and commuter areas in New Jersey experienced this, and then got a double-whammy in the form of the worst regional health crisis of the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since March, buyers have been getting major discounts, said Megha Moza, an agent with Prominent Properties Sotheby's International Realty. Ms. Moza said one of her buyer clients had agreed to pay $1.1 million for a Weehawken, N.J., condo in April. Offers in this market are made verbally, so it hadn't been committed to paper. As the virus crisis wore on, her buyer decided he didn't want the property unless he could reduce his bid to $1.07 million, which was accepted. The deal closed in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other clients have received unprecedented incentives from builders, she said. For example, in March, a client who bid $1.3 million for a Jersey City condo got a free storage space, closing costs and a year of waived homeowner association fees -- a package worth $100,000, Ms. Moza said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The developer doesn't want to reduce the price that can be seen by the public. But they will offer incentives" to close a deal, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That brings the conversation to the curious case of Santa Barbara County, which ranked as the top buyer's market in this study. The statistics make it sound like a great opportunity to snap up a coastal resort home under optimal conditions. Unfortunately for buyers, even in a normal year, a high position on this list doesn't mean that these areas are rife with bargains. Instead, buyer's market conditions represent a downshift from the prior year -- which might have been smoking hot -- as well as the pace at which property is moving at current prices. Sometimes, these conditions lead to price reductions, but not always -- particularly if buyers storm back into the market and absorb the existing inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such was the case here in this unprecedented year, where roughly 10 real-estate agents laughed at the idea that buyers are controlling the current market in Santa Barbara County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is anything but a buyer's market. There is no inventory," said Wendy Gragg, the broker and owner of Distinctive Real Estate in Montecito.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtor.com's economic research analyst Nicolas Bedo credited the March freeze and subsequent surge for the disconnect between the data and the experience on the ground. "It's possible that downtown neighborhoods closer to the coast have experienced a more rapid recovery," he said. "The situation in changing quickly." Several agents who specialize in homes within Santa Barbara proper and Montecito said that after a dead March and slow April, droves of buyers began flooding in from Los Angeles, San Diego, New York and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents in Solvang and Santa Ynez, two agricultural areas of Santa Barbara County, understood why their market was described as favoring buyers in the early part of year, but also said that it is no longer true. Allan Jones, president of Santa Ynez Valley Real Estate Company, said while ranches typically take a long time to sell, "one started moving, then another, and now inventory is the lowest I've seen in 32 years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among buyers was Jon Lukas, who closed on a 5-acre property in Solvang at the end of August. Mr. Lukas, a 47-year-old investor, has lived in Santa Barbara County for years but dreamed of a larger property where his daughter Savannah, 11, could ride her horse. On a walk, he came across his new home, listed for $2.54 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The asking price might have been high for the area before Covid, said Patty Murphy, Mr. Lukas's agent at Sotheby's International Realty-Patty Murphy Country Estates. But in the pandemic-influenced market, demand for properties on larger parcels skyrocketed, she said. Mr. Lukas offered $2.37 million and leased the property back to the sellers for a month, charging them only $2,500 and running the risk that they would overstay. Everything worked out, however, and Mr. Lukas and his daughter moved in mid-October. Also making the move: Marble, Savannah's quarter horse, and Albert, Mr. Lukas's horse; Beatrice, Coco and Bon Bon, the family's goats; 20 chickens, a cat, a dog, a bunny and a piglet named Hamlet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT IS A</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUYER'S MARKET?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- The market has more supply than demand, with high levels of inventory and relatively low levels of sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Luxury sales prices -- the top 5% of the market -- were growing less than 1% or declining year over year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Negative year-over-year percentage change in both $1 million sales and absorption rates</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Markets have at least 30 monthly listings on average and at least one monthly $1 million sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Realtor.com analyzed closed sales from April to June 30, 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ADVICE FOR BUYERS IN</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A BUYER'S MARKET</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Ask for discounts: In a worsening market, a buyer holds the power as sellers fear not being able to replace the offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Time-limit the offer: As markets improve, sellers may use an offer to create urgency among other buyers. Setting a time limit -- such as 24 or 48 hours -- curtails the seller's power to create an auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Seek incentives on new construction: Developers want the public record to reflect higher prices so that comparable sales look strong. They are often willing to provide discounts via incentives that remain private: Ask for closing costs, HOA fees, free storage space, or design upgrades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Offer nonfinancial deal sealers: Make it easier for a seller to stomach a low offer by giving them the closing time they want or handling some repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SELLER'S</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARKET</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liz Lawson and Reed Kowit lived in Los Angeles for 10 years and fit right in. Ms. Lawson, 40, was busy as the music supervisor on a roster of television shows, and Mr. Kowit wrote screenplays and worked in production. Then Covid hit. Suddenly, their work evaporated, their 3-year-old son was isolated, and they wanted to be closer to their families, said Ms. Lawson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their target area: Arlington and Fairfax County, Va., which is the top seller's market in the country. In some ZIP Codes, over 40% of homes above $1 million are purchased within one month of listing, according to Realtor.com's data. The region is so hot, it occupies both the first and second top spots in the study, with nearby Alexandria City coming up as the next strongest seller's market. The couple's real-estate agent, John Eric of Compass, issued a warning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He told us it was a really hot market and to be prepared for it to be competitive," said Ms. Lawson, who now works as the author of young adult novels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The impact of Covid has seen a massive influx of buyers from around the country in our market," Mr. Eric said, citing Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York City as primary feeder cities. Some parts of the region have been seller's markets for several years, driven by demand from workers in government and technology jobs. Between April and June, demand for homes in Fairfax County, Falls Church, Arlington County and Alexandria City grew, according to Mr. Eric and other agents in the market, and has only intensified since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lawson and Mr. Kowit flew across the country in May and looked at homes, soon landing on a 5,000-square-foot, five-bedroom white farmhouse under construction and listed for $1.799 million in a part of Falls Church that lies within Fairfax County. Because it had another offer, Mr. Eric advised the couple of proffer their "best and final," which was $1.85 million in cash, with no design changes required. They got the home, which should be finished by early December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several of the top seller's markets on Realtor.com's list bear similarities to the region Ms. Lawson and Mr. Kowit coveted: They are suburban areas close to big employment centers that offer larger homes and lots and where new construction, home offices and pools are in high demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another such area is Essex County, Mass., north of Boston, where agents say demand has skyrocketed for luxury homes with beach access or water views. Syndi Zaiger of Nest Compass said that while "it's often difficult to sell homes of $3 million and up," times have changed. She had clients who got into a bidding war in July for a Manchester-by-the-Sea home listed for $2.949 million. The couple, who were about to get married, ended up getting it by offering the full asking price and no contingencies -- not even a home inspection, Ms. Zaiger said. The fiance then put his own home on the market, had his first showing the Thursday before Labor Day weekend, got two offers and went into contract that weekend for $1.77 million -- slightly below his $1.79 million asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In <span class="companylink">Riverside County</span>, about an hour east of Los Angeles, the late spring, summer, and fall boom took some agents by surprise. Rob Murray, owner of Crest Sotheby's International Realty who also owns an escrow company, said that in late March until about mid-April, 15% to 20% of his escrows canceled as deals fell apart and sellers took properties off the market. The market remained subdued throughout April and Mr. Murray steeled himself for major correction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was dead wrong," Mr. Murray said. Around May, he started to notice an influx of buyers and bizarrely high prices paid for homes that had been on the market for months and sometimes years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Mr. Murray's listings, a 7,845-square-foot, seven-bedroom hillside Mediterranean that had been listed for two years and was offered at $1.695 million, sold for $1.9 million. The buyers, who closed in mid-September, were Dwight and Luz Wilcox. Mr. Wilcox said they had lost out on a house in May, because it took the couple -- who co-own a trucking company and two insurance companies -- too long to get preapproved for a jumbo loan. When Mr. Wilcox saw his current home, he was determined to beat out any competitors, which led him to bid $205,000 above the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT IS A</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SELLER'S MARKET?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- The market has more demand than supply, with low levels of inventory and a high absorption rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Sales prices in the top 5% of the market are growing at or above 4% year over year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Positive yearly percentage change in both $1 million sales and absorption rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Realtor.com analyzed data from April to the end of June 2020, in markets with at least 30 monthly listings on average and at least three monthly $1 million sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ADVICE FOR BUYERS IN</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A SELLER'S MARKET</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Control the bidding war: Consider an "escalation addendum." It says a buyer will go a certain amount over the next best offer the seller receives, up to a given amount. A "best and final offer" draws the line. These tactics show a buyer's cards, but agents in competitive markets recommend this rather than a round robin of phone calls, which risks the seller picking a winner before all bids are in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Talk to jumbo lenders early: Since Covid, it is harder for self-employed people and business owners to qualify for jumbo loans. Before house hunting, get a lender or broker on your case and collect documentation about your business, assets and income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Weigh building your own: Sheltering in place means everyone wants home offices, pools and distance-learning spaces. Get quotes for prices and wait times to add these features to a new home -- some markets have yearlong waits for a pool installation. Know before you buy what you can build yourself and what is worth competing for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Waive contingencies: Home-sale contingencies are deal breakers in many hot markets. Consider waiving financing if you can prove funds and have a mortgage lender who will work fast or do the loan post-sale. Consider waiving a home inspection but only if a contractor can look at the house with you and give you a sense of potential issues and costs to repair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MIGRATION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DESTINATIONS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Erra, a 52-year-old insurance broker and moving-company co-owner, and wife Melissa Erra, lived in Minneapolis for 24 years. But in July -- when many Americans were realizing that working from home, remote learning and social distancing would be the new reality for a long time -- they picked up and moved to Las Vegas. Their new home, a $3.2 million, arts-and-crafts home with a pool and golf-course views, cost over $2 million more than the one they sold in Minneapolis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was paying 10.5% state income tax in Minnesota," a rate which has now dropped to zero in tax-free Nevada, Mr. Erra said. "Just the tax savings alone covered the cost of the house."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their migration to Las Vegas, the Erras had company. Searches by out-of-towners for homes over $1 million in the Las Vegas metro area surged by 155% from last year, according to Zillow's analysis. Ten agents and brokers in the area said they have never seen more relocation interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"More are driven to come here by high taxes in their states," said Heidi Kasama, the listing agent at Berkshire Hathaway Home Services Nevada Properties for the home the Erras purchased. Weather is also a draw. "We have a few hot months, but we don't have hurricanes or floods," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High on Zillow's list are several traditional vacation-home destinations, where local agents say demand is up as more people look for an escape from the city where they live full time and as more people are relocating now that they can work from home. Hilton Head, S.C., Jackson, Wyo., and the towns on Cape Cod, Mass., all saw big search growth. The number two spot on the list is held by Kalispell, Mont., the metro area of the Whitefish ski resort area, Glacier National Park and Bigfork Lake. Local agents say that after March, they got a surge in calls about both vacation and permanent homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been seeing this growth for the last five years, but it's on steroids now," said Stephanie Sunshine, a broker with National Parks Realty in Whitefish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Ms. Sunshine's buyers was Doug Allen, who closed on a $1.2 million log-cabin-style home in Kalispell in March. Mr. Allen, a 45-year-old scrap-metal business owner and his wife, Janel Allen, 49, live in Longview, Texas. Mr. Allen became familiar with the Kalispell area while working as a pilot for a cargo airline in his late 20s and vowed to one day make the region part of his life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home now serves as a part-time escape for the Allens and their three children, who spent much of the summer there, mountain biking, zip lining, alpine sliding, and fishing for trout and salmon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Austin, Houston and Dallas all showed out-of-town search increases since last year, which is no surprise to Marie Bailey, an agent with Fathom Realty in McKinney, Texas. After her own relocation from El Segundo, Calif., to Prosper, Texas, in 2017, she became a real-estate agent and the following year started a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> group called "Move to Texas from California!" The group now has over 21,000 members and has generated roughly 70 leads to whom Ms. Bailey has sold homes. Interest has surged since March, Ms. Bailey said, noting that many posts on the page express outrage over restrictions on business and education imposed by state and local government in California, Ms. Bailey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most of my members are looking for a lower cost of living," Ms. Bailey said. "They also feel there will be more political acceptance in Texas."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A search for cheaper luxury homes is driving interest in Salt Lake City, the third entry on Zillow's list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adam Kirkham, with Summit Sotheby's International Realty in Salt Lake, said that as of Oct. 1, there was 45% less inventory above $1 million compared with a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Anecdotally, buyers are coming from Los Angeles and the Bay Area, which is by far the highest feeder market from California," Mr. Kirkham said. "From the East Coast, it's from Virginia, the D.C. area, New York and Boston." Most transplants have some connection to Utah through family or having gone to school there, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, Mr. Kirkham participated in deals for five buyers relocating from out-of-state who paid between $2 million and $3.5 million in the suburb of Holladay, he said. In August, a buyer moving from Seattle paid $2.3 million for an 11,653-square-foot home Mr. Kirkham listed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of buyers have equity from more expensive markets, like in California, and they are bringing it with them to the Mountain West," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MIGRATION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DESTINATIONS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- The metro areas with the most page views for homes valued at $1 million and up by people who don't live in those metro areas, ranked by percentage increase since last year, according to an analysis by Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ADVICE FOR BUYERS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN A POPULAR</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MIGRATION DESTINATION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Ask about rentals: It is usually advisable to rent before buying in a new area, but in some markets with surging relocations, such as Salt Lake City, finding a luxury rental is tricky. Task a real-estate agent who wants to sell you a home with finding you accommodations during your search.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Quit your old state: For people relocating from high-tax to low- or no-tax states, quitting the former can be tricky as state auditors try to hold on. Talk to a local lawyer who specializes in these issues for the best advice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Know the new market: Agents say buyers who move from high-cost to lower-cost areas have two reactions: They get overly excited about the bargains and bid high, or they expect rock-bottom prices and bid low. Examine recent, closed sales in each neighborhood to get a realistic grasp.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Government-controlled mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> reported improved earnings for the third quarter, as record-low interest rates fueled a refinancing boom that buoyed the companies' results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The earnings are the latest evidence that the housing market remains a bright spot in the coronavirus-stricken economy. Sales of previously owned homes, which make up the bulk of the housing market, rose 2% in August from a month earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, the larger of the two companies, on Thursday said net income rose to $4.23 billion from $2.55 billion in the previous three months. Net income in the 2019 quarter was $3.96 billion. Fannie's smaller sibling, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, reported net income of $2.46 billion, up from $1.78 billion in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two companies reap fees from the mortgages they guarantee. As mortgages are refinanced, fees normally booked over the life of a loan can be booked immediately. The companies said their third-quarter earnings were boosted by their ability to book those fees more quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the companies reported a steady decline in the number of borrowers who have suspended payments as the labor market began to recover, suggesting reduced strain on their businesses. Some 4.1% of Fannie's single-family loans were in forbearance as of Sept. 30, down from 5.7% at the end of June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Vogel, executive vice president at FHN Financial, said that Fannie's results reflect "one of the better bottom lines in recent years," and show "acceleration in organic business with an improving single-family market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said Freddie produced "a strong quarter as well, with a little less zip than seen in Fannie's numbers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news wasn't all rosy. For the year as a whole, Fannie said it expects net income to be lower compared with 2019 because of the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. And it warned that the outlook remains cloudy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To recoup coronavirus-related costs, the companies are scheduled to impose a 0.5% surcharge on most on most refinanced mortgages that they back beginning Dec. 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie and Freddie run the plumbing that makes U.S. mortgages more readily available and affordable. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, by far the most popular in the U.S., wouldn't be as widely available without them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The companies don't make mortgages but buy them from lenders and package them into securities to sell to investors, and they provide guarantees to investors in case the mortgages go bad. They guarantee nearly half of the $11 trillion U.S. mortgage market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 30-year fixed rate mortgage averaged 2.81% in the week ended on Thursday, down from 3.78% a year ago, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firms were taken over by the government after they came close to collapse during the financial crisis of 2008. The Trump administration wants to return them to private hands, though they must raise tens of billions of dollars in additional capital before they will be able to operate fully independently -- a process that could involve years of accumulated earnings and potential new share sales.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Katherine Clarke </div><div>501 words</div><div>30 October 2020</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price for a house in the Hamptons, the string of beachfront communities on Long Island's eastern tip, skyrocketed by 40% to $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared with the year-earlier period, according to a report from brokerage <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge in prices is even more dramatic for homes on the ultrahigh end of the market, defined by the report as the top 10% of all sales. The median price for a home in that category was up by 65.7% year-over-year to $5.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The volume of sales in the Hamptons was up by 51% from last year and up by 291% for closings priced $5 million and up, according to Jonathan Miller of Miller Samuel, who prepared the report on behalf of Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said it is the first time he can remember seeing the Hamptons market deviate so much from that of Manhattan, since the two markets usually act in tandem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coronavirus upended that relationship as wealthy Manhattanites poured into the Hamptons at the onset of the pandemic and settled in for much longer than they initially expected. For some, the Hamptons has now become their primary home, at least for now, and some have enrolled their children at local schools and gotten accustomed to working remotely and attending meetings via Zoom. By comparison, sales were down by 46.3% in Manhattan in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've always described the Hamptons as being joined at the hip with Manhattan and with Wall Street," said Mr. Miller. Now, you have "the secondary market outperforming the primary market that it has depended on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Activity in the third quarter left Hamptons inventory 28.4% below the prior-year levels, with just a nine-month supply at the current sales pace. That's compared with about 19 months during the same period last year. Some of the Hamptons' biggest transactions of the third quarter included the $24 million sale of a seven-bedroom oceanfront compound with a tennis court in East Hampton and the $23.5 million sale of a 7.37-acre, eight-bedroom estate in Sagaponack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enzo Morabito, a luxury agent at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, said he has close to 20 high-end homes in contract right now, a number he called "beyond incredible." Some expensive plots of land have even started to trade after a slow couple of years. "That's usually the last thing to go," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While contract activity doesn't appear to be slowing down in the early fourth quarter, Mr. Miller said it is not clear if the Hamptons boom is built to last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right now we're at peak Zoom," he said. "It's not clear how much of this sticks once there's a vaccine."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nicole Friedman </div><div>662 words</div><div>28 October 2020</div><div>09:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insurance companies retreated from selling home insurance in wildfire-prone parts of California in 2019, new state data shows, making it more difficult and expensive for homeowners in those areas to protect their houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The availability of standard home insurance in fire-prone areas could shrink further after another round of wildfires[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/northern-california-wildfires-in-napa-and-sonoma-counties-force-the-evacuation-overnight-of-thousands-of-residents-11601302102] struck the state earlier this year. New fires in Southern California prompted the evacuation of thousands of homes on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the Covid-19 pandemic has prompted some city dwellers[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/remote-work-is-reshaping-san-francisco-as-tech-workers-flee-and-rents-fall-11597413602] to take advantage of the ability to work remotely and move to more remote and cheaper parts of California, real-estate agents say. This new wave of demand has pushed up home prices around the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combination is worsening the housing affordability crisis in some fire-prone parts of California, especially the Sierra Nevada region, agents say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a first-time home buyer, "it's kind of like you're getting hit from all angles," said Erik Segerstrom, president of the Tuolumne County Association of Realtors, in the Sierra Nevada area. "They're having to budget more money towards insurance rather than their loan, and there's few options [of homes to buy] in the affordable range for them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insurance companies declined to renew about 235,000 home policies in 2019, a 31% increase from the prior year, the state insurance regulator said. In ZIP Codes with moderate to high fire risk, nonrenewals rose 61%. They increased by 203% in the top 10 counties for wildfire risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As traditional insurers pulled back in those regions, more Californians have bought coverage from the state's insurer of last resort, the California FAIR Plan. The number of FAIR Plan policies grew 36% statewide in 2019 to about 190,000. In ZIP Codes with moderate to high fire risk, the number of FAIR Plan policies more than doubled, the state said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FAIR Plan policies are typically more expensive than regular insurance policies and don't include some standard coverages like liability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insurance companies reduced their wildfire exposure in recent years after paying more than $24 billion for California wildfire losses in 2017 and 2018. This year's wildfires in Northern California caused an estimated $3 billion to $5 billion in insured losses as of Sept. 20, according to catastrophe modeler RMS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">California Association of Realtors</span> found in a survey of its members last year that 27% had issues with fire insurance[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/high-cost-of-wildfire-insurance-hurts-california-home-sales-11578220200] either personally or with their clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The disruption that nonrenewals cause in communities following the wildfires is just one more stress that Californians cannot afford," said Ricardo Lara, the state's insurance commissioner, at a state investigatory hearing Oct. 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2012, median home prices in ZIP Codes in California, Oregon and Washington with low wildfire risk have increased by 101%, while median prices in high wildfire-risk ZIP Codes in the three states rose by 88%, according to an analysis by real-estate brokerage <span class="companylink">Redfin Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The faster price growth in low-risk ZIP Codes has pushed more people into fire-prone areas, a trend that has accelerated in recent months, said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are migrating more and more into these high-risk areas," Ms. Fairweather said. But "the thing that's going to make it less desirable is insurance costs, the fact that people realize it's not more affordable when you factor in insurance."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The insurance industry is calling for changes[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/no-one-can-agree-on-how-to-price-california-home-insurance-for-wildfires-11568649298] to California's regulatory process for approving insurance prices. "We want the price of the insurance to reflect the risk of the property that we're covering," said Mark Sektnan, vice president for state government affairs for the American Property Casualty Insurance Association.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rose 5.7% in Year</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 5.7% in the year that ended in August, up from a 4.8% annual rate the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes, which make up the bulk of the housing market, rose 2% in August from a month earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors, as low mortgage-interest rates and a desire for more space lured buyers into the market. A shortage of homes for sale has led to competition among buyers and pushed home prices higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Current home price growth is exceptionally strong given that the U.S. is an economic recession," said Selma Hepp, deputy chief economist at housing-data provider <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>. "It is the historically low inventories and record-low mortgage rates that are outweighing economic and employment headwinds and fueling the price acceleration."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that the homeownership rate rose to 67.4% in the third quarter, up from 64.8% a year earlier but down from 67.9% in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the department said that its data collection was affected by the coronavirus pandemic and its survey response rates declined from last year, which could affect the accuracy of its second- and third-quarter estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix had the fastest home-price growth in the country for the 15th straight month, at 9.9%, followed by Seattle at 8.5%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A woman who was shot by police last week in suburban Chicago said officers did nothing more than cover her boyfriend with a blanket after he was shot and left him on the ground to die.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tafara Williams, 20 years old, spoke to reporters Tuesday in a Zoom call from her hospital bed as she described the Oct. 20 shooting in Waukegan that killed 19-year-old Marcellis Stinnette.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They allowed him to die," Ms. Williams said. "They wanted us to bleed out on the ground."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Police have said the vehicle driven by Ms. Williams, with Mr. Stinnette in the passenger's seat, fled a traffic stop conducted by a white officer. They said that a short time later, another officer, who is Hispanic, approached the vehicle, and he opened fire out of fear for his own safety when the vehicle moved in reverse toward him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, the police department fired the officer who shot them. Waukegan Mayor Sam Cunningham said last week that dashcam and bodycam videos of the shooting would be made public after relatives of the shooting victims have watched it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gun-rights groups accused Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson of exceeding her authority in banning people from openly carrying guns within 100 feet of voting sites.

</div><div class="author">By Te-Ping Chen </div><div>1033 words</div><div>23 October 2020</div><div>11:42</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some houses have skeletons in their closets. For Jessica Mack, the skeleton was hanging by the front door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A first-time buyer in the Philadelphia area, Ms. Mack, 26 years old, had been browsing property listings for months before finding one in September that looked just right: a cozy Cape Cod, with a nice lawn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It wasn't too big, it wasn't too small. It was cute," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet for years, the house's owner had hung a fake skeleton outside her front door in all seasons, regularly swapping out its attire. Some days it wore a white blouse, on others, a green bodysuit. The owner said she would accept Ms. Mack's offer if she would maintain the tradition, 365 days of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the third house Ms. Mack, a local utilities worker, had bid on. She said yes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A typical sales contract comes with various contingencies, such as ones that allow buyers to back out if they can't obtain financing or if issues come up during a home inspection. Now, amid a historic housing shortage that gives sellers the upper hand, some buyers are finding themselves confronted with the oddest requests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm selling a house right now that is being sold with the cat," says Eli Karon, a real-estate agent with Karon Properties in Santa Cruz, Calif. The orange tabby has lived there for years, he says, and its owners don't want to move him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house has attracted six offers and is currently under contract. "It's definitely a seller's market," says Mr. Karon. (He says the cat is friendly and up-to-date on shots.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Chicago, Ill., real-estate agent Jamie Lemmons once sold a home in which the owners, a pair of retirees, asked for the right to continue visiting the backyard grave of their beloved golden retriever, Buffy. The buyers agreed and lawyers added an addendum to the contract stipulating Sunday visiting hours between 12 and 2 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While refrigerators and light fixtures are standard fare, some buyers demand more exotic add-ons. In one recent house purchase, Ms. Lemmons' client said he would buy the house contingent on the seller giving up a neon <span class="companylink">Chicago Blackhawks</span> sign he had seen during the house tour. "He said, I'm telling you, if you don't get me that <span class="companylink">Blackhawks</span> sign, that deal is off," she says. The seller was willing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Naples, Fla., the sale of a fully furnished home broke down at the start of the pandemic after the buyers objected to the seller removing a 6-foot flamingo statue from the house. "I said, to be clear, you don't want this house anymore because of the pink flamingo?" says Adam Sheets, the buyers' agent. "They were serious."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents say often they prefer to keep unusual agreements off contracts involving financing to avoid having a lender look askance. Many are verbal and unenforceable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such was the case when Greg Gasior, 52, sold his house in West Palm Beach, Fla., in September and asked the buyers to assume responsibility for the feral cats that frequented his backyard, fearing they would otherwise go hungry. He bought the new owners multiple cases of canned cat food along with paper plates, which he asked them to use for serving so the cats wouldn't cut their tongues on the cans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They were like, um, OK," says Mr. Gasior, who works in property management. The buyers have sent over a photo showing they are fulfilling the obligation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What demands would you make on selling your home?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So long as it isn't harming anyone, I don't see why not," says Sabina Dinescu, a real-estate agent with <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> in Pinecrest, Fla., of odd seller requests. Ms. Dinescu sold a house last year for a widow who made the sale of her house contingent on the new buyer keeping her husband's ashes in a safe in a partitioned area behind the master bedroom's closet, a requirement the seller drafted into the contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Ms. Dinescu's astonishment, the buyer agreed to the terms. "They didn't seem too bothered," she said. "The house had a lot of natural light, and it was at a great price point."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say they have to walk a fine line in dealing with offbeat client demands, not wanting to alienate either side of a deal. In one recent transaction in San Diego, Calif., Raquel Benguiat said her buyer fell in love with a seller's pair of dog statues outside the entrance and repeatedly asked for them during negotiations. "I told them, you gotta stop it with the dogs, because the owner is getting very upset," she recalls. Ms. Benguiat bought her clients a replacement set.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In central Oregon, real-estate agent Chris Sperry has also played peacemaker. Ms. Sperry represented a buyer and seller in a transaction where the buyer insisted she wanted the seller's cat along with the house. The seller balked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It really got into a heated argument on both sides," she says. The seller finally agreed to leave her cat, and Ms. Sperry bought her a replacement kitten.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years ago Monica Lara, a government employee in Roseville, Calif., bought a home from an owner who was downsizing and wanted to leave his pet beagle behind. It had been the family dog, and his children had grown up and moved away. Ms. Lara and her husband, who have two young sons, said they would let the dog stay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller said the dog was housebroken, which proved to be untrue. But the beagle was affectionate and the kids loved to walk him around the neighborhood. The family featured him in their Christmas photos for several years, until he suffered renal failure and passed away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lara, 51, has no regrets about taking him in. "The dog got a family that loved him," she says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Craig Karmin </div><div>650 words</div><div>22 October 2020</div><div>14:10</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A low-profile New York City-based hotel investor is the mystery buyer of the Beverly Hills hotel that the <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> sold in August, after seizing it from the fugitive Malaysian financier Jho Low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EOS Investors LLC, a three-year old firm that owns and manages about 20 hotels, won the bidding process and on Thursday completed its purchase of the Viceroy L'Ermitage Beverly Hills hotel, according to the firm and the auction's broker. A sales representative had said previously that the winning bid for the hotel was $100 million, but he didn't disclose the buyer's identity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale marked the last of Mr. Low's major properties to be auctioned by federal authorities, who allege he bought the hotel and other assets with money embezzled from a Malaysian government fund. U.S. and other authorities have previously sold Mr. Low's private jet, luxury yacht, and his stake in the Park Lane Hotel[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/judge-clears-plan-by-u-s-and-steven-witkoff-to-sell-park-lane-hotel-1487724667] overlooking Manhattan's Central Park, among other possessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The L'Ermitage, an all-suite hotel located near the city's posh Rodeo Drive, has attracted numerous entertainment moguls, foreign jet-setters, and movie stars over the years like Elizabeth Taylor and Laurence Olivier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also drew widespread interest from a crowd of potential buyers, said Matthew Bordwin, principal at Keen-Summit Capital Partners LLC, the firm that ran the sales process. There were about 800 potential buyers who expressed interest from all over the world—"from every continent but Antarctica," Mr. Bordwin said—and 50 bids for the hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, none would top EOS's offer. That price was the so-called stalking-horse bid, established to set a floor as the lowest price to complete a sale but one that also proved to be the high bid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of factors prevented an even richer bid, including the brutal hotel environment during Covid and the travel restrictions that could have kept potential foreign buyers away, say people familiar with the process. The U.S. luxury segment has been hit particularly hard by the pandemic and the collapse of business travel: Revenue per available room in September fell 55% from a year ago, compared with only a 21% decline for economy class hotels, hotel data firm STR said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some also believed the price for the 116-room property was too steep at nearly the rate of $860,000 per room. But EOS President Jonathan Wang said the property represented a rare opportunity to enter the coveted Beverly Hills market and would prove to be a good long-term investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our plan is to bring back more luxury elements and make it a top destination in the market," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the previous owner, Mr. Wang added, "it adds some mystery to the hotel."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Low was an adviser to a Malaysian government investment fund, known as <span class="companylink">1Malaysia Development Bhd</span>., or 1MDB. The <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> alleged he stole from the fund, and he agreed last year to forfeit[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/accused-mastermind-of-1mdb-close-to-civil-settlement-with-doj-11572473653] more than $700 million in assets. Mr. Low has denied any wrongdoing and remains at large.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Low acquired the hotel for $46 million in 2010 and spent about $37 million additionally on renovations that brought the property 5-star ratings from various travel guides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wang, whose other properties are concentrated in major cities or resort destinations and include the Hamilton Hotel in Washington, D.C., said the L'Ermitage is open but hasn't been immune to the industry downturn. He said it is booking rooms for an average of $500 a night, though revenue is down about 60% from a year ago.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Justin Lahart </div><div>566 words</div><div>22 October 2020</div><div>11:05</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been an unexpected winner during the Covid crisis. But what will it look like when the crisis has passed?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing usually gets trounced during recessions, but the Covid downturn is different. After falling sharply during the spring shutdowns, sales of both new and existing single-family homes came roaring back, and now are well above their precrisis levels. The National Association of Realtors on Thursday reported that sales of existing, or previously owned, homes rose by a seasonally adjusted 9.4% in September[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/existing-home-sales-rose-9-4-in-september-11603375549] from August and were up 21% above their year-earlier level. Sales of single-family homes—both existing and newly built—have been particularly robust and would likely be even higher if the inventory of available homes wasn't so low. In the absence of adequate supply, prices have gone up instead[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/americans-want-homes-but-there-have-rarely-been-fewer-for-sale-11600680612].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are, broadly, three forces behind housing's resurgence. First, while the crisis has put millions out of work, those job losses have been concentrated in lower-paying services industries, so those hit hardest tend not to have the means to buy a house in any circumstances. Meanwhile, the higher-income earners who generally can afford a house have weathered the downturn much better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, the downturn, and the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> easing efforts it brought forth, have led to a sharp decline in borrowing costs. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage has fallen to 2.8%—its lowest level on record—from 3.7% at the start of the year. That has made it, on balance, easier for many people to afford a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, the pandemic has prompted many people to move away from urban centers, such as New York City, to more socially distant accommodations in the suburbs, while the work-from-home revolution has convinced some to move even farther afield. There has also been an increase in demand for vacation and second homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Postcrisis, however, working remotely from a vacation enclave might not be as easy as some expect. And it might not take more than one winter for people who have fled to rural redoubts to decide that country life isn't for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the bigger issue is that the crisis may have, in effect, pulled forward a lot of housing activity that would have eventually happened in any case. Couples with children throwing in the towel and moving to the suburbs isn't exactly a new phenomenon, after all. Many of the people who decamped this year might have otherwise done so over the next few years. So when the Covid crisis ends, the pool of people ready to take flight to the suburbs might be smaller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And regardless of where they now live, the absolute number of people able to make the move to homeownership may be limited as well. Many members of the millennial generation saw early career setbacks following the financial crisis, and now, as they enter their prime earning years, another crisis has struck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, how the housing market will perform in the post-Covid world will depend on how robust the economy proves to be, and the degree to which the scars the pandemic has caused fade. The jury is still out.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nicole Friedman </div><div>905 words</div><div>22 October 2020</div><div>14:38</div><div>WSJ Pro Central Banking</div><div>RSTPROCB</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2020, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales rose to a new 14-year high in September, bolstered by robust demand and a shortage of homes for sale that is making the housing market one of the brightest spots for the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose 9.4% in September [https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/existing-home-sales-soar-9-4-to-6-5-million-in-september]from August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.54 million, the highest rate since May 2006, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. The September sales marked a 20.9% increase from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest figures for existing-home sales, which make up most of the housing market, marked the fourth straight monthly increase and one of the best stretches for the housing market in years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents and economists credit the strong demand for housing to record-low interest rates[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-signals-interest-rates-to-stay-near-zero-through-2023-11600279214], a large population of millennials entering prime homebuying years[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/millennials-help-power-this-years-housing-market-rebound-11598520601] and a desire for more household space driven by the coronavirus pandemic[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/news/collection/coronavirus0312-256f2943]. As many people work and attend school from home, home shoppers are willing to move farther from their offices in exchange for bigger houses with more outdoor space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home prices are simply rising too fast due to insufficient supply and very strong demand," said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A very limited supply of homes [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/suburban-home-prices-are-rising-but-so-are-most-urban-home-prices-11597331394]for sale, especially in lower price tiers, pushed prices to new highs. The median existing-home price rose 14.8% from a year earlier to $311,800, a record high nominally and adjusted for inflation, NAR said, and the highest annual median price increase in 15 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. jobless claims fell last week to their lowest level since March[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/weekly-jobless-claims-coronavirus-10-22-2020-11603317268], the Labor Department said Thursday, raising hopes that the economy could be starting to mend following pandemic-related lockdowns and layoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been one of the economy's few consistent areas of strength since sales picked up in the spring. Strong home sales can create more construction jobs and lead to more spending [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/us-economy-september-retail-sales-coronavirus-recovery-11602786924]on home goods such as furniture and appliances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing data reflecting building and new-home sales has also been bullish. A measure of U.S. home-builder confidence rose to a record high in October in data going back to 1985, the National <span class="companylink">Association of Home Builders</span> said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts, a measure of U.S. home-building, rose 1.9% in September from August, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Residential permits, which can be a bellwether for future home construction, increased 5.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a pre-existing shortage of homes has worsened in recent months, as buyers flooded into the market and sellers held off on listing their homes. There were 1.47 million homes for sale at the end of September, down 19.2% from a year ago, according to NAR. At the current sales pace, there was a 2.7-month supply of homes on the market at the end of September, the lowest level on record in data going back to 1982.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Phoenix, for example, total for-sale listings in the week ended Oct. 10 fell 21% year-over-year and home values rose almost 12% in September from a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">Zillow Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses often stay on the market for less than a week, said R.J. Apana, who closed on a four-bedroom house in Phoenix in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those good properties that have what you're looking for amenity-wise and then also fit into your budget, those usually don't last too long," he said. "When you are looking and find something you like, you have to be very aggressive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory shortage could slow the sales pace in the coming months, economists say. Home sales increased most strongly in September for homes priced at $750,000 and above, according to NAR. "Home sales are occurring where there is inventory—on the upper-end market," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some workers are moving from high-cost coastal cities to more affordable locales, making those markets more competitive. Of 87 large metro areas tracked by real-estate brokerage <span class="companylink">Redfin Corp</span>., only San Francisco and New York City posted an annual increase in the number of homes for sale in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Urban and city centers are seeing what I would call a demise in demand," said Mike Miedler, chief executive of Century 21 Real Estate LLC, a subsidiary of <span class="companylink">Realogy Holdings Corp</span>. Meanwhile, "in some places, like Jacksonville, like Salt Lake City, like Sacramento, the [prices] are through the roof. They're getting astronomical."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose the most month-over-month in the Northeast, at 16.2%, and in the West, at 9.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, so the September figures largely reflect purchase decisions made in August or July.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nicole Friedman </div><div>806 words</div><div>21 October 2020</div><div>08:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooklyn's housing market is showing fresh signs of life, boosted by home buyers seeking more space and lower prices than across the river in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Covid-19 pandemic[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/news/collection/coronavirus-6dcf2a21] and subsequent shelter-in-place restrictions this spring prompted some New Yorkers to decamp to second homes[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/east-coasters-are-snapping-up-vacation-homes-amid-coronavirus-11594915853], move in with family outside the city, or relocate to the suburbs[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-housing-market-around-new-york-city-is-booming-11592227115].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real-estate industry watchers forecast an exodus from the city[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/people-were-leaving-new-york-city-before-the-coronavirus-now-what-11587916800], as urbanites switched to working from home and sought more living space. Manhattan has been especially hard hit. New contract signings fell 42% from year-ago levels in September, according to brokerage <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Brooklyn started picking up again over the summer. Newly signed contracts exceeded year-ago levels for three straight months through September, according to <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>. September contracts rose 21% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The urban-to-suburban narrative is actually a Manhattan-to-suburban narrative, or a Manhattan-to-other-borough narrative," said Jonathan Miller, chief executive of appraisal firm Miller Samuel Inc. Brooklyn activity has ramped up since the end of the lockdown in June, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the third quarter overall, pending sales in Brooklyn dropped 11% from a year earlier but surged 157% from the second quarter, when the market was largely shut down due to the pandemic, according to brokerage <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Activity in Brooklyn could decline again this fall. The borough is home to someCovid-19 hot spots[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/new-york-city-may-soon-lift-restrictions-on-some-covid-19-hot-spots-11603133738], where the state has tightened social-distancing restrictions. Gov. Andrew Cuomo closed schools and nonessential businesses earlier this month in parts of Brooklyn including Borough Park and Midwood. The restrictions ban in-person real-estate showings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other neighborhoods are drawing buyer interest as new supply hits the market, offering renters the opportunity to own. Brooklyn for-sale listings hit an eight-year high in the third quarter, up 11% from a year earlier, according to Corcoran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amy Bisno and her partner started shopping for an apartment in Brooklyn at the beginning of the year, stopped when the pandemic erupted and then resumed this summer. They had an offer accepted on a two-bedroom apartment this month in Park Slope, the same neighborhood where they have been renting a one-bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had moments of thinking of leaving the city [but] said, 'This is where our home is, and we'll get through this,' " Ms. Bisno said. "I feel like the people who are buying now are those who really intend to stay."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers are pouncing now that Brooklyn prices have dipped after years of running up in borough hot spots. Christine Wong and Addison Chen had looked for an apartment to buy pre-pandemic but struggled to find good options in their budget. When the market reopened this summer, Brooklyn apartments that would previously be listed above $1 million were listed at $800,000 or $900,000, Ms. Wong said. "We were like, this has to be it," she said. "Now the places we actually wanted were in our price range."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wong and Mr. Chen lost out on a condo in Cobble Hill to another buyer before having an offer accepted on a two-bedroom apartment in downtown Brooklyn last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the median Brooklyn sales price in the third quarter was $689,000, Corcoran said, edging up 3% from a year earlier, while the average price for a square foot in Brooklyn held steady from a year ago at $930. That is less than half of Manhattan's average of $2,065 a square foot, Corcoran said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The attraction to Brooklyn is really just more space, and the options of being able to get outdoor space are much more available and in a price range that's really attractive," said Noemi Bitterman of Compass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooklyn apartments are continuing to sell at or near their asking prices, while Manhattan apartments are often selling at a discount, according to real-estate data company UrbanDigs Analytics LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers are less willing to pay a premium these days to live near Manhattan's offices and amenities, said John Walkup, UrbanDigs's co-founder. Manhattan inventory rose 28% year-over-year to hit the highest level since 2009, according to Corcoran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maurice Collada and Casey Calhoun bought a three-bedroom apartment in Park Slope this month. They have been renting a two-bedroom in the neighborhood and, with a second child on the way, wanted more space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We didn't get what was, in my dreams, the 'Covid bargain,' " Mr. Collada said. But "in non-Covid times, it might have fallen into a bidding war and we would have been priced out."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday: U.S. housing starts are likely to have resumed their upward trajectory in September after an unexpected decline in August. The housing market has been an economic bright spot as the country tries to recover from spring coronavirus lockdowns, helping support consumer spending and construction employment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday: U.S. jobless claims have held at stubbornly high levels in recent weeks, underscoring continued layoffs and economic dislocation, even as the labor market heals from spring lockdowns.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's gross domestic product and U.S. housing highlight a relatively quiet week for economic data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail sales, export and other economic data show China is shaking off the effects of the coronavirus. Gross domestic product figures are likely to underscore the rebound. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expect third-quarter GDP to rise 5.3% from a year earlier. That would be up from 3.2% growth[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chinas-economy-picks-up-speed-as-shoppers-moviegoers-return-11600157539] a quarter earlier and approaching the 6.1% rate for all of 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts are likely to resume their upward trajectory in September after an unexpected decline in August. The housing market has been an economic bright spot as the country tries to recover from spring coronavirus lockdowns, helping to support consumer spending and construction employment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. jobless claims have held at stubbornly high levels[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/weekly-jobless-claims-coronavirus-10-15-2020-11602714104] in recent weeks, underscoring continued layoffs and economic dislocation even as the labor market heals from spring lockdowns. Figures for the week ended Oct. 17 are expected to show a small decline in applications for unemployment benefits from a week earlier—but still leave them well above the pre-pandemic record of 695,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. existing home sales are expected to rise in September for a fourth straight month, fueled by demand for more space[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-continued-to-climb-in-august-11600784199] and by rock-bottom mortgage rates. The housing market has been one of the economy's hottest sectors in recent months, pushing prices to new highs and sales to their fastest pace since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surveys of purchasing managers are expected to indicate that the eurozone's economic recovery stalled in October as governments imposed fresh restrictions to contain a resurgence in new coronavirus infections. Similar surveys are expected to indicate that the U.S. economy is continuing to grow, albeit at a slower pace.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nicole Friedman </div><div>595 words</div><div>13 October 2020</div><div>08:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales are booming in popular vacation spots, as the pandemic leads more Americans to seek places to work or relax within driving distance of home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In traditional vacation destinations such as Key West, Fla., Ocean City, N.J., and Traverse City, Mich., online house shopping and pending sales are up relative to the country overall, according to a new analysis by <span class="companylink">Zillow Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar to the recent rise in interest for suburban and rural homes[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/renters-flock-to-suburbia-upending-decadelong-urbanization-trend-11602581401?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=2] that are a car ride from major cities, the growth in demand for homes in vacation towns[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/lake-tahoe-vail-arent-just-for-vacation-anymore-as-homebound-families-move-in-11598434201]shows how Covid-19 is reshaping home shoppers' priorities, said Jeff Tucker, senior economist at Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home shoppers are particularly motivated to shop for a home in these markets because right now they have the freedom to probably work from home in many cases and even have their kids go to school from home," he said. "They would get a lot more time to actually enjoy the natural amenities in these locations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 20 U.S. metro areas with the highest share of vacation homes, page views of for-sale listings on Zillow in August rose more than 50% from a year earlier, while nationwide page views rose 37% in the same month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 12 of those markets, including Hilton Head, S.C., and East Stroudsburg, Pa., in the Poconos region, pending sales in the week ended Sept. 26 were up more than 30% from a year earlier. Nationally, pending sales rose 22% year-over-year in the same week, Zillow said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have you bought or sold a home during the pandemic? Share your experience. Join the conversation below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pandemic-driven recession has deepened the country's economic divisions. Many higher-wage workers who are able to work from home can put money they would have spent on entertainment or international travel toward buying a home. Home sales around the country have risen to the highest level since 2006, buoyed by record-low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second or vacation homes are rising as a percentage of all mortgages. Mortgage-rate locks for second-home purchases made up 5.3% of all locks for purchases in the week ended Oct. 9, up from 3.9% at the start of the year and 4% in the same week last year, according to the <span class="companylink">American Enterprise Institute</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
U.S. home prices have risen[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/americans-want-homes-but-there-have-rarely-been-fewer-for-sale-11600680612] 3.1% since February, according to Zillow. Some vacation spots have posted stronger gains, including Ocean City, up 6.4% in the same period, and Sevierville, Tenn., up 4.9%, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Panama City, Fla., metro area, Zillow page views in August were up 74% from a year earlier. Pending sales in the week ended Sept. 26 rose almost 24% year-over-year, Zillow said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've always been a drive-to destination, which during this pandemic has been vital for people" who want to travel while staying distanced from strangers, said Jonathan Spears, a team leader at Scenic Sotheby's International Realty, which sells homes in the Panama City area. "We've never seen a market like this, and it's specifically due to this pandemic."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some buyers are permanently relocating to the region, many are second-home shoppers who expect to rent out the homes part of the year, he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than half of the 76 homes sold in July in Aspen, Colo., which included condominiums and single-family homes, sold for more than $5 million. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said 145 Aspen home-sales contracts were signed in July and that more than half of those were for homes priced at more than $20 million, based on incorrect data. An earlier version also incorrectly referred to the Smuggler area of Aspen as Smugglers Cove. (Corrected on Oct. 2)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ASPEN, Colo.—Prices have gotten so high here that a $1.8 million home late last year was included in an affordable-housing lottery by the Aspen Pitkin County Housing Authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That home has yet to sell, but plenty of others in Aspen have. The mountain resort town is part of a real-estate trend playing out in places such as New York's eastern Long Island shore and in Lake Tahoe, Calif., where home prices have surged as wealthy urbanites look for space[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/home-sales-surge-in-resort-towns-covid-11601556684] and outdoor amenities during the pandemic and while working from home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aspen is attracting affluent buyers from both coasts and Texas. July home-sales contracts jumped more than fivefold over that same month a year earlier, a surge that appraiser Jonathan Miller called unprecedented for Aspen in a recent report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">August sales were more modest, but the number was still double what it was for that month last year. More than half of the 76 houses and condominiums sold in July, sold for more than $5 million, solidifying Aspen's status as a luxury real-estate hot spot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Covid-19 cases haven't significantly risen with Aspen's new arrivals, even though ski resorts were considered superspreader sites early in the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephane De Baets, co-owner of the Aspen St. Regis Resort, bought a home in a ranchland gated community, moving here from New York City after the pandemic broke out. He declined to say what he paid but said that Aspen was "a very beautiful place where people are very respectful of each other, where the taxes are fairly low and where you have a business type of mentality."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aspen real-estate agents say they are unsure how many pandemic buyers plan to make their move permanent. Even ski buffs might be disappointed by what is expected to be less traffic allowed on the lifts this ski season to comply with social distancing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But local businesses are already adjusting to the influx, and some smell opportunity. AspenJet, a new charter air service, said it plans next year to start offering direct flights between Aspen and New York; Los Angeles; Chicago; Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and other cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Smith, a money manager and owner of semiprivate plane company Wildcat Touring, said his summer-only service connecting Aspen to Dallas and Houston is having its best-ever year. He owns a home in Aspen and said he is considering expanding into fall or winter service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everyone's fleeing the cities to get some clean air," Mr. Smith said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Austin Curry, a law-firm partner in Dallas, came for the cooler climate. "The thing about Dallas is, it is so unbearably hot," he said. "You step outside, and mosquitoes just swarm you."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his family have been renting but would like to buy. It has been tough to find the right place because properties are selling so quickly. He hopes to split his time between Dallas and Aspen, where his children will do remote learning through their Dallas school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many other new residents are trying to enroll locally. The Aspen School District received 150 new enrollment requests in August, five times more than this town of about 7,400 would see in a typical year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the town's core neighborhoods, such as the West End and Smuggler, Aspen's municipal government has encouraged a pattern of dense development that blends old with new.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eight-hundred square-foot Victorian cottages on lots that once housed miners now sell for several million dollars[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-millionaires-living-in-the-mining-cabins-1541091611]. Buyers sometimes spend millions more to build modern attachments, often adding large basements. The ability to build below ground level is especially attractive to pandemic buyers, many of whom are looking for extra space to work from home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Mountain contemporary" architecture, which borrowed from the craftsman lodges of the past, once dominated Aspen's luxury real-estate market. Now, much of the new construction on Aspen's Red Mountain—sometimes called Billionaire Mountain—favors a style more at home in Beverly Hills, some say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Anything that's rectangular, flat-roof…anything that's contemporary and new, or like new, goes," said local broker Tim Estin.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jared Council </div><div>936 words</div><div>2 October 2020</div><div>05:30</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dallas Housing Authority's efforts to distribute Covid-19 housing assistance to the city's renters were bolstered by a sales software system reconfigured with features that enabled officials to grant aid more quickly and equitably.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The governmental agency, sponsored by the <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, in August was tasked with distributing $4 million to income-eligible renters before Dec. 31 as part of the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To meet the deadline and ensure the funds would reach the neediest families, DHA staffers customized an existing software program from <span class="companylink">Zoho Corp</span>. to automate tasks and map the most economically vulnerable neighborhoods in the city. <span class="companylink">Zoho</span>'s customer relationship-management software is primarily intended for sales teams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we can leverage technology to move faster but also move with intention, that was really the spirit of what I tried to accomplish here," said Dr. Myriam Igoufe, vice president of policy development and research at DHA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The automated system her team built went live in late August and started approving checks to landlords last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early results are encouraging, she said. Staff now have a better understanding of who is applying and from what sections of the city, an important distinction that enables officials to better sense whether the money allocated to one district may run out and adjust plans if needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Approximately 1,525 people applied for rent relief funds through DHA, with 388 approved to have checks sent to their landlords in the coming weeks. Sixty-three percent of those accepted applicants came from neighborhoods above the 80th percentile in terms of being the most vulnerable. Without the system they have created, Dr. Igoufe said, distribution wouldn't have been as targeted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This to me means that we are providing much-needed relief to the most vulnerable people in our city," she said. "A lot of people are months and months behind on their rent, and it's not a character flaw. It's Covid."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dallas resident Keia Johnson, 27, is on track to have her $1,065 rent covered for two months through the program. Ms. Johnson said she has been unemployed since March—after losing jobs as a dental coordinator and a beauty salon receptionist—and has been cutting costs and borrowing money just to keep up with her rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Unemployment benefits can only do so much. It's just been a strain. And then, filling out that [DHA] application and seeing them say 'Congratulations, we're paying for it,' has been a relief off my back," Ms. Johnson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DHA started using <span class="companylink">Zoho</span> about two years ago to better keep track of families applying for federal housing vouchers. Although <span class="companylink">Zoho</span> allows for some customization, Dr. Igoufe said her team took things a step further, including writing new code, to make it useful for managing rental assistance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, they had to figure out which neighborhoods were likely to be the most vulnerable, or had the most families with the highest risk of eviction. They referenced a socioeconomic ranking method from the <span class="companylink">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</span>, which is based on factors such as income level and household size. By ranking the neighborhoods by vulnerability, they could allocate funds proportionally, so that residents of the poorest districts could have access to more funds than districts that were comparably well-off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were then able to take that ranking data and overlay it on a map that could communicate with <span class="companylink">Zoho</span> software. For instance, if a renter plugged in a certain address during the application process, the software would know how much money was allocated to that district and whether a lottery was needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's live geocoding in our software that allow us to channel applicants based on their district so they can access their respective pool of funding," Dr. Igoufe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the other work dealt with designing workflows and algorithms, including one that enabled <span class="companylink">Zoho</span> to communicate with a third-party mapping application, Mapsly, which can integrate with <span class="companylink">Zoho</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is rare for housing authorities to have in-house talent that can re-engineer existing software, said Adrianne Todman, chief executive at the National <span class="companylink">Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials</span>. "Usually they would hire consultants or a company that can deliver them something off the shelf, or at least come and tinker with the system they have."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Igoufe, who has a doctorate in urban planning and public policy, joined DHA in 2018. She has expertise in geospatial analysis and poverty research, which involves managing large data sets. Her other two team members are Will Sanders, who has software development and machine learning expertise, and Maggie Deichert, who has a doctorate in political science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Igoufe said she created dozens of workflow rules, including customizing the actions that trigger email notifications to DHA staff members or landlords during the renter application process. Without this automation, she said, staffers likely would have to use spreadsheets to keep track of where an application stands and what next steps are needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're just three goofballs, trying to do something different," Dr. Igoufe said. "It's not sexy to look into equity in housing policy. But when you have messages from people saying, 'God bless you. This is much-needed. I can't believe it,' it really energizes you."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rob Turner is a big skier. But it wasn't skiing that pushed him to make an all-cash, $1.3 million offer on a three-bedroom, four-bathroom, penthouse condo with ski-run views in Park City, Utah, in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impetus to buy this summer was the town's quality of life—a welcome respite from his home in San Francisco, where the pandemic and recent wildfires have made it unpleasant to go outside. Mr. Turner isn't the least bit worried that coronavirus-related restrictions will limit skiing in Park City this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a ski mountain, but it's also a beautiful place," says Mr. Turner, 45, a wealth management adviser. "There are other things to do there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, ski resorts have worked on diversifying their attractions to bring in more people by adding all kinds of non-ski amenities. The test is this coming season, when some might not even be able to open their skiing operations. The early results are looking good, as home sales and prices have soared despite the uncertainty. </p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This was the busiest summer selling season ever," says Ben Fisher, a broker with Summit Sotheby's International Realty in Park City. The high end there has been particularly strong, with sales of single-family homes over $2 million up 50% between March and August 2020 compared with the same period a year earlier, according to Park City MLS. One house sold for all cash and $350,000 over its $15 million list price just a few days after it went on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Colorado, Telluride saw the dollar volume of home sales increase 54% through the month of August compared with a year earlier, with $125 million in sales in August alone—a one-month record, according to George Harvey, broker and owner with The Harvey Team. Aspen recorded 65 single-family home sales through August this year, up from 50 for the same period in 2019, while the dollar value of the sales were up by 49%, according to <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>. Since March 1, 46 houses over $10 million have sold and 24 are under contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've never seen anything like it. The high end is flying off the shelf," says David Viehman, a broker with Engel &amp; Völkers in Jackson Hole, where the total number of sales over $3 million is up 55% over a year earlier and there have been 21 sales over $10 million compared with five sales in that bracket in 2019, a 320% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Share Your Thoughts</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Has the pandemic made you consider buying a vacation home, be it in a resort town or somewhere else?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skiing was initially the reason Keith Seigerman started looking for a second home in Aspen three years ago, but the pandemic played a role in why he finally closed on a four-bedroom, 3,200-square-foot home on 3 acres, 7 miles from the center of town, for $2 million this summer. He likes that Aspen is hard to get to, with limited direct flights, and that it has a remote feel. He also appreciates how strictly the town has been enforcing social-distancing rules, a feat he feels is easier there because of the small size of the community. "It's tucked away, quiet, peaceful and safe," says the 61-year-old contractor from Southampton, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Covid accelerated our decision," says Carter Westfall, who, with his wife, Kate West, bought a three-bedroom, 2,550-square-foot house in Wilson, Wyo., near the Jackson Hole ski area, for $1.75 million in August. The couple had been thinking about relocating from Oakland, Calif., ever since Mr. Westfall started a freeride snowboard competition tour with Travis Rice, a renowned Jackson professional snowboarder. But Mr. Westfall and Ms. West, a creative producer for The North Face, probably would have waited another year to buy if they hadn't noticed that Covid-19 pandemic was increasing demand for houses there, pushing prices higher. At the same time, they worried people wanting to leave the Bay Area because of the city's limits during the coronavirus crisis would lower the price they could get for their house in Oakland, which they have since sold. Mr. Westfall is aware there will be changes at the Jackson Hole ski resort this year, but says they are there for the long haul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People fleeing cities in search of homes with more of a connection to the outdoors are driving much of the demand, real-estate agents say. What started as requests for long-term rentals in April accelerated into sales starting in June, says Kristen Barber, a broker with Stein Eriksen Realty in Park City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This summer, Michelle and Roland Weedon bought a two-bedroom, 1,300-square-foot condo at the Pendry Residences, a residential community still under construction in Park City. The Weedons, who live in Huntington Beach, Calif., where he owns a mortgage company and she is a real-estate consultant, already own a 6,000-square-foot house in Park City that they built three years ago and which is valued at around $5 million. But they thought lots of people would want to get away to wide open spaces and bought the condo as an investment. They are also eager to use the condo's on-site amenities, including the pool and bar, spa, fitness center, ski concierge and slope-side parking. "People are looking to get out," says Mr. Weedon. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the pandemic hit, Claire Nathel second-guessed her decision to buy a 4,000-square-foot penthouse in Deer Valley, Utah, for around $3.5 million. She and her husband, Ira Nathel, had put down a deposit in January but started to falter in May. "We felt like it wasn't the right time, with people losing jobs," says Ms. Nathel, 48, who owns a wholesale produce company in the Bronx. She also felt uncertain about how the pandemic would affect travel and skiing. But she went ahead with the purchase because the closed-in feeling she had in New York made her grateful for a space to go. She and her husband hope to spend a couple of months a year in Utah when their home is finished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Feldman, a broker with the Gary Feldman Group at Aspen Snowmass Sotheby's, says one difference he noticed this summer was that buyers didn't care as much how close they were to the ski mountains. He sold his own three-bedroom, four-bathroom, glass-and-wood house along the Roaring Fork River near Snowmass for $4.8 million and is moving about 7 miles away to Basalt, where he says buyers are now "coming from everywhere."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keith Orr, who bought Mr. Feldman's house, also saw the pandemic as an opportunity: It made it easier to sell his 2,100-square-foot, three-bedroom ski condo in the center of Aspen. Mr. Orr, 58, a car salesman from Dallas and Texarkana, said it took 10 days to sell the condo for $5.3 million—he paid $3.2 million for it seven years ago. He said there were dozens of showings scheduled for his condo after two days on the market. "I've never experienced such a thing," he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stuff Your Broker Didn't Tell You About Mountain Life</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to your new year-round mountain home, flatlanders! You're excited to leave the city behind and embark on your new permanent mountain vacation. Here's what to expect when living full-time among the peaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surviving Winter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* You visited for a couple of weeks each year to ski, so you probably don't know this: Winter—serious, blizzard-having, school-canceling, live-animals-freezing-solid, Donner-Party winter—starts on Halloween and ends on Memorial Day. It's fun at first. Then it's not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Chances are very high that your Escalade's windshield will get cracked by mid-December. Most mountain communities use chunks of gravel instead of salt to grit icy roads. Don't bother getting it repaired. It's a badge of honor that marks you as a local. The cowboy hat will give you away, though.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Snowplow drivers don't care. Your Expedition will not be able to get over the 14-foot-high snow drift they leave at the end of your driveway. Your snowblower will be useless. Pace yourself while shoveling it and try not to fall off the top. Don't dump the snow back in the street. This just makes the plow drivers angry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Snow drifts are beautiful until they block your furnace exhaust pipe. Don't be that (potentially dead) guy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Assume all water, dark patches, or suspicious shadows on the road are black ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* "Mud season" is mid-March through mid-May and is the reason many people don't make it through a full year of mountain living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avoiding Nature</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* All that nature you craved as a city-dweller will eat you if given the chance, especially the mountain lions. You don't need to go looking for it: Nature will visit you in your backyard, and, if you leave a door unlocked, your kitchen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* At night, those reflective round circles by the side of the road are the eyes of elk, moose, buffalo or mule deer waiting to leap into your vehicle's path. When you see an "animal crossing" sign on the road, believe it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Breathing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* At 7,000 feet, the air has 16% effective oxygen content, compared with 21% at sea level, which makes your new home great for developing aerobic fitness—eventually. But first, you'll have a couple months when you'll have to stop halfway through chewing a piece of steak to catch your breath.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Due to the extremely low humidity, your skin will visibly age five years for every year you live in the mountains. Even your eyeballs will dry out. Drink more water than you thought possible. Invest in effective skin care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* On the plus side, your hair will dry very quickly when you get out of the shower, and mildewed towels and stale crackers will be a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Lack of oxygen means the sun is incredibly strong. You'll sunburn in the time it takes to walk from your estate to your mailbox. Wear sunscreen all the time. Even at night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Running Errands</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Here, there is no "popping out" to the hardware store. Everything you want to do is at least an hour's drive away and involves traversing at least one mountain pass or major river crossing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Roads are frequently and suddenly closed for landslides, blizzards, washed-out bridges, avalanches, migrating herds of elk and really bad car accidents (see black ice/animals, above), so always have a Plan B route home. Plan B may involve a kayak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Keep tire chains in the car, even in summer. Pack your trunk like you might spend the night, possibly two, in your vehicle. You eventually will.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth began accelerating in July, a sign that the slow down in home prices caused by the coronavirus pandemic may be reversing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 4.8% in the year ending in July. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.8 percentage points[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-home-price-growth-held-steady-in-june-11598361910] from June to July, after staying flat during the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, sales of existing homes have surged, rising 10.5% on an annual basis in August[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-continued-to-climb-in-august-11600784199], according to the National Association of Realtors. That included a 44% increase in the sales of homes costing more than $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales during the pandemic have been boosted by more families deciding to buy single-family homes where they can more comfortably work from home and have their children do remote learning. Their purchases have been aided by historically low mortgage interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With buyer demand showing no signs of a slow down, as well as limited inventory, more price increases are inevitably on the horizon," said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. <span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, parent of The Wall Street Journal, operates Realtor.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller 10-city index gained 3.3% over the year ended in July, compared with a 2.8% annual increase in June. The 20-city index rose 3.9%, after an annual gain of 3.5% in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle, Phoenix and Charlotte posted the highest price gains of all major U.S. cities. "Prices were particularly strong in the Southeast and West regions, and comparatively weak in the Midwest and Northeast," said Craig Lazzara, a managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate measure of home sales price growth by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> found that prices rose 1.0% in July from June and rose 6.5% on an annual basis.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales rose in August for the third consecutive month, fueled by robust demand for luxury homes and a pickup in Northeast sales that kept the housing market hot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes rose 2.4% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of six million, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday. That built on a 24.7% surge in July home sales, which was the strongest monthly gain ever recorded, going back to 1968.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers have returned in force since late spring, when lockdowns related to the coronavirus pandemic eased, open houses resumed and ultralow mortgage rates helped spur sales. With many Americans working from home, buyers are seeking more space and accelerating plans to leave cities for the suburbs or for more rural areas, real-estate agents say. Other home buyers have moved to live closer to family members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists and housing experts expect sales to stay strong through the end of the year. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> has signaled it expects to hold rates near zero for at least three more years, and mortgage rates are also expected to stay low. Many companies have indicated that large numbers of Americans will continue working from home even after a coronavirus vaccine is developed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sales volume could begin to taper in late 2020, but given current conditions, it's unlikely to diminish too much," said Matthew Speakman, economist at Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On an annual basis, sales rose 10.5% in August, putting this summer's housing market well ahead of last year's sales levels. The boom in sales was most pronounced at the upper end of the market. Sales of homes priced at more than $1 million rose 44% nationally and were up 63.1% in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The luxury housing sector is just simply taking off," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist of NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were strongest in the Northeast during August, increasing 13.8%. That was followed by the Midwest, where total sales rose just 1.4%. The pickup in parts of the Northeast reflected pent-up buyer demand after pandemic-related restrictions began easing in some markets.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pandemic has aggravated the housing market's longstanding lack of supply, creating a historic shortage of homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers are accelerating purchase plans or considering homeownership for the first time, rushing to get more living space as many Americans anticipate working from home for a while. Many potential sellers, meanwhile, are keeping their homes off the market for pandemic-related reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combined effect has created an extreme drought of previously owned homes for sale. At the end of July, there were 1.3 million single-family existing homes for sale, the lowest count for any July in data going back to 1982, according to the National Association of Realtors. In the week ended Sept. 12, total for-sale inventory was down 29.4% from a year earlier at the lowest level since at least late 2017, <span class="companylink">Zillow Group</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shortage has pushed home prices higher, stretching the budgets of many middle-class and first-time home buyers. The median existing-home price crossed above $300,000 for the first time ever in July, up 8.5% from a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>. Existing home sales and inventory figures for August come out on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rapidly rising house prices are effectively canceling out the increased purchasing power that buyers are getting from lower interest rates, brokerage <span class="companylink">Redfin Corp</span>. said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. has had a shortage of housing for years. New-home construction dropped sharply during the 2007-09 recession and has still not recovered to precrisis levels. Homeowners have also been staying in their homes longer than they used to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the pandemic, the problem has worsened. At the July sales pace, there were 3.1 months of total existing-home inventory left in the market at the end of the month, down from 3.9 months in June and 4.2 months in July 2019, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shortage of existing homes has been a boost to the home-building sector, which has posted strong sales gains. Single-family housing starts, a measure of U.S. home building, rose 4.1% in August from July to the highest seasonally adjusted annual rate since February, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would-be home sellers have numerous reasons for staying out of the market, real-estate agents say. Some are worried about potential virus exposure by letting strangers tour their homes. Others have canceled or delayed their plans to move due to the pandemic, or they are worried about finding a new home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KC Hart has experienced the inventory shortage firsthand as a real-estate broker in Missoula, Mont., where demand is high from buyers moving from other states. He has also contributed to the problem. Mr. Hart and his wife were planning to sell their house this summer after their youngest went to college, but they delayed their move because their son is staying at home this fall while taking classes locally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's one more house not on the market," Mr. Hart said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, sellers are waiting until the spring, traditionally the busiest home-selling season, said Quentin Dane, chief executive of Dash Realty Group in Raleigh, N.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We hear this all the time: 'They might get a vaccine for Covid coming at the end of the year, and the spring market is right around the corner,'" Mr. Dane said. "Sellers [are] saying, 'If I don't need to sell, why go through the risk of selling right now?'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff and Jill Borgida wanted to sell their house in Bothell, Wash., this spring now that their children were grown. But with inventory so low, they struggled to find a new house in their area and budget that met their needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were getting nervous, because we were along a path to list our house and we're not finding any really suitable options," Mr. Borgida said. Finally, they widened their search parameters and found a house farther out than they had originally looked.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultralow interest rates are drawing buyers into the market, but they are also offering potential sellers another incentive to stay put. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 2.87% last week, holding near record lows, said mortgage-finance giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Refinancings in the second quarter rose more than 200%[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/mortgage-refinancings-boom-even-as-coronavirus-hits-economy-11599557401] from a year earlier, according to mortgage-data firm <span class="companylink">Black Knight Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other homeowners could be holding off for fear of not qualifying for a new mortgage due to a change in employment or income. About 7% of mortgage loans were in forbearance in the week ended Sept. 6, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another obstacle for sellers is the high demand for contractors, painters and other workers who can perform repairs or upgrades to houses to prepare them for sale, said Beth Traverso, managing broker at Re/Max Northwest Realtors.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy's uneven recovery amid the coronavirus pandemic is helping lift consumer moods from weak levels, as inflation expectations tick higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</span> said Monday that its Survey of Consumer Expectations[https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce] for August showed "a continued decline in pessimism about households' financial situation." The report added, "[I]n particular, home price growth expectations returned to levels close to a year ago, while delinquency expectations remain low."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the release, the bank found that survey respondents see higher inflation at both the one- and three-year-ahead horizons. Expectations of higher prices next year rose by 0.1% to 3% and by 0.3% to 3% for inflation three years from now. The bank said higher inflation expectations were driven by the views of people over the age of 40, and it noted there was a lot of disagreement about the outlook for prices in the survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report arrives after the Fed announced at the end of August that it would allow inflation to go over 2% to make up for shortfalls. The Fed has failed to consistently hit its 2% goal since adopting it in 2012, and it hopes the new strategy, which also seeks to run the job market hotter than in the past, will help it get price pressures back to desired levels, in part by helping shore up the public's outlook for price pressures, which has shown weakness lately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actual readings of inflation have been decidedly low recently and are expected to stay that way due to the problems the economy is facing while navigating the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expectations of higher home price changes come as many markets in the U.S. have seen strong housing sales. The <span class="companylink">New York Fed</span> said expected house price increases were broad based, and survey respondents foresee a 2.8% gain in August, a clear recovery from the flat reading reported in the survey back in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, respondents offered mixed views on personal finances and the job market. They reported low income growth expectations and a perception credit is hard to get. Job worries were concentrated in lower income workers, who have borne the brunt of job losses in the current crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the report said, "perceptions about households' current financial situations compared to a year ago improved slightly, with more respondents reporting being better off." It also said "one-year ahead expectations about households' financial situations also improved with more respondents expecting their financial situation to improve."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Orla McCaffrey </div><div>808 words</div><div>9 September 2020</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage market recorded its best quarter in years this spring, a reflection of how the housing market is booming in 2020 even as much of the economy stumbles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders issued $1.1 trillion in home loans between April and June, according to mortgage-data firm <span class="companylink">Black Knight Inc</span>. That was the biggest quarter in the company's records, which date to 2000. Lenders extended roughly $2.5 trillion in home loans in all of 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Refinancings, up more than 200% from a year ago, drove the increase. Mortgage rates hit new lows multiple times this year, falling below 3% for the first time in July. The low rates have made millions more Americans eligible to save money on their monthly payments. Purchase mortgages, though, fell 8% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dena and Patrick Driscoll closed on their refinance in April, trading in their <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> loan for a conventional one. That got them a rate of about 3%, more than 1 percentage point lower than their previous one, and they no longer had to pay <span class="companylink">FHA</span> mortgage insurance. That slashed the monthly payment on their Philadelphia home from about $2,000 to roughly $1,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Driscolls, who have kept their jobs during the coronavirus pandemic, are using some of the difference to cover the cost of activities for their two elementary-school children, who just started a fully remote learning program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The money "gives us a little extra cushion, but it gets eaten up by having to pay for these extra things -- making sure they have care at times when I can't provide it," Mrs. Driscoll said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage market's response to the pandemic is the latest in a series of seemingly opposing indicators of Americans' financial health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many renters are worried about getting evicted after losing jobs or taking pay cuts. Many out-of-work homeowners are staying afloat for now -- but only because lenders are letting them temporarily skip mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, many wealthier Americans with steady jobs, stuck at home with fewer places to spend money, are faring well. The pandemic and record-low rates have nudged many of them to buy second homes in more-rural areas or to shop for houses with more space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales jumped almost 25% in July, the strongest monthly gain on record. Home prices have continued to rise even during the pandemic, pushing homeownership further out of reach for many Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This boom in mortgage originations isn't necessarily going to be that awesome for the broader economy," said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at Haus, a home-finance startup. "There is less of a multiplier effect in the economy when somebody refinances versus buying a house."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, the catalyst for low rates, a limp U.S. economy, is the same force that has caused millions of Americans to lose jobs or even go hungry. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>, worried about the economy's fallout, cut interest rates to near zero earlier this year and said it would buy an essentially unlimited amount of mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nervous investors are also driving the low mortgage rates. Mortgage rates tend to move in the same direction as the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. Yields fall when anxious investors clamor for safe-haven assets like Treasury bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage market had been on a tear before the pandemic. Originations last year reached their highest level since 2006, according to industry research group Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, early this spring, home sales fell sharply as the pandemic pummeled the U.S. Many would-be buyers were too uncertain about their job prospects to commit to buying a home, and stay-at-home orders prevented some real-estate agents from showing homes in person.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon after, though, many mortgage lenders were overwhelmed by a deluge of refinance and purchase applications from those with the means to take advantage of low rates. Many lenders have since increased capacity, expecting the lending boom to last until at least the end of the year. Mortgage lender Draper &amp; Kramer Mortgage Corp. has expanded its staff, said Matt Patterson, executive vice president of business development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has remained one of the most resilient sectors of the economy through the pandemic, positioning itself to play an important role in an eventual recovery. But that isn't likely to happen soon, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lance and Jennifer Haun closed on their Vancouver, Wash., home in May, locking in a rate of 3.125%. They had rented in the area for about a year after moving from the San Francisco area. Low rates helped persuade them to put down an offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was the perfect time to pull the trigger," said Mr. Haun, a marketing consultant.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A surge in homebuying demand and limited inventory for existing homes is spurring construction to help fill the gap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders attribute their robust sales to low interest rates, a shortage of existing homes for sale and consumer willingness to move farther from city centers in exchange for more space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New single-family-home sales rose 13.9% in July from June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 901,000, the highest level since December 2006, according to the Commerce Department. Single-family housing starts, a measure of U.S. home building, rose 8.2% in July from June to the highest seasonally adjusted annual rate since February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The demand feels really good right now," said Martin Connor, chief financial officer of Toll Brothers Inc. "The longer it goes, the more comfortable we are that it's got longer legs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strength in the home-building sector underscores the uneven nature of the economic recession, which has hit low-wage workers especially hard. While millions of workers have lost their jobs, those who are still employed have saved more money due to the pandemic and can take advantage of record-low mortgage interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders' positive outlook is a sharp turnaround from early spring, when coronavirus lockdowns forced construction sites to halt in some parts of the country and builders swiftly cut spending on land acquisitions and new projects. U.S. home-builder confidence rose in August to match the record high last reached in 1998, up from an eight-year low in April, according to the National <span class="companylink">Association of Home Builders</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P Homebuilders Select Industry Index is up 17.89% this year as of Tuesday, exceeding the 9.16% rise in the S&amp;P 500 over the same period, according to FactSet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders also are benefiting from demographic changes, as younger millennials are entering their early 30s and accounting for a growing portion of home sales. Booming demand also has pushed sales of previously owned homes to multiyear highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing demand has outpaced supply for years, but the housing shortage has become even more acute in the existing-home market in recent months as the pandemic has made some sellers reluctant to list their homes. At the current sales pace, there were 3.1 months of existing homes available for sale at the end of July, according to the National Association of Realtors. In comparison, the new-home market had 4.0 months' supply available at the end of July, according to the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Stephanie and Sven Christensen moved to Grand Haven, Mich., this year for Mr. Christensen's job, they couldn't find anything on the market that fit their needs. They decided to build a new house instead. "We're super, super excited," Ms. Christensen said. But "we would have much preferred to find a house that would work for us that we could just buy and move into."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to the strong demand, home builders are raising prices. The median sales price of a new house sold in July was $330,600, up 7.2% from a year earlier.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nicole Friedman </div><div>1098 words</div><div>27 August 2020</div><div>05:30</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millennials, long viewed as perennial home renters who were reluctant or unable to buy, are now emerging as a driving force in the U.S. housing market's recent recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand from millennials, who today range from their mid-20s to late 30s, has been increasingly important to the housing market since at least the middle of the last decade. But more recently, these new homeowners have been pushing aside older generations to become an even bigger influence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millennials reached a housing milestone early last year when the group first accounted for more than half of all new home loans, and they consistently held above that level in the first months of this year, the most recent period for which data are available, according to Realtor.com. The generation made up 38% of home buyers in the year that ended July 2019, up from 32% in 2015, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group last year also surpassed baby boomers as the biggest living adult generation in the U.S., according to the <span class="companylink">Pew Research Center</span>. The largest cohort of millennial births was in 1990, Pew said, meaning that group turns 30 sometime this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We anticipate as they turn 31 and 32, we'll just see homebuying demand grow," said Odeta Kushi, deputy chief economist at First American Financial Corp. Millennials could be responsible for at least 15 million home sales in the next decade, the firm said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising millennial homeownership challenges years of speculation after the 2007-09 recession that millennials would be stuck renting perpetually[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/financial-crisis-yields-a-generation-of-renters-11564228800], hampered by student-loan debt and wary of the housing market[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-recession-left-millennials-loaded-with-debtand-cynical-11583956727] after the foreclosure crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That raised questions about how millennials would build nest eggs, because homeownership has commonly been viewed as a pillar of wealth creation. Now, brokers and economists say millennials' homebuying interest was simply delayed.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That growing demand is compounded by younger millennials, who are now entering their 30s and starting to buy homes more actively. That is more in line with the ages at which many baby boomers and Generation X, the group born before millennials, began buying homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Millennials, they're roaring into homebuying age," said Rick Arvielo, chief executive of mortgage lender New American Funding. "What the industry's been talking about for a decade is whether they're going to follow their predecessor generations in terms of their desire to own homes," he said, adding, "Yeah, they do—they have the same desires."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Younger buyers were a big reason why home sales continued on the path to recovery in July. Sales of previously owned homes surged almost 25% in July[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-rose-24-7-in-july-from-june-11598018897] to their highest seasonally adjusted annual rate since December 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers accounted for 34% of sales in July, up from 32% a year earlier, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said.</p>

Many millennials have additional motivations, especially parents of young or growing families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sandra Martinez-Gonzalez, who is 32 years old and lives in Las Vegas, used to think she didn't want to own a home. She preferred the freedom to pick up and move. But when she started looking for a new place to rent at the beginning of the year, she realized buying would be cheaper than renting in her neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Martinez-Gonzalez and her husband moved into their first home with their 2-year-old daughter in July. "It feels amazing," she said, citing the bigger space and a home office. "Now that we have a home it kind of feels like: Why didn't we do this sooner?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strong housing market can be a positive sign for the economy, as home purchases can lead to increased spending on furniture, appliances and renovations. Home builders have also expanded activity[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/lumber-futures-price-climbs-to-record-high-as-construction-gains-11596752238] in response to the demand.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those who remain employed, ultralow interest rates offer an additional incentive to buy, as they can reduce monthly payments and make homeownership more affordable.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INCLINE VILLAGE, Nev.—The "aha moment" for Brett Rossmann came when he realized that with everyone at his digital marketing company working from home because of coronavirus, he could just as easily be living in the mountains rather than crowded Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are huge into the outdoors," said the 45-year-old Mr. Rossmann, whose family of four is closing on a sale of a new home here in this Lake Tahoe community. "It's 'win, win, win' on lifestyle."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents of expensive metro areas around the U.S., who can now work remotely and no longer want to deal with urban ills, are fueling real-estate booms in smaller cities and resort areas—particularly in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boom is part of heightened buying activity in less-populated areas across the U.S., all fueled by the same motivation: people seeking more open spaces after being cooped up during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Reno, Nev., real-estate salesman Mike Wood said he is on track to close 31 home sales totaling $14 million this month compared with 18 worth $8 million in August last year—a 75% jump. "We have never been this busy," Mr. Wood said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builder Toll Brothers, too, is seeing unprecedented sales activity at its 16 communities in Reno. "We're seeing more young families come from the Bay Area," said Gary Mayo, a regional group president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Colorado's Vail Valley, Slifer Smith &amp; Frampton Real Estate said that between June 1 and Aug. 20 it wrote 432 home contracts—a 99% increase over the same period last year. In Aspen, meanwhile, home-sale contracts tripled to 76 in July from the same month last year, according to a report by <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of mid-August, Domain Timber Advisors LLC so far this year had sold 62 lots in rural areas outside cities like Seattle, Houston and Jacksonville, Fla., compared with about 25 in the same time last year, said managing director Joe Sanderson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think the main driver is people really wanting to have the option of getting out of the city and live and exist and enjoying a certain lifestyle," Mr. Sanderson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few places have seen as much buying activity as Lake Tahoe, a cobalt blue attraction on the California-Nevada border that has long been a popular getaway for people from major cities in the two states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales, mostly of second homes, were off to a strong start at the beginning of the year, but "fell off a cliff" when the national shutdowns began in March, said Jeff Brown, owner of Tahoe Mountain Realty in Truckee, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But almost as soon as states began reopening in April, the crowds returned—and home sales went through the roof, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June and July, the number of homes sold on the California side of North Lake Tahoe more than doubled to 532 compared with the year-earlier period, according to Tahoe Mountain Realty. On the Nevada side, they shot up to 157 from 71 during the same two months compared with a year ago, according to Coldwell Banker Select Real Estate Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Incline Village, Mr. Rossmann and his wife, Lauren, decided to move after dealing with issues including schools closed indefinitely for their 9-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter at their home in Manhattan Beach, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're basically saying, 'We're out of there'," said Mr. Rossmann, citing other issues including high taxes in Southern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So many out-of-towners have arrived at the same conclusion that bidding wars have broken out. Lake Tahoe's inventory of unsold homes has dropped sharply—to about 60 this month from 421 at the same time a year ago, said Coldwell Banker broker-salesman Trevor Smith.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median prices are rising: On the Nevada side of the north shore, the prices of homes under contract have jumped 43% to $1.26 million as of July from $880,000 at the same time a year ago, according to Coldwell Banker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this has put a squeeze on locals like Andria Gutierrez, who kept losing out to other buyers as she and her fiancé searched for a home over the past summer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple ended up having to spend about $800,000—and write a personal note of appeal to the seller—before finally landing a three-bedroom home nestled in the ponderosa pines above the lake.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ruling Keeps Statue</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Place for Now</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gov. Ralph Northam suffered a setback in his bid to take down a prominent statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee in Richmond as a judge ruled that a lawsuit seeking to block the monument's removal can proceed to trial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richmond Circuit Court Judge W. Reilly Marchant Tuesday denied state officials' motion to throw out the suit, which was brought by several people who live near the 130-year-old statue. The judge set an Oct. 19 trial date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lawyer for the plaintiffs declined to comment. They allege in the suit that removing the statue would violate an 1889 joint resolution of the Virginia legislature, as well as a restrictive covenant created by property deeds from 1887 and 1890.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I will keep fighting to remove this divisive and antiquated relic," said state Attorney General Mark Herring, a Democrat, whose office is defending the governor's attempt to take down the statue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Northam, a Democrat, announced his intention in June to put the state-owned statue in storage, as nationwide protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis prompted a push to sweep away Confederate symbols.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a judge quickly issued a temporary injunction blocking the governor's plan, even as dozens of Confederate statues around the U.S. continued falling, some at the hands of protesters and others on local officials' orders.</p>

<span class="companylink">U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services</span> called off a furlough of more than 13,400 employees that was set to begin Monday, forestalling a cut of more than two-thirds of its staff that would have brought much of the agency's work to a halt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joe Edlow, the agency's deputy director and day-to-day leader, announced the cancellation Tuesday. He said USCIS leadership decided to cancel the furloughs in light of higher-than-expected demand in immigration applications and aggressive spending cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">USCIS, unlike most other federal agencies, funds itself almost entirely through the fees it collects. In May, the agency said it was considering a furlough after citizenship and immigration applications fell precipitously in March and April because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the agency first proposed the furloughs, applications have risen. USCIS projected earlier this month that its revenue would fall 4% short of initial projections for the year ending Sept. 30, rather than the 61% shortfall it predicted in May.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales surged in July, signaling how the pandemic is reshaping where and how Americans want to live during a period of social distancing and working from home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers who were reluctant to venture out in March and April when much of the country was under lockdown have returned in force since late spring. With the effects of coronavirus showing little signs of abating, many home shoppers have new priorities for a place to live, or are accelerating existing plans, brokers and economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers are ready to move farther from cities, now that many workers aren't commuting every day. The pandemic has spurred some households to live closer to family, or somewhere that offers more space with so much time spent at home, according to people in the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People that were in condominiums are looking for townhomes, and people in townhomes are looking for single-families," said Bob Chew, a group leader at Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices PenFed Realty in Ellicott City, Md. "People are at home, and the more time they spend in the home, they realize, 'I want some different features in my home.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The July sales numbers were among the strongest the housing market has ever seen. Sales of previously owned homes jumped 24.7% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.86 million, the National Association of Realtors said Friday. That was the strongest monthly gain ever recorded, going back to 1968. It was also the highest sales pace since December 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates that hovered near all-time lows helped the housing market break out of a long slump heading into 2020. Now, after a sharp decline in the early spring due to the outbreak, pent-up demand is pushing the market even higher. Homes typically go under contract a month or two before closing, so July figures largely reflect purchase decisions made in May or June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market is actually past the recovery phase and is now in a booming stage," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at NAR. "New demand has been created because of the pandemic, with the work-from-home flexibility."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers accounted for 34% of sales in July, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said, a category that includes many millennial buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This group, who range from their mid-20s to their late 30s, are a growing presence in the housing market. Older millennials who delayed getting married and having children are now reaching those milestones, which increases homeownership demand. Younger millennials entering their 30s are starting to buy homes more actively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market offers one of the few signs of strength in the U.S. economy, which has sputtered under the pandemic. Housing starts soared 22.6% in July from June, well above expectations. New-home sales, which make up about 10% of the market, have also roared back this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales can have positive knock-on effects for the economy, as consumers spend more on goods and renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong demand and a shortage of supply pushed the median home price to new highs, which could make houses less affordable for some first-time buyers. The median existing-home price rose 8.5% from a year earlier to $304,100, a record high nominally and adjusted for inflation, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists warn that the recession and high unemployment could damp homebuying interest later on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, buying surveys suggest demand looks strong in the near term.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brittani Baynard and Sam Krueger decided to spend money they'd saved for their wedding to buy a four-bedroom home in Madison, Wis., in June. They had planned to buy a house in the next two years, but the pandemic made them want to move sooner out of their apartment into more space for Ms. Baynard's 8-year-old daughter, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fearing another phase of the pandemic, Ms. Baynard said, "I want us all to be comfortable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Billings, Mont., buyers are coming from as far away as Texas and New York. Some are buying houses without seeing them in person, said Deb Parker, president of the <span class="companylink">Billings Association of Realtors</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with the last time sales were this high, in 2006, lending standards are tighter and the supply of homes for sale is much lower, Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand is so robust that 68% of houses that sold in July were on the market for less than a month, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said. Brokerage Redfin Corp. said more than half its offers in July faced at least one competing bid.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales surged in July, signaling how much the pandemic is reshaping where and how Americans want to live during this period of social distancing and working from home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers who were reluctant to venture out in March and April when much of the country was under lockdown have returned in force since late spring. With the effects of coronavirus showing little signs of abating, many home shoppers have new priorities for a place to live, or are accelerating existing plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers are ready to move farther from cities, now that many workers aren't commuting every day. The pandemic has spurred some households to live closer to family, or somewhere that offers more space with so much time spent at home, brokers and economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People that were in condominiums are looking for townhomes, and people in townhomes are looking for single-families," said Bob Chew, a group leader at Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices PenFed Realty in Ellicott City, Md. "People are at home, and the more time they spend in the home, they realize, 'I want some different features in my home.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The July sales numbers were among the strongest the housing market has ever seen. Sales of previously owned homes jumped 24.7% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.86 million, according to the National Association of Realtors on Friday. That was the strongest monthly gain ever recorded, going back to 1968. It was also the highest sales pace since December 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates that hovered near all-time lows helped the housing market break out of a long slump heading into 2020. Now, after a sharp decline in the early spring due to the coronavirus outbreak, pent-up demand is pushing the market even higher. Homes typically go under contract a month or two before closing, so July figures largely reflect purchase decisions made in May or June.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jinjoo Lee </div><div>556 words</div><div>19 August 2020</div><div>13:11</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-improvement retailers <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> and <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> had a phenomenal quarter, but investors aren't in the mood to savor the gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Home Depot's sales grew 23.4%[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/strong-home-depot-results-show-pandemics-consumer-spending-shift-11597749267]in the quarter ended Aug. 2 from the year-ago period, while Lowe's revenue jumped 30%[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/lowes-online-quarterly-sales-more-than-doubled-11597835418] in the quarter ended July 31. Both companies exceeded analysts' estimated revenue by around 10%. Diluted earnings per share increased 75% year over year at <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> and 26.8% at <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>. Yet shares of <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> are down around 2% since it reported earnings Tuesday morning, and <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> was basically flat after reporting Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As in the preceding quarter[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/economy-could-spoil-home-improvement-party-11589992635], sales to do-it-yourself consumers outpaced those to professional contractors at both retailers. <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> benefited more from this trend as DIY customers make up a higher portion of its business. Interestingly, sales growth was strong in all U.S. regions for both companies and not correlated with the size of Covid-19 outbreaks, which bodes well for the rest of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the concern seems to be around how sustainable their impressive sales can be. Both are mature businesses and it is clear that a lot of the demand growth is specific to the Covid-19 pandemic, when consumers are spending more time at home and spending less on other discretionary categories such as traveling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market-share gains at the expense of smaller competitors, however, seem to have benefited both companies—as larger chains like them were able to keep shelves well-stocked. Lowe's Chief Executive Marvin Ellison said on a Wednesday morning earnings call that it would have been difficult to boost revenue so much without gaining market share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason for the strength in <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> and <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> could be similar to why housing-market indexes have been so resilient[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/home-builders-enjoy-covid-immunity-for-now-11597685729]: Those building new homes or renovating existing ones tend to be in higher income brackets, and therefore less dependent on stimulus. Low mortgage rates also have helped home buyers. Plus, existing housing stock is aging, according to Brian Yarbrough, equity analyst at Edward Jones. He notes that even in downturns, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> and <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> tend to do fine because people need to undertake repairs regardless of the economic situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the two companies, there is little question as to whether demand will hold up the rest of this year. Unless a miracle cure emerges for Covid-19 by year-end, a remote possibility, people will continue to spend more time in their homes and spend more dollars improving them. Of the two, <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> seems to hold more promise as it showed operational strength: Its operating margin expanded by more than 3 percentage points year over year, while <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>'s stayed stagnant. <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> efforts to make its stores more efficient seem to be paying off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> trades at roughly 22 times forward 12-month earnings compared with a five-year average of 18 times, while <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> goes for 24 times, compared with its five-year average of 21, according to S&amp;P Global Intelligence. The companies aren't exactly cheap, but they seem to have more than justified their worth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home sales and prices are juicing the economy, but as we've learned the hard way the housing market bears watching for credit-induced bubbles. The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> (FHFA) is wisely looking out for taxpayers by taking actions to prevent mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> from taking too much risk. But it's running into bipartisan opposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week the FHFA approved a 0.5 percentage-point surcharge on refinanced mortgages purchased by Fannie and Freddie. Record low interest rates this year have led to a surge in mortgage refinancing. Many are taking advantage to reduce monthly payments and take cash from their home equity to spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But refinancing becomes riskier as home prices appreciate relative to incomes. Prices on lower-end homes in May were up 83% since January 2012 and 14% since January 2019. Higher home values allow homeowners to take more cash out and receive lower interest rates even as credit quality and incomes have deteriorated during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also become harder for mortgage originators to assess credit risk because other lenders are marking as current some consumer loans that are in forbearance. Another risk is that home prices in cities like San Francisco and New York City may start to fall as people leave. Homeowners who refinanced could then fall underwater on their mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is why many large banks have tightened underwriting standards on refinanced mortgages they hold, allowing Fannie and Freddie to increase their market share. The housing giants now account for 90% of cash out-refinancings and 80% of other refinancings, up from 75% and 63% respectively in January 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FHFA surcharge will help account for the increased refinance risk though is unlikely to substantially dampen refinance activity. The surcharge would add a mere 13 basis points to the mortgage rate, which has fallen by 70 basis points since December and 185 since a recent high in autumn 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet 20 some housing groups groused last week that "at a time when the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> is purchasing $40 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities per month to help reduce the cost of buying or refinancing a home and stimulate the broader economy, this action by the GSEs raises those costs, contradicting and undermining Fed policy." No subsidy is ever enough for this crowd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The political backlash prompted the Trump Administration to undercut FHFA director Mark Calabria with a statement that "the White House has serious concerns with this action, and is reviewing it." Housing groups and their liberal friends are also demanding that Mr. Calabria extend the public comment period, which is set to close Aug. 31, for a separate rule he's proposed setting tougher capital standards for Fan and Fred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week 10 Democratic Senators led by Elizabeth Warren echoed an earlier letter by 17 housing and finance trade groups that "stakeholders wishing to provide comment on this critical rule will not have the time and attention that they otherwise might give to analyzing and providing insights on the rule" due to the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hello? The 2008 Housing and Economic Recovery Act directed the FHFA to set capital standards to ensure the giants operate in a "safe and sound manner." Obama-era FHFA director Mel Watt finally got around to proposing a rule in 2018, which Mr. Calabria has tinkered with by increasing capital requirements on riskier mortgages. Housing groups and Democrats say this will reduce "affordable housing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that's what they say about all government restraints on the mortgage giants. The capital standards for Fannie and Freddie would still be lower than for the big banks. The housing lobby wants to run out the clock on Mr. Calabria and is betting that a new director under Joe Biden will let Fannie and Freddie run wild again. Taxpayers, be warned.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Suburban Home Prices Are Rising. But So Are Most Urban Home Prices; Median urban home prices were flat from a year earlier, dragged down by weak demand in San Francisco and Manhattan</span>
</div><div class="author">By Nicole Friedman </div><div>753 words</div><div>13 August 2020</div><div>11:09</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suburban housing markets have been on a tear since the pandemic, as home buyers have sought more space. But a new analysis shows home sales in most urban markets are doing nearly as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new analysis challenges the prevailing wisdom that city homeowners have been selling homes since the start of the pandemic to move to suburban houses with outdoor space, home offices and more square footage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median suburban home prices at the end of June were up 3.3% year over year, according to a new analysis by <span class="companylink">Zillow Group Inc</span>. Median urban home prices at the end of June were flat from a year earlier, Zillow said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home values in the urban ZIP Codes tracked by Zillow were dragged down in part by San Francisco and Manhattan where demand has been relatively weak. June prices also largely reflect properties that went under contract in May, when some of the country's biggest cities were under lockdowns. In the Midwest, urban and suburban ZIP Codes showed little difference in price growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow's Home Value Index, which estimates price changes for all houses in an area, not just the ones that recently sold, rose more than 4% in June from a year earlier for both urban and suburban ZIP Codes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers are eagerly shopping in cities and suburbs, spurred by low interest rates, said Jeff Tucker, an economist at Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Demand in the suburbs is strong because demand is strong almost everywhere," Mr. Tucker said. "For every urbanite who's fed up with the city and selling their condo right now to move to the suburbs, I'm hearing from two or three people who are renting nearby and saying, 'Awesome, I'll take your condo.' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lack of homes for sale is a big reason why home prices have continued to rise despite high unemployment. Nationally, the inventory of homes on the market as of Aug. 8 was down 36% from a year earlier, according to Realtor.com. (<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, parent of The Wall Street Journal, operates Realtor.com.) Record-low interest rates have boosted demand, but some sellers are holding off on listing their houses until the pandemic ends, brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in Manhattan and San Francisco, where demand has remained soft, an excess of housing supply came on the market as lockdowns eased and agents could show homes more readily. New listings in Manhattan rose 87% in July compared with a year earlier, according to listing site StreetEasy, which is owned by Zillow. San Francisco inventory nearly doubled from a year earlier on Aug. 1, Zillow said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are also the two most expensive housing markets, leaving them more vulnerable to price adjustments on the downside. The median sales price in Manhattan plunged 39.6% in June from a year earlier, before rebounding in July, according to StreetEasy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family existing home sale prices in San Francisco fell 4.1% from a year earlier in May, according to the <span class="companylink">California Association of Realtors</span>. But these prices also bounced back a bit, rising 2.4% in June from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The surrounding areas have really taken off and become far more competitive," as home shoppers seek more space, said Justin Fichelson, a San Francisco real-estate agent. Still, he said, "I don't really see an abnormal amount of people selling to leave the city."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median sales price data can be volatile, especially when the number of sales drops as it did this spring due to the pandemic. Median prices can also reflect changes in the mix of high-price and low-price homes being sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow also said its search data doesn't show a change in urban and suburban demand compared with last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New figures released from the National Association of Realtors on Wednesday show how widespread demand for housing has been.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median single-family home prices rose year over year in almost every metro area in the country in the second quarter. The national median price for an existing single-family home was $291,300 in the second quarter, up 4.2% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the strongest markets were inland cities, including Huntsville, Ala., where median home prices rose 13.5% from a year earlier, and Memphis, Tenn., where prices rose 13.4%, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Karen Langley </div><div>396 words</div><div>11 August 2020</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of home builders have been on a tear since the stock market bottomed in late March,boosted by a recovery in the housing market as record-low mortgage rates draw buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P 500's home-building subindustry index -- made up of <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">NVR Inc</span>. -- is up 23% this year and closed Monday at its first record in 15 years. The S&amp;P 500, in comparison, has risen 4% and is within 1% of its February high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has picked up after health and economic fears tied to the coronavirus pandemic sent sales plunging earlier this year. Sales of new single-family homes increased sharply in June from the prior month, according to the Commerce Department, beating economists' expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big factor supporting demand: Mortgage rates have tumbled. In July, the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage fell to 2.98%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, its lowest level in nearly 50 years of record-keeping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carl Reichardt, home-building analyst at BTIG, said factors contributing to the home-builder rally include low interest rates and limited inventory of homes, as well as the "idea of home as a fortress, a safety net from Covid, as well as a place of work for some people."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A surge in construction also helped push lumber futures to a record last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On an earnings call last month, PulteGroup Chief Executive Ryan Marshall said recovery in demand for new homes during the second quarter "was nothing short of outstanding." Year-over-year orders increased 50% for the month of June, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-building index last closed at a record in July 2005, according to Dow Jones Market Data. It has more than doubled from its 2020 low in late March. Shares of <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> and <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> have surged more than 30% this year, while Pulte is up 16% and <span class="companylink">NVR</span> has risen 2.7%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builder stocks could continue to see gains, analysts say, if interest rates stay low and consumers continue to prioritize their homes, particularly in a recovering job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think the momentum behind them is pretty strong," Mr. Reichardt said. "I expect them to continue to perform well on a relative basis."</p>

Diageo's Growth Cocktail Is Weak Outside the U.S. Thanks to drinkers at home, sales in North America were almost flat in the liquor giant's pandemic-hit second half</span>
</div><div class="author">By Carol Ryan </div><div>511 words</div><div>4 August 2020</div><div>09:03</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a pity for <span class="companylink">Diageo</span> that America's exceptional drinking habits can't be exported. Returning to growth in other parts of the world will be a fraught process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The London-based maker of Johnnie Walker scotch and Guinness stout said Tuesday that sales in North America fell just 1%[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/diageos-alcohol-sales-rise-in-north-america-but-fall-elsewhere-as-covid-19-weighs-11596528177] over the six months through June compared with the same period of 2019. Far tougher conditions everywhere else dragged group sales down 23% overall. Management sounded cautious about how quickly demand will recover—one reason the company's shares fell 6% in early European trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North America, which accounts for 39% of <span class="companylink">Diageo</span>'s revenue, has been one of the most resilient liquor markets[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/a-global-downturn-will-test-investors-taste-for-liquor-11585338112] in the world since the Covid-19 pandemic began. Americans like to drink at home anyway: Even in normal times, only a fifth of all the liquor consumed in the U.S. happens in bars or restaurants, brokerage Bernstein estimates. And the bulk of sales lost in these venues during lockdowns shifted to supermarkets. Consumers spent 38% more on spirits to drink in their homes in the 17 weeks to mid-July than a year ago, according to Nielsen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other important markets are structured differently, so will take longer to return to health. <span class="companylink">Diageo</span>'s sales in Europe and Turkey—the company's second-most important region by revenue—fell almost one-third in the six months through June. Europe's alcohol market is split fifty-fifty between what is consumed inside and outside the home. So long as consumers are wary of crowded spaces, bars and restaurants will be ordering less beer and liquor from <span class="companylink">Diageo</span>. The company has already taken back half a million kegs of unsold Guinness from pubs, mainly in Europe and Africa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company took a £1.3 billion ($1.7 billion) write-down on the value of its businesses in India, Nigeria and Ethiopia. Around 60% of <span class="companylink">Diageo</span>'s sales in Africa are beer, which is mainly sold in bars. Last week, the world's biggest brewer <span class="companylink">AB InBev</span> also booked a big impairment charge[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/budweisers-glass-is-unexpectedly-half-full-11596118609] against its African beer business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Diageo</span>'s Asia division may bounce back first. India is an important market for scotch, and consumers there are big home drinkers, like in the U.S. A six-week ban on alcohol sales imposed by the Indian government, which ended in May, should only be a temporary shock to demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Diageo</span>'s share price is 17% off its January high, but that seems a sensible discount for today's uncertainties. A multiple of 23 times projected earnings is still well above its 10-year average of 19 times. Making a big chunk of sales in the U.S. is a bonus, but viewed from other corners of the world, the business looks much less defensive.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rise in Home Prices</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slowed to 4.5% in May</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth slowed slightly in May, as sales fell for a third straight month amid a widespread shutdown of economic activity in many parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 4.5% for the 12 months through May, down from a 4.6% annual rate the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes, which make up the bulk of the housing market, dropped 9.7% in May from a month earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors, as the pandemic continued to keep potential buyers at home. Existing-home sales have since surged 20.7% in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that the homeownership rate rose to 67.9% in the second quarter, up from 64.1% a year earlier and the highest level since mid-2008. The department said its data collection was affected by the coronavirus pandemic and its survey response rates declined, which could affect the accuracy of its estimates.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth slowed slightly in May, as home sales fell for a third straight month due to a widespread shutdown of economic activity in many parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 4.5% in the year that ended in May, down from a 4.6% annual rate the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes, which make up the bulk of the housing market, dropped 9.7% in May from a month earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors, as the pandemic continued to keep potential buyers at home. Existing-home sales have since surged 20.7% in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shortage of homes for sale around the U.S. has kept home-price growth from slowing further, economists say. Record-low interest rates have boosted demand from home buyers, while the inventory of homes for sale has dropped from year-ago levels as sellers remain cautious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller index reflects a three-month moving average. "You had the shutdowns in mid-March, you had the heart of the lockdown in April and some recovery in May," said Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American Financial Corp. But given the current strong demand and supply shortage, "everything that I'm looking at suggests that house price appreciation is already reaccelerating," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that the homeownership rate rose to 67.9% in the second quarter, up from 64.1% a year earlier and the highest level since mid-2008. However, the department said that its data collection was affected by the coronavirus pandemic and its survey response rates declined, which could affect the accuracy of its estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller 10-city index gained 3.1% over the year ended in May, compared with a 3.3% increase in April. The 20-city index rose 3.7%, after an annual gain of 3.9% in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected the 20-city index to gain 4.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 20-city index has measured only 19 cities since March due to transaction reporting delays in Wayne County, Mich., according to <span class="companylink">S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices</span>. Price growth accelerated in three of the 19 cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix had the fastest home-price growth in the country, at 9%, followed by Seattle at 6.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate measure of home-price growth by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> released last week found a 4.9% increase in home prices in May from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homeownership-rate data showed that the number of owner households rose in the second quarter from a year earlier, while the number of renter households fell. A decline in renter households was largely expected, as many college graduates and other renters moved in with friends and family due to the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For households headed by someone under 35 years old, a key source of homebuying demand, the homeownership rate rose to 40.6% from 36.4% a year earlier, the data showed.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Trump's top economic advisers say they still expect a rapid economic recovery despite surges in new coronavirus infections that have rattled consumers and led to new limits on business activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I still think the V-shaped recovery is in place," White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Sunday. "I don't deny that some of these hot-spot states are going to moderate that recovery, but on the whole the picture is very positive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kudlow pointed to data last week showing that sales of existing homes jumped 20.7% in June[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-rose-20-7-in-june-11595426758] after dropping 9.7% the month before, and another report showing that manufacturing in July expanded for the first time since February[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/europes-post-lockdown-rebound-bodes-well-for-global-economy-11595587952?st=so55wti5m5pypgn].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A government report on Thursday showed that filings for weekly unemployment benefits rose for the first time in nearly four months[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/unemployment-benefits-weekly-jobless-claims-coronavirus-11595444039] in the week ended July 18, a sign the jobs recovery could be faltering as some states rolled back reopenings[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/coronavirus-latest-news-07-20-2020-11595237858] because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the report also showed that unemployment rolls have shrunk in recent weeks, suggesting that new layoffs are being offset by hiring and employers recalling workers, though at a slower pace than a few weeks ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I do think the odds favor a big increase in jobs creation and a big reduction in unemployment" for July, Mr. Kudlow said on CNN's "State of the Union."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, speaking on Fox News' "Fox News Sunday," said Republicans would introduce their proposal[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/expiring-jobless-aid-puts-pressure-on-gop-senators-11595761201?st=axdjo7frz5tl6k4] for the next coronavirus relief bill on Monday and were prepared to act quickly to strike a deal with Democrats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. registered a further 65,490 infections and 914 deaths[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/coronavirus-latest-news-07-26-2020-11595740448] on Saturday, according to data compiled by <span class="companylink">Johns Hopkins University</span>. Mississippi reported a record 1,434 new cases Saturday, with its seven-day average more than quadrupling from a month ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We always said the second quarter was going to be a very bad quarter, again that's not for economic reasons, that's for health reasons," Mr. Mnuchin said Sunday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So we do think you're going to see a very big rebound," Mr. Mnuchin said, citing a consensus estimate for 17% economic growth at an annual rate in the third quarter.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Will Parker </div><div>570 words</div><div>24 July 2020</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A9B</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price to buy a home in the Hamptons reached an all-time high this summer, after wealthy New Yorkers flooded the market during the pandemic lockdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price of a single-family house in the ritzy Long Island refuge reached $1.1 million in the second quarter of 2020, according to a new report from appraisal firm Miller Samuel and real-estate brokerage <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>. That was a 25% increase in sales price compared with last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"[New Yorkers] went out to look for rentals and there's not nearly any adequate supply for that, so they purchased," said appraiser Jonathan Miller, author of the report. "It's a second home market that is beginning to take some of the characteristics of a primary market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vacation-rental demand in the coastal villages and enclaves that make up the Hamptons took off in March, as more New Yorkers were determined to ride out the lockdown in comfort and with extra space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seasonal Hamptons homeowners, who might ordinarily have spent the last stretches of winter skiing in Aspen or sunning in Anguilla, also decamped early to their summer homes. At first, the unexpected offseason population boom led to empty store shelves and concerns that hospitals would be overwhelmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But New Yorkers who made the move to escape the city's Covid-19 surge are starting to settle down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fall enrollment has spiked at Hamptons schools. New York City restaurants have followed their customers to the Long Island shores, opening Hamptons locations during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relatively steady demand for home buying in the Hamptons compared with Manhattan, where the total number of sales has declined much more significantly this year, suggests that something more substantial than coronavirus-dodging could be taking form, locals said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're loving it and they're planning to stay," said DeDe Gotthelf, owner of the Southampton Inn and resident of East Quogue, N.Y. "It's like July 4 weekend ever since March 15."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with sales prices at a record high, the barrier to entry has never been greater. According to the Miller Samuel report, the median sales price of a "luxury" home, defined as any sale occurring in the most expensive decile of the market, rose by 7% to $7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate brokers said high-earning workers in financial industries, who can now work from home, are among the most common customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan, they may live in relatively small apartments, but they are getting more space for their money in the Hamptons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space and comfort are the prime motivators for relocating for now, the brokers said. Still, this isn't a usual Hamptons summer. Charity galas and fundraisers, normally the high-water marks of the Hamptons' rarefied social scene, have moved to less glamorous venues online. Indoor dining and partying is still limited by local law, with restaurants operating more outdoor space than usual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ian Duke, owner of the Southampton Social Club, recently invested in a sound system for outdoor "silent discos," where partying guests can listen to DJs from their socially distanced tables on their own headphones -- loud outdoor noise is discouraged in the Hamptons and enforced by local laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have tried to give everyone who wants to be out as good a time as they can possibly have," Mr. Duke said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CNN chief Jeff Zucker has signed a deal to sell his Manhattan apartment. While the sale price wasn't clear, the Upper East Side apartment had been on the market asking $17.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the deal closes for close to that price, the apartment would be among the priciest to have sold in New York City since the coronavirus pandemic stalled the city's luxury housing market. Luxury home sales in Manhattan fell by about 54% in the second quarter compared with the same period last year, according to a recent report by <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zucker couldn't immediately be reached for comment. He and his wife, Caryn Zucker, bought the property for $12.3 million in 2007, property records show. The couple have since announced their split.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listing agents Linda Reiner and Lisa Tarnopol Deslauriers of Warburg Realty declined to comment. They listed the property for sale in February. The five-bedroom apartment is located at the Verona co-op on East 64th Street, in a building dating back to around 1910. Recently renovated, the unit has a library, three fireplaces, a 38-foot-long living room with Venetian plaster detailing and a dining room with silk velvet walls, according to the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zucker is chairman of WarnerMedia News and Sports and president of CNN Worldwide. He was formerly the chief executive of NBCUniversal.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nicole Friedman </div><div>992 words</div><div>23 July 2020</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sluggish U.S. housing market is staging a recovery amid the pandemic, shaking off high unemployment and a rising number of infections as buyers with pent-up demand seize on record-low mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes rose 20.7% in June over the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.72 million, according to data from the National Association of Realtors released on Wednesday, the biggest monthly increase on record going back to 1968. The surge in existing-home sales follows other recent bullish indicators such as rising new-home sales, robust home-builder activity and a flood of mortgage applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving sales are apartment renters seeking more space, young families moving to the suburbs, and wealthy city dwellers looking for second homes, brokers and economists say. At the same time, the supply of houses for sale remains low, with the coronavirus pandemic making potential sellers cautious about letting people tour their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market is hot, red hot," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for NAR, an industry trade group. "As we are coming out of the lockdown, we see this backlog of buyers . . . trying to take advantage of the record-low mortgage rates."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the jump in home sales, monthly activity remains well below levels that were seen before the spring lockdowns. June sales marked an 11.3% decrease from a year earlier. Many potential buyers remain on the sidelines, concerned about job security or the health risks related to visiting homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes, which make up the vast majority of U.S. housing stock, were particularly strong last month in the West and South. Mr. Yun said activity was higher in small towns and suburbs than in urban centers. Compared with a year earlier, sales increased for homes between $250,000 and $500,000, while declining for lower-priced and higher-priced homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home sales could boost the economy, as builders ramp up construction and new homeowners buy furniture and renovate. But a resurgence in Covid-19 cases and continued high unemployment could weigh on demand in the coming months. The housing market typically accounts for between 15% and 18% of the U.S. economy, according to the National <span class="companylink">Association of Home Builders</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been a rare bright spot for what is expected to be an exceptionally weak second quarter for the economy. Gross domestic product is expected to contract at a 35.3% annual rate in the second quarter, according to data firm <span class="companylink">IHS Markit</span>. That would mark the sharpest quarterly deterioration in records dating back to 1947.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales had been in a two-year rut headed into 2020, weighed down by perennially tight supply and historically high home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market showed signs of finally busting out when activity surged at the start of the year. February existing-homes sales hit their highest monthly pace in 13 years. But they hit a wall a few weeks later, after widespread lockdowns kept buyers indoors, prevented real-estate agents from showing homes in some places, and prompted some sellers to pull their houses off the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the major question is whether June's strong sales pace can continue through the summer. In the week ended July 14, about one-fourth of American adults missed their latest mortgage or rent payment or had little confidence they could make the next payment on time, according to a Census Bureau survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the sale closes, so the June data largely reflect purchase decisions made in April or May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some agents and brokers are optimistic that the usual spring demand has been pushed to the summer, and that momentum is building. The spring is normally the busiest season for home sales, as buyers with children want to move into new homes before the school year starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even in places where the virus is peaking, there is still interest in home buying," NAHB Chief Executive Jerry Howard said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the hottest markets in May, which would be reflected in the June sales data, were Phoenix, Nashville, Tenn., Jacksonville, Fla., and Austin, Texas, said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. <span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, parent of The Wall Street Journal, operates Realtor.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Phoenix area, some homes on the market are getting 20 or more offers, said Kelly Khalil, an agent with <span class="companylink">Redfin Corp</span>. The number of homes for sale is limited, and buyers are worried about missing out, she said. "I'm starting to feel like by this time next year, we won't have any houses under $400,000 in our hotter markets," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists warn that growing Covid-19 outbreaks in some parts of the country, including Arizona, Texas and Florida, could slow the market's gains. Some buyers from New York and California are delaying their trips to Miami to shop for homes amid concerns about the state's rising case count, said Danny Hertzberg, an agent with Coldwell Banker Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It felt like we were gaining momentum week after week, month after month, and all of a sudden there's a little bit of a pause," Mr. Hertzberg said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other housing indicators suggest a more bullish mood is emerging. A measure of U.S. home-builder confidence rose in July to pre-pandemic levels, the <span class="companylink">NAHB</span> said last week. Housing starts, a measure of U.S. home-building, also rose 17.3% in June from May, the Commerce Department said last week. Pending new-home sales rose to a record in June, Meyers Research said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 2.98% last week, the lowest level on record, said mortgage-finance giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Vipal Monga </div><div>754 words</div><div>21 July 2020</div><div>17:38</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TORONTO—Aggressive cuts by Canadian oil producers in the spring are starting to pay off in the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After coronavirus-related shutdowns stalled business, U.S. oil refiners have started making more gasoline for drivers who are returning to the road. That has increased demand for Canadian oil, which is the largest source of crude for Midwestern refineries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the recovery is still nascent and remains fragile, it is an improvement from March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, amid a global supply glut and pandemic-related slowdowns, oil prices plunged, and companies such as Calgary-based <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Husky Energy Inc</span>. decided to shut down wells[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/north-americas-oil-industry-is-shutting-off-the-spigot-11586770200] because they had few places to sell their oil profitably.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's oil industry, the world's fourth-largest crude producer, was hard hit by the pandemic because it is almost entirely dependent on the U.S. as an export market. As the U.S. economy froze, many Canadian producers eased production, cut spending, stopped share buybacks or shaved dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, they are sounding a more optimistic tone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're coming out of the other side of this in decent shape," said Matt Murphy, an analyst with <span class="companylink">Tudor Pickering Holt &amp; Co</span>. in Calgary. "I think in hindsight it will have been a fairly smart decision to cut production."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian producers in May cut average petroleum production by 1.3 million barrels a day more than February levels, according to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Energy Information Administration</span>. May's production of 4.4 million barrels a day was 20% lower than average monthly production in 2019. It was also the lowest since mid-2016, when wildfires burned through[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/alberta-forest-fire-halts-shell-oil-sands-operation-1462379036] large portions of the Canadian oil sands and many oil fields shut down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shut-in strategy has helped. A combination of rising demand and limited supply has shrunk crude-oil inventories, which were threatening to swamp available storage during the spring lockdowns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory in Western Canada totaled 28.6 million barrels as of June 26, down 214,000 from June 5, according to data provider Genscape. At the beginning of March, inventories totaled almost 31 million barrels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., by contrast, supply continues to exceed demand. Crude inventories rose slightly from May to a record 538.8 million barrels at the end of June, according to the <span class="companylink">American Petroleum Institute</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Refiners in the U.S. Midwest are geared toward processing the thicker crude that Canada exports and are willing to pay up for scarce supply, said Mr. Murphy. That is brightening Canadian producers' outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Exxon Mobil</span>-owned <span class="companylink">Imperial Oil Ltd</span>., which has three refineries in Canada that supply Canadian and U.S. markets, has been processing more gasoline and diesel fuel as economies have eased their Covid-19-related shutdowns, said Chief Executive Brad Corson, at a July energy conference. "If we continue on the path we're on, I feel quite optimistic," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western Canadian Select crude oil was selling for $32.64 a barrel on Tuesday, according to S&amp;P Global Platts, $9.45 lower than the U.S. benchmark grade West Texas Intermediate. The thicker Canadian oil trades at a discount to the U.S. benchmark because it is more difficult to refine and needs to travel farther to get to market. The differential had narrowed from roughly $23 in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian producers pay operating costs as high as $25 a barrel, so oil prices in the $30 range mean many are cash-flow positive and should be bringing more production back on line, said Platts analyst Parker Fawcett.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are already signs of increased drilling in Canada's oil patch. The number of oil-drilling rigs for the week ended July 17 rose by six to 32, according to oil-service company <span class="companylink">Baker Hughes</span>. Though the number is down 86 from the same time a year earlier, the weekly increase suggests that demand is picking up. In the U.S., on the other hand, the rig count fell by five in that week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary-based Cenovus, which shut in roughly 60,000 barrels a day of production in March, has since resumed production of most of the shut-in crude, said CEO Alex Pourbaix at a <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> energy conference earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are seeing a strong price signal to bring those barrels back on," said Mr. Pourbaix.</p>

Buyers on the West Coast are leaving the cities in favor of a permanent staycation.  ----  By Candace Taylor </div><div>1515 words</div><div>17 July 2020</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EAST</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Covid-19 struck New York City in March, Jessica and Matthew Perkal were among the many Manhattan residents who decided to wait out the pandemic in a more rural setting. Ms. Perkal, who is pregnant with the couple's second child, and her husband left their West Village apartment for Kiawah, a South Carolina barrier island where they had frequently vacationed with Ms. Perkal's family. "We thought, 'let's go somewhere we enjoy,' " said Ms. Perkal, who is originally from Charlotte, N.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first they rented on Kiawah, enjoying the "big wide beach" and biking with their daughter, Charlie. But as the pandemic dragged on, they started looking at houses for sale. They found a house they loved and bought it for $2 million, records show, moving in about a month ago. Once the pandemic is over they plan to return to New York City, Ms. Perkal said, using their new beach house for summer vacations and weekends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying a Kiawah home was something they had always wanted to do. "The pandemic was an impetus for things we were already thinking about," Ms. Perkal said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second-home sales in resort and rural communities have seen a surprising surge in recent months. On Kiawah, for example, local real-estate firm Kiawah Island Real Estate said it put 72 properties under contract in June, more than quadruple the number in June of last year. Unlike the West Coast, where a home sales boom is being fed by buyers relocating permanently, or buying homes to use for long-term staycations, many residents of East Coast metro areas are snatching up vacation homes as family escapes from whatever the pandemic brings next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite predictions that the pandemic would drive wealthy eastern urbanites to abandon cities, many of these buyers aren't giving up their primary homes, but rather acting on a longtime desire for a town-and-country lifestyle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers are "reassessing how they're going on vacation and spending their time," said Paul Grover, a real-estate agent on Cape Cod, a popular vacation destination on the Massachusetts coast. He said homes there are getting multiple offers and selling within a day or hours of hitting the market, a phenomenon previously unheard of in the area's generally unhurried market. "This is the strongest I've ever seen it," he said. "Having a house on the water or close to the water gives them the ability to be away without getting on a plane."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said most of these buyers -- many from the Boston area -- are keeping their primary homes. "For people in the city, the pandemic has opened their eyes to the fact that as great as it is to be in the city, it's good to have something else in situations that maybe nobody had thought of before."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the rural Hudson Valley north of New York City, home prices have increased 10% to 20% in the last three months, with homes selling after less than 24 hours on the market, according to Colin Brice, an architect and real-estate developer in the area. "When the pandemic hit, people were like 'I need to get out of here, at least for the summer,' " said Mr. Brice. For urbanites, he said, "the pandemic was a wake-up call that 'I need a place to go just in case.' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a sudden reversal of fortune for some markets that had struggled before the virus. The real-estate market in Connecticut, for example, was "sort of slumbering" before the pandemic, said Annette Coplit, a real-estate agent in the coastal town of Westport, Conn., a popular weekend-home destination for New Yorkers. But since the pandemic started, she said she's seeing bidding wars and people paying over the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've been in the business for 30 years, and I've never seen a market like this," she said. "Even at the peak in 2005 we didn't have this kind of demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Connecticut's rural Litchfield County, 13 listings priced from $1 million to $5 million sold in May, more than double the number in the same period of last year, according to Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices New England Properties. In Dutchess County in the Hudson Valley, the average home price jumped to $393,571 in June, 14% higher than the same month of last year, according to the brokerage Houlihan Lawrence. In the Hamptons, the number of new contracts signed in June leapt 88.5% from the same month last year, while Long Island's North Fork increased 29.2%, according to a <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> market report prepared by Miller Samuel. By contrast, the number of new contracts signed on the rest of Long Island fell 8.4% during the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Floridians Gretchen and Chad Rich take their five children on ski vacations in the Rocky Mountains every year. And while the Pensacola family had long dreamed of buying a ski house of their own, they never thought they would do it anytime soon, Mr. Rich said, until Covid-19 came along. In June, they paid $760,000 for a cabin on 2.5 wooded acres in Jackson Hole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was always one of those things, like 'wouldn't it be nice?' " said Mr. Rich, 50, an executive at <span class="companylink">OneDigital Health and Benefits</span>. But when the pandemic struck, "we wanted a safe, less-populated place for vacation, a place to run to that makes our family happy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Yorkers Roxanna Namavar and Shamim Ahmed had been looking for a Hamptons home when Covid-19 struck. "We were going to buy something anyway," said Dr. Namavar, a physician and founder of Pretty Healthy NYC. "It just sped up the timeline."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They found a house with a pool in East Hampton, which they liked for its high ceilings and because it was newly renovated, meaning they could move in right away. They made an offer for just under the asking price, beating out several other bidders. Since closing on the house in late May for $1.65 million, they have been living there full-time with their young son. Dr. Namavar said they expect to return to New York City once she can resume seeing patients in her Manhattan office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With timelines uncertain for returning to school and offices, many vacation-home buyers are seeking out properties that can double as full-time homes. Atlanta residents Tyler Scriven and his wife Faith McCoy Scriven were already in the process of looking for a weekend home when the pandemic hit. They had decided on the wellness community of Serenbe about 45 minutes outside Atlanta, Mr. Scriven said, and had their eye on an under-construction house there. But with the onset of coronavirus they changed course, choosing a larger, four-bedroom house that could potentially become their primary home, and that was already completed so they could start using it right away. They paid $770,000 for the home in early May, and have been spending weekends there with their 5-year-old son Patterson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's very nice to be able to have somewhere to go at this moment in time," said Mr. Scriven, co-founder of the Atlanta-based warehousing startup Saltbox. "We're probably not going to get on a plane for vacation anytime in the near future. So having this sort of outlet is really a game-changer for us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low interest rates are another factor for many vacation-home buyers, including Luke and Johanna Siegel, Manhattan residents who recently went into contract on a country home in Dutchess County, north of the city. "We're in the race to get our mortgage while the rate is still where it is," said Mr. Siegel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Siegels faced a lot of competition for their home. They saw it the day after it appeared on Zillow; the next day there were nine other showings. "It was a madhouse," he said. After beating out several other bidders, they are in contract for $517,000; the house had been listed for $485,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Siegel's business, the interior space divider company Raydoor, is based in New York City, and the couple's primary home is a live-work space in Hudson Yards. They plan to split their time between Manhattan and their new house, which sits on 30 acres with a barn. It is something they have thought about for years, but the pandemic made it feel more urgent, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you're on some kind of fence," Mr. Siegel said, "Covid shoves you off of it."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Stella Yifan Xie and Mike Bird </div><div>2253 words</div><div>16 July 2020</div><div>23:22</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the coronavirus hasn't stopped the world's biggest asset bubble from getting bigger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a brief pause during coronavirus lockdowns in February, a Chinese property boom[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chinas-latest-property-bubble-more-perilous-than-last-one-1475860134?tesla=y&amp;mod=article_inline] in some megacities that many thought was unsustainable has resumed its relentless upward climb, with prices rising higher and investors chasing deals despite millions of job losses and other economic problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, 288 apartments in a new Shenzhen property development sold out online in less than eight minutes. A few days later, buyers snapped up more than 400 units in a new housing complex in Suzhou. In Shanghai, apartment resales neared a record high in April, by one estimate. One Saturday last month, nearly 9,000 people each put down a deposit of one million yuan ($141,300) to qualify to buy apartments in a Shenzhen development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I barely had time for lunch on weekends in March" when the market started bouncing back, said Zhao Wenhao, a Shanghai-based agent at Lianjia, one of China's largest real-estate brokerage firms. Many clients worry China's currency will depreciate in the global economic slowdown, he said, driving even more money into housing as a haven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resulting asset bubble, many economists say, now eclipses the one in U.S. housing in the 2000s. At the peak of the U.S. property boom, about $900 billion a year was being invested in residential real estate. In the 12 months ended in June, about $1.4 trillion was invested in Chinese housing. More was invested last month in Chinese real estate than any other month on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total value of Chinese homes and developers' inventory hit $52 trillion in 2019, according to <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>., twice the size of the U.S. residential market and outstripping even the entire U.S. bond market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market's coronavirus pause didn't last long. Urban home prices in China were 4.9% higher in June than in the year-earlier period. Year-to-date investment is up 1.9% in the first half of the year, despite a huge drop in sales in February. On Thursday, China said its overall economy grew by 3.2%[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chinas-economy-appears-back-on-track-but-challenges-remain-11594901270?mod=hp_lead_pos7] in the three months ended June 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China Evergrande, the country's biggest home builder, has raised its sales target for the year by 23% from its January estimate, after strong sales in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the rapid housing-market recovery is good news on one level for Beijing, it is also a reminder of behavior that has long worried the central government, which has tried repeatedly to keep property prices from getting out of control. Chinese President Xi Jinping declared in 2017 that "houses are built to be lived in, not for speculation," which became the guiding mantra for government housing policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting people to take that message seriously, though, has been hard. After a decade of rapid home-sales growth, fueled by borrowing, China's household leverage ratio hit a record high of 57.7% in the first quarter. It was the biggest quarterly jump in the ratio, which measures families' mortgage, consumer and other debts relative to gross domestic product, since the first quarter of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central problem in China is that buyers have figured out the government doesn't appear to be willing to let the market fall. If home prices did drop significantly, it would wipe out most citizens' primary source of wealth and potentially trigger unrest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That gives Chinese citizens who have enough money an incentive to keep buying because they believe property in large cities will remain the safest investment in China, regardless of the health of the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Property has hijacked China's economy, so the government wouldn't dare to push for a plunge in housing prices, even if that's the most effective way to deflate the bubble," said Chen Zhiyu, who works for an American retailer and is looking to purchase a property in Shenzhen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You gotta follow the money," said the 37-year-old, adding that he has raised his budget for spending on property since the coronavirus pandemic helped drive up prices. "Whenever governments start printing money, asset prices will go up. In the U.S., you have a bull stock market, but in China, only housing prices will keep surging."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales activity is also being driven by cash-strapped developers and the local governments that sell them land. Both need to gin up revenue to pay down debts[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/bills-come-due-for-chinas-local-governments-11577467587] or offset other problems, and are cooking up more incentives to move properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one is sure how Chinese officials can manage the problem without destabilizing the broader economy. Even if the market stays strong, it creates headaches for policy makers, who have had to hold off on more aggressive economic stimulus this year—which some analysts say is needed—partly because of fears it will inflate housing further[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chinas-developers-go-on-borrowing-spree-11549967846].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Polling conducted by the China Household Finance Survey, based in the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in Chengdu, suggests the coronavirus pandemic has encouraged the kind of buying Beijing worries about, with demand for property rising among people who already own multiple properties, even as it has dropped among those who don't yet own any.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a telltale sign of speculative investment, according to Gan Li, a professor of economics at Texas A&amp;M University and an expert in Chinese household finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Speculative demand is on the rise because [people] view housing as a safer asset than the stock market or overseas assets," he said. "They think it's guaranteed. Because of the pandemic they're actually consuming less, and saving more. So they'll actually have more money available to invest. That will create an even larger housing problem."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 21% of homes in urban China were vacant in 2017—a very high proportion relative to international standards—which equated to 65 million empty units, according to the most recent data from China Household Finance Survey. Among families who owned two properties, the vacancy rate reached 39.4%, and among those that owned three or more, 48.2% were empty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rental yields—the proportion of a property's value made annually by renting it out—are below 2% in major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Chengdu, less than can be made buying Chinese government bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, Shannon Bi, a 42-year-old English teacher, said the pandemic has pushed her to invest in a second home in Shenzhen sooner than she planned, because she worries about inflation. "You have to invest the money somewhere, or it will only depreciate," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another buyer, Doris Tao, said she and her husband signed a contract in early May on a second home in Shanghai. She hoped that purchasing the apartment in a desirable school district would increase her chances of enrolling her 3-year-old son in a good elementary school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been paying close attention for months. Usually these flats were snatched the minute they became available," said Ms. Tao, 32, who decided to buy the day after visiting the apartment. "We were so lucky to be able to buy this one. Our owner said she got another offer in full cash the night we signed the contract."</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of what is so worrisome to some economists is the speed at which China's property boom has grown so large, and its tendency to keep climbing even during times of economic stress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As recently as the 1990s, it was illegal under China's communist system for most people to own homes. A State Council decision in 1998 abandoned the country's system of employer-allocated housing, and homeownership took off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By late last year, about 96% of China's urban households owned at least one home, according to a <span class="companylink">Chinese central bank</span> survey released in April, far exceeding the 65% homeownership rate in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some ways, the boom accomplished Beijing's goals. It has boosted economic growth and created wealth for millions of middle-class Chinese families. It also gave local governments, which must turn over a major part of income-tax revenue to the central government, additional revenue from land sales to developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the boom has taken investment dollars away from other industries competing with real-estate borrowers for bank funding. It also has saddled many families with debt. Globally, China accounted for around 57% of the $11.6 trillion increase in household borrowing over the decade through 2019, according to <span class="companylink">Bank for International Settlements</span> data. The U.S. accounted for about 19%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Share Your Thoughts</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do you think residential real estate is a good investment in the current economic environment? Join the conversation below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in some Chinese cities have reached levels comparable with some of the world's most expensive urban areas. Average home prices across China reached 9.3 times average income in 2018, according to the <span class="companylink">Chinese Academy of Social Sciences</span>, compared with 8.4 in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Tianjin, a city of 15 million southeast of Beijing, apartments in upscale areas sell for around $9,000 a square meter, or about $836 a square foot, according to real-estate services company <span class="companylink">Savills PLC</span>. That is roughly the price an average buyer would pay in some of the most expensive parts of London, even though disposable incomes are seven times as high in London as in Tianjin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In essence, urban Chinese have bet everything on their homes. They now have nearly 78% of their wealth tied up in residential property, versus 35% in the U.S., where more people invest in stocks and pensions, according to a report by <span class="companylink">China Guangfa Bank</span> and Southwestern University of Finance and Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the coronavirus pandemic hit China, many economists and property experts feared the moment of truth had arrived. Housing sales plunged by 36% in the first two months of 2020 compared with a year earlier, and many cash-strapped property firms were pushed over the brink. As of June 5, more than 200 small developers had filed for bankruptcy, according to state media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bigger developers and local governments rolled out incentives to bring buyers back. Since February, at least 26 of 32 Chinese provinces and regions have unveiled policies to boost their property markets, according to <span class="companylink">Huatai Securities</span>, including looser down-payment requirements and subsidies for home purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While local governments are under pressure to prevent further surges in housing prices, what scares them more is a sharp decline," said Gao Fei, general manager at real-estate firm Centaline Group in Tianjin. They can ill afford to let the market go down. Income from land sales and related taxes on developers accounted for 52.9% of local governments' revenue in 2019, a record high, according to Shanghai Yiju Real Estate Research Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, in a sign the central government disapproves of some of the loosening measures[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/protests-opposing-chinas-crackdown-on-housing-speculation-swell-1497264906], in at least 12 cities, including Jinan and Guangzhou, documents detailing relaxed lending policies were removed from local governments' official websites within days. One city in Shandong province backed off plans to provide subsidies to home buyers in mid-May, saying some parts of its plan "violate relevant requirements from senior officials."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China Evergrande,whose enormous debts give it the largest interest bill in the world[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/everythings-25-off-at-the-worlds-most-debt-squeezed-company-11582105771] among listed nonfinancial stocks, according to Capital IQ data, offered discounts of 25% in February and 22% in March. <span class="companylink">Country Garden Holdings</span>, another major developer, offered more than 17,000 new homes across China via social media with discounts of up to 50%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among China's 34 largest developers, 27 reported a year-over-year increase of sales volume in May, according to data from <span class="companylink">China Real Estate Information Corporation</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, incentives have been trimmed, though not entirely. At one development in Shanghai in mid-May, <span class="companylink">CK Asset Holdings</span> offered prospective buyers a <span class="companylink">Huawei</span> phone and vouchers of 20,000 to 40,000 yuan ($2,800 to $5,600) for future apartment-management fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other developments, no discounts were on offer, and would-be buyers had to enter lotteries to access the smaller and cheaper apartments. <span class="companylink">China Vanke Co</span>. sold apartments in mid-May worth a total of 148 million yuan ($20.8 million) within four hours online in a live-streaming show hosted by an actress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yin Haiping, who runs a property consulting firm in Shenzhen, said fear of losing out is driving more buyers to look now, with home prices in some desirable areas up by at least 10% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Xu Xiaohua, a university lecturer in Tianjin who already owns a property there, just bought another apartment this month in Shenzhen. He paid 6.5 million yuan ($913,050) in cash in early May for the 50-square-meter (538-square-foot) property after checking out about a dozen apartments within a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he thinks most Chinese will park their wealth in real estate during downturns. "The worse China's economy turns," he said, "the higher property prices in places like Shenzhen will climb."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jing Yang </div><div>629 words</div><div>10 July 2020</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beike Zhaofang, a Chinese online property brokerage backed by <span class="companylink">SoftBank Group Corp</span>., is planning to raise up to $3 billion in an initial public offering in the coming months, according to people familiar with the matter, in what would be the largest listing of a Chinese company in the U.S. in more than two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beike, which means seashell in Mandarin, was valued at slightly more than $14 billion after raising $1 billion in November from SoftBank and another $500 million from private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Hillhouse Capital Group</span>, social-media giant <span class="companylink">Tencent Holdings Ltd</span>. and venture-capital firm Sequoia Capital, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two-year-old company is seeking a valuation of more than $20 billion at its IPO, according to one of the people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beijing-based Beike has filed a confidential listing application with the <span class="companylink">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</span>, and a public filing could come out as soon as this month, according to a different person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for Beike declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's housing market has gone through a yearslong boom, and while the coronavirus pandemic dented home sales in the country early this year, property sales and housing prices in some major cities have picked up again in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Beike's IPO plans come at a tumultuous time for U.S.-listed Chinese companies and other firms in China that are contemplating going public in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, a stunning disclosure of fabricated sales by Chinese coffee chain <span class="companylink">Luckin Coffee Inc</span>. spotlighted the perils of investing in overseas businesses whose financial accounts are subject to less scrutiny than American companies that are listed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Public Company Accounting Oversight Board</span>, which the SEC oversees, cannot routinely inspect the audit papers of Chinese companies, due to a lack of cooperation between securities regulators in the U.S. and China. That has hampered U.S. authorities' ability to enforce investor-protection laws, and the SEC in April issued a warning about the risks of investing in companies from emerging markets, including China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, the Senate passed a bill that would kick Chinese companies off U.S. stock exchanges if their auditors haven't been inspected by the PCAOB for three consecutive years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beike has nevertheless decided to go ahead with a U.S. IPO. The company recently raised its expectations for the size of its coming share sale after receiving positive feedback from investors during a roadshow last month, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is aiming to raise $2 billion to $3 billion, and has hired <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">China Renaissance Holdings Ltd</span>. and <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> as lead underwriters on the deal, the people said. The details are subject to market conditions and could change, they added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sale of that size would be the largest IPO of a Chinese company since March 2018, when Chinese video streaming site <span class="companylink">iQiyi</span> raised $2.4 billion in a <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> offering, according to Dealogic data. A total of seven Chinese companies have gone public in the U.S. since Luckin's accounting scandal emerged in April, raising a combined $2 billion, the data showed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign buying of U.S. homes was a driving factor in markets from California to Florida, helping prices reach new highs. Now, the pandemic, reduced travel and immigration restrictions are further undermining already weakening international demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overseas residential real-estate purchases climbed steadily between 2011 and 2017, peaking at $153 billion[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/big-jump-in-foreign-buying-adds-to-home-price-pressures-1500397264] in the year ended March 2017, according to the National Association of Realtors. About 60% of foreign buyers are recent immigrants or foreigners who live in the U.S., while others buy U.S. homes as investment properties or vacation homes, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreigners represent a tiny percentage of overall buyers. But because they have tended to cluster in coastal cities like New York, Miami and the Los Angeles area, they sometimes have had an exaggerated influence in these markets, especially at the higher-price end. Foreigners also were more likely to pay cash, making their offers more attractive to sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign appetite fell sharply in 2018 and 2019[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/foreign-buying-of-u-s-homes-suffers-record-drop-11563396472], according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>. Much of the buying came from China. It slowed in 2019 after the Chinese government implemented new controls over foreign currency purchases and as the country's trade dispute with the U.S. heated up. A stronger dollar, which makes U.S. homes more expensive in foreign currencies, and concerns about global economic growth slowed overseas buying more broadly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, demand looks likely to be even weaker, real-estate agents say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Limited travel between the U.S. and other countries, worries about virus transmission and new restrictions on immigration could weigh on international investment in U.S. housing this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With foreign demand falling, what other forces can help lift home prices? Join the conversation below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest setback for foreign homeownership in the U.S., President Trump signed an order June 22 temporarily barring new immigrants on certain employment-based visas[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/trump-order-would-temporarily-suspend-new-h-1b-other-visas-11592853371] through the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the lack of overseas demand may disappoint homeowners in major coastal cities that attracted much of the foreign demand, local buyers who have lost out in bidding wars to deep-pocketed foreigners might be relieved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some decline in international buying activity I don't think necessarily harms the U.S. housing market," said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. "If anything, it doesn't put any additional upward pressure on home prices, which have been a major concern for buyers on the affordability front."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have continued to rise during the pandemic, even as the rate of home sales has dropped. The supply of homes for sale remains limited in many markets, and demand from buyers has increased in recent weeks as business activity has opened up in many states and mortgage rates have stayed low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign investment in U.S. housing can push up local home prices in select markets, according to a working paper released last month[https://www.nber.org/papers/w27370.pdf]by Caitlin Gorback and Benjamin Keys of the <span class="companylink">University of Pennsylvania</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The paper found that in ZIP Codes with a high proportion of foreign-born Chinese, house prices between 2012 and 2018 grew by 8 percentage points more than in comparable ZIP Codes. These areas, which in many cases also attracted strong local demand, could be vulnerable to price erosion as both domestic and foreign buying pulls back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The neighborhoods that are highly exposed to foreign investment on the upside are also exposed on the downside," Mr. Keys said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many foreign investors buy homes for their children to live in while attending school in the U.S., and those purchases are on hold while families wait to see whether schools will be open in the fall, said Vicky Silvano, broker at Baird &amp; Warner in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Because of the pandemic, the people that I work with are just on a 'wait and see' right now," Ms. Silvano said. For foreign investors who own homes in the U.S., "I think there's going to be more selling if the kids don't come back to school" this year, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Indiana University</span> has drawn many foreign buyers to Bloomington, Ind., in the past decade, said Tracee Lutes, broker owner at Re/Max Acclaimed Properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we will have a lot fewer foreign investment buyers here this year…with the uncertainty in the university plans and the uncertainty in the Covid situation," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Indiana University</span> said in May that it plans to open in the fall for a mix of in-person and online classes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing demand is strong in Bloomington, and a decline in foreign investment could be a boon to local shoppers, Ms. Lutes said: "I think you would see more in-state people, local people, that would take advantage of the ability to buy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some see foreign buying picking up once normal travel resumes. In New Jersey and New York, Grace Tan of Prominent Properties Sotheby's International Realty said her international clients in countries like China are already planning to shop for homes in the U.S. once international travel picks up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These clients are still not comfortable buying virtually," she said. "They will come back. I already get the phone calls."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales figures show the U.S. housing market got a lot better last month. Probably.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department on Tuesday said sales of new homes in May clocked in at an annualized 676,000, adjusted for seasonal swings. That compared with 580,000 new homes sold in April, and was well above the 640,000 economists were looking for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This suggests that the relaxation of Covid-19-related restrictions, along with the sharp decline in borrowing costs, is pushing the housing market to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new-home sales figures were far better than what Monday's numbers on existing-home sales showed. The National Association of Realtors reported sales of previously owned homes fell 9.7% in May from April, a sharper decline than economists expected. But the new-home sales data is more timely than the existing-home sales numbers. That is because new-home sales are based on contract signings, while existing-home sales are based on closings. So the recovery in new-home sales is likely closer to the reality of what was happening on the ground in May than what the existing-home sales figures show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The caveat is that the new-home sales data can be subject to big revisions. Indeed, in Tuesday's report April sales figures were revised downward by 6.9%, which doesn't count as particularly extreme for the report. As a result, the average level of new-home sales for April and May together was about even with what economists thought it would be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the trajectory matters, so barring a big downward revision to the May report, the stage seems set for a further recovery in June -- the last big month of the selling season. From there the direction of the housing market would rest on how far the economy opens in the months ahead, and how successful areas that are seeing a pickup in Covid-19 cases are in bringing the pandemic under control.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes dropped 9.7% in May from the prior month, as the coronavirus pandemic[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/who-has-covid-19-what-we-know-about-tests-for-the-new-coronavirus-11585868185?mod=theme_coronavirus-ribbon] kept shoppers indoors during the typically busy spring homebuying season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But record-low interest rates have lured buyers off the sidelines in recent weeks, economists and brokerages say, and they expect sales to pick up starting in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales fell in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.91 million[https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/existing-home-sales-fall-9-7-in-may-while-nar-expects-strong-rebound-in-coming-months], the National Association of Realtors said Monday. Previously-owned homes make up most of the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales have plunged since hitting a</p>

13-year high in February[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-jumped-in-february-11584712882]. The May closings represent the lowest annualized sales activity since October 2010, said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected an 8.8% monthly decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, so the May data largely reflects purchase decisions made in March or April, when millions of Americans were staying home to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We hit a low point in the month of May, [but] it looks like quite a sharp rebound ahead," Mr. Yun said, citing an increase in pending sales in some regions in recent weeks. "It looks like a V-shaped recovery for the housing sector."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ashley Leonard and Justin Leonard closed on the purchase on their first house in Beech Island, S.C., in May. The couple had previously been living in a rental apartment with their 2-year-old daughter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We weren't serious buyers up until probably three weeks or so into quarantine," Ms. Leonard said. "Then we looked around and realized we had zero space and we needed to move into a permanent house."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May and June, home shopping has increased as business activity has opened up in many states and mortgage rates have stayed low, real-estate agents say. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 3.13% last week, the lowest level on record, said mortgage-finance giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As economies are opening up again, we're seeing consumers spend[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/shoppers-returned-in-may-likely-spurring-increased-retail-sales-11592299802]," said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide, citing a record jump in retail sales in May. "The same thing will be true of housing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amy Rohrer and Konner Rohrer of Dallas had planned to buy a house in the next year or so, but decided to start shopping this spring after seeing that rates had dropped to new lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We thought, 'Let's see what we can qualify for, since the interest rates are so low right now,'" said Ms. Rohrer. "We qualified for more than we thought and we could afford more than we thought, so we met some Realtors and got going."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales fell the most month-over-month in the Northeast, at 13%, and in the West, at 11.1%, according to the <span class="companylink">NAR</span> data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median existing-home price rose 2.3% from a year earlier to $284,600. A shortage of homes for sale in many markets has kept prices elevated[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/why-home-prices-are-rising-during-the-pandemic-11588671002], economists say. The number of homes for sale at the end of May rose from April to 1.55 million units, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said. At the current sales pace, there was a 4.8-month supply of homes on the market at the end of May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales, which make up about 10% of the market, started to show more positive signs in May. Housing starts, a measure of U.S. home-building, rose 4.3% in May from April, the Commerce Department said last week. Residential permits, which can be a bellwether for future home construction, rose 14.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales are likely to pick up faster than existing-home sales, because the supply of existing homes on the market is limited and consumers might be more comfortable during the pandemic touring newly built homes, Mr. Berson said.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Housing Recovery Is Still on the Drafting Board; The sharp rebound in building permits, and the disappointing one in housing starts, underscores the difference between planning to build something and building it</span>
</div><div class="author">By Justin Lahart </div><div>420 words</div><div>17 June 2020</div><div>12:25</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planning on building something is one thing. Building it is another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department on Wednesday reported thatconstruction started on 4.3% more homes in May[https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf] than a month earlier, adjusting for seasonal swings. That was a partial reversal of April's 26.4% decline in housing starts, but nothing like the 22.3% jump economists expected to see. The report showed that the number of permits authorizing residential construction rose a much sharper 14.4%, though, which was better than economists' estimated gain of 10.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing-starts figures seemed a bit out of step with what other housing data have been showing. On Tuesday, the National <span class="companylink">Association of Home Builders</span> said that its measure of builder sentiment registered its largest jump ever[http://eyeonhousing.org/2020/06/builder-confidence-surges-in-june/]this month. Meanwhile, mortgage applications for home purchases have rebounded as people have taken up plans to buy homes again, helped along by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s efforts to lower borrowing costs in response to the Covid-19 crisis[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/what-we-know-about-the-coronavirus-11579716128].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the rebound in construction was merely a bit delayed in May and bigger jumps in housing starts will be coming soon, but there are two potential hurdles to that happening that investors should consider. The first is that the novel coronavirus crisis has made it harder to build a house. Workers in many places are now required to take additional safety measures while on the job, which can slow things down. Moreover, the supply-chain problems and shipping delays that the pandemic has introduced can make some tools, materials and parts harder to come by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second is demand. There is good reason to be optimistic it will be picking up in the months ahead, and making anticipatory moves such as applying for building permits makes sense. But with the economy still on the ropes and the course of the pandemic uncertain, actually breaking ground on a new home is a big step. It takes nearly eight months to construct a single-family home.[http://eyeonhousing.org/2019/10/time-to-build-a-single-family-home-in-2018/] If ever there was a lot of uncertainty about what will occur in the next eight months, it is now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the housing boom and bust of the 2000s, home builders got a painful lesson in what can happen when optimism runs ahead of reality. It isn't a mistake they are likely to repeat now.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jonathan Cheng </div><div>906 words</div><div>15 June 2020</div><div>02:29</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING—China's factory-led recovery enjoyed an extra boost last month as Chinese consumers stepped up to make big-ticket purchases, pushing up home prices and auto-sales numbers and prompting economists to increase their growth outlook for the world's second-largest economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Official Chinese economic data released Monday showed improvement across a variety of indicators, including in its headline jobless rate, raising optimism for the global economy even as recessionary anxieties loom over much of the developed world and as fears of a second wave of infection in China are intensifying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An official gauge of unemployment in Chinese cities showed a slight fall to 5.9% in May, a tick down from April's 6.0% figure and a further improvement after the national surveyed unemployment rate surged to a record 6.2% in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Value-added industrial production, a measure of output in manufacturing, mining and utilities, grew 4.4% in May from a year earlier, following a 3.9% year-over-year expansion in April, the National Bureau of Statistics said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail sales and fixed-asset investment, though still coming in weaker than the same period a year earlier, continued to show strong signs of improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail sales slipped 2.8% in May from a year earlier, official data showed, much narrower than April's 7.5% year-over-year decline. The improved reading was fueled by a 3.5% increase in auto sales from a year earlier, the best month by this metric in more than two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in China also fell by less in the January-to-May period from a year earlier as easier credit gave some home buyers more confidence to invest. Monday's data release showed average new-home prices in major Chinese cities continuing to rise in May from the previous month. Purchases of home appliances and furniture also returned to growth in May alongside the improvement in sentiment around homebuying, said Zhang Min, an official with the statistics bureau, in a statement accompanying the data release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, an infrastructure-construction binge helped to support nonrural fixed-asset investment—a measure that captures investment in factories, railroads and new homes. That indicator fell by 6.3% for the January-May period compared with a year earlier; during the first four months, fixed-asset investment had plunged 10.3% from the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the jobs front, the decline in the headline number to 5.9% offered further hope that China's economy has turned a corner, though many economists have questioned the survey's ability[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chinas-jobs-rebound-doesnt-appear-as-robust-as-the-government-claims-11591551390] to capture laborers who haven't returned to the workforce because of the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taken together, the encouraging indicators suggested to many economists that momentum around China's coronavirus recovery is finally gathering a head of steam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Monday's data release, Louis Kuijs, a Hong Kong-based economist for Oxford Economics, revised his full-year forecast for China's gross domestic product to growth of 2.0% to 2.5% from last year, from a previous prediction of 0.8% growth. "We expect the recovery to continue, aided by policy support," he told clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Martin Rasmussen, an economist at Capital Economics, signaled that he, too, would increase his GDP forecast. Mr. Rasmussen had previously predicted China's economy would return to positive year-over-year growth only in the third quarter of the year, but the Monday data suggests China may already have reached this milestone, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, it isn't clear how long-lasting the rebound will be. In recent days, Beijing municipal authorities have begun tightening restrictions again after several dozen new coronavirus infections[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/beijing-coronavirus-outbreak-tied-to-huge-market-sparks-resurgence-concerns-11592141786] were identified around a major food wholesale market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revived fears around infection could make Chinese consumers hesitant to spend more, said UBS economist Zhang Ning, who says consumption faces more challenges than production, since it is driven by sentiment and workers' incomes, which have stagnated in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recovery will also have to contend with a global economy that remains fragile—and that could hit the export-driven sectors of the economy in the third quarter of the year, said Larry Hu, an economist at Macquarie Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, though, Mr. Hu said, the bundle of economic indicators on Monday pointed to a robust growth reading for the second quarter, in line with his prediction for GDP to rise by 2% to 3% this quarter after a 6.8% contraction in the first three months of 2020, China's first quarterly pullback in more than four decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For now, the housing market remains the most important pillar of the economy," said Mr. Hu, who is based in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the many headwinds, Beijing will likely stick to its current slate of easing measures, including ensuring sufficient liquidity in the financial market, economists say. Beijing has said it won't resort to aggressive policy-easing measures[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/china-scraps-gdp-target-for-2020-11590111014] despite the pandemic, pointing to lingering concerns about China's overall debt level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">China's central bank</span> on Monday injected 200 billion yuan ($28.24 billion) of liquidity into the banking system via its medium-term lending facility but kept the one-year maturity rate unchanged.</p>
