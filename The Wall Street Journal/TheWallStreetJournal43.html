<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales in August dropped a seasonally adjusted 6.5% from July, as tighter restrictions on mortgage lending made it tougher for some would-be buyers to get financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline, which came on the heels of a revised 10.7% drop in July, was steeper than expected. Pending home sales, as tracked by the National Association of Realtors, are now at their lowest since the data were first published in 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales are the number of home-sale contracts signed, but which haven't yet closed, and serve as a leading indicator of existing-home sales. But because they don't reflect the rising number of cancellations, the figures may overstate the probable number of existing-home sales, which are based on sales that have closed. The latest data suggest that sales of existing, or previously owned, homes have yet to hit bottom. Those figures are to be released Oct. 24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales in August dropped 21.5% from a year earlier, reflecting weakness nationwide. Sales in the West, heavily influenced by California, fell 27.1%. Sales in the South fell 21.3%, while those in the Northeast declined 18.3% and Midwest sales were down 18%. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key measure of inflation softened in August to its lowest point in more than three years, the latest evidence that price increases remain moderate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price index for personal-consumption expenditures rose 1.8% in August from a year earlier, after increasing 2.1% in July, the Commerce Department said. The PCE index excluding food and energy -- the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge -- rose 1.8% from a year earlier, after increasing 1.9% in July. The August increase was the smallest since February 2004 and put it in the 1%-to-2% comfort zone of some Fed officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal income rose at a seasonally adjusted rate of 0.3% in August from a month earlier, compared with July's gain of 0.5%. Spending surged 0.6%, following July's 0.4% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the department said construction spending in August rose by an annual 0.2%, as nonresidential activity continued to offset the deepening housing downturn. Private-sector construction was flat, while government outlays surged. Construction spending in July rose at a 0.5% pace. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of new homes resumed their decline last month, sinking to their lowest level in seven years, and prices tumbled, an indication the housing sector will remain a drag on the U.S. economy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new single-family homes fell 8.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 795,000 units, the Commerce Department said Thursday. New-home sales rose a revised 3.8% in July. Originally, the government had said July sales rose 2.8%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector has cost the U.S. economy growth for six-straight quarters, and tighter lending standards and turmoil in the mortgage market have made conditions difficult for would-be buyers. Falling home prices also are causing potential homeowners to think twice about a purchase. As a result, new-home sales last month were 21.2% below the pace of a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a new home last month was $225,700, down 7.5% from a year earlier. The average price declined 8% to $292,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of new houses for sale rose to 8.2 months' worth at the current sales pace from 7.6 months in July. There were an estimated 529,000 new homes for sale at the end of August, down from July's 537,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department also reported that the U.S. economy was a bit softer in spring than previously estimated, partly because international trade provided a smaller boost than had been estimated. The adjustment was in line with expectations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. gross domestic product rose at a still-robust 3.8% annual rate in the second quarter, rather than the 4% previously estimated. Higher imports were the main factor behind the revision.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The climb in second-quarter GDP, the value of goods and services produced in the economy, marked the strongest increase since a 4.8% surge in the first quarter of last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some gauges of second-quarter price inflation were revised slightly higher. The price index for personal-consumption expenditures increased 4.3% from the previously estimated 4.2% climb and the first quarter's 3.5% rise. Excluding food and energy, the index increased 1.4%, above a previously estimated 1.3% advance but down from the first quarter's 2.4% climb.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential fixed investment, which includes spending on housing, plunged by 11.8%, a bigger drop than the previously estimated 11.6%. The plunge took a bite of 0.62 percentage point out of GDP.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits tumbled last week to a four-month low, adding support to evidence that last month's surprising decline in employment was temporary. Jobless claims in the week ended Saturday fell 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 298,000, the lowest level since May 12.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week average, which economists use to gauge underlying labor market trends, fell by 9,750 to 311,500, the lowest level since Aug. 4. That was the fourth-straight decline for the measure.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By Sudeep Reddy </div><div>571 words</div><div>28 September 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite huge discounts, sales of new homes last month slowed to their slowest pace in seven years, setting the stage for further price declines well into next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market continues to cloud the economic outlook. A chief concern: The housing turmoil could damp spending by consumers, who already are showing signs of pulling back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the news was tempered somewhat by data showing that jobless claims fell last week. That indicated the labor market might be in better shape than was suggested by a report, released earlier this month, showing payrolls in August fell for the first time in four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the government reported that the nation's gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 3.8% in the April-to-June quarter, slightly less than the 4% estimated earlier. After-tax corporate profits rose 5.2% to $1.15 trillion. Many economists believe growth in the third quarter will slow to a rate of about 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-homes sales dropped 8.3% in August from July, to an annual pace of 795,000 homes, the Commerce Department said. Sales of homes priced above $500,000 were hit especially hard. Home buyers faced more restrictive terms for mortgages; rates also rose for jumbo loans, those over $417,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, KB Home, a Los Angeles home builder, reported a loss of $35.6 million, or 46 cents a share, for the quarter ended Aug. 31. That compared with a net profit of $153.2 million, or $1.90 a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We see no signs that the housing market is stabilizing and believe it will be some time before a recovery begins," said Jeffrey Mezger, KB Home's president and chief executive. He said lenders' tighter mortgage standards and buyers' heightened caution is restraining demand, while an oversupply of homes is pushing prices down. Earlier this week, Lennar Corp., another big home builder, posted larger-than-expected losses for the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 68,000 homes were sold last month, down from 74,000 in July, the government said. At the end of August, 531,000 homes were on the market -- and only about a third of them were finished. That means builders could be stuck with large inventories as the market weakens further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is staggering," said Joseph Brusuelas, chief U.S. economist at IDEAglobal, a research firm that advises investors. Further big price declines, he said, are "going to be debilitating."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only about 6,000 new homes priced at $500,000 or more were sold in August, down from 9,000 in each of the previous three months and 11,000 in August 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jobless claims dropped last week, despite expectations that a wave of layoffs in the mortgage sector would boost the figure. Initial claims for unemployment benefits fell 15,000 to 298,000, the second weekly decline and the lowest level since May, the Labor Department said. The four-week moving average fell by 9,750 to 311,500, the fourth straight drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jobless report helps bolster forecasts that while the housing slump may brake growth, the economy "will not degenerate into a full-fledged recession," David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities, said in a note to clients.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Demand in the U.S. for previously owned homes tumbled last month to the lowest level in five years, damaged by troubles in the mortgage market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, consumer confidence fell to a nearly two-year low this month, weighed down by a softening labor market and worries over volatility in financial markets and a weaker dollar.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales fell to an annual rate of 5.5 million units, down 4.3% from July, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month's home resales, the lowest since 5.36 million in August 2002, were in line with economists' expectations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The credit-market freeze in August no doubt contributed to the sales decline," said Lawrence Yun, senior economist at the association.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price was $224,500, up 0.2% from a year earlier. The median price in July was $228,700.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately,  <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price index fell in July as 16 of 20 major metropolitan areas saw a decline in annual growth rate.The 10-city composite index fell 4.5% in July from a year earlier, while the 20-city composite index declined 3.9%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun said the unusual disruptions in the mortgage market, including a significant climb in jumbo-loan rates, resulted in a fairly high number of postponed or canceled sales. "Lower sales contributed to a buildup of unsold inventory," he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories rose 0.4% at the end of last month to 4.58 million, a 10-month supply at the current sales pace. There was a 9.5-month supply at the end of July, revised from a previously estimated 9.6 months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales tumbled in all regions. Sales dropped 5.2% in the Midwest, 2% in the Northeast, 9.8% in the West, and 2.7% in the South.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board's consumer-confidence index slid to 99.8 this month from 105.6 in August, leaving the index at its lowest mark since the 98.3 recorded for November 2005.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers' assessments of present-day conditions also fell, dragging that index to 121.7 from 130.1 in August. The index measuring expectations over the next six months fell to 85.2 from August's 89.2.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cutoff date for the survey was Sept. 18, the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates one-half percentage point in an effort to rescue a sagging economy and restore confidence to shaky financial markets.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By Sudeep Reddy and Michael Corkery   </div><div>844 words</div><div>26 September 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market is going into a deeper chill, and consumers are starting to shiver.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes in August fell sharply, and a measure of homes on the market soared to an 18-year-high, according to data released yesterday. One major home builder,  <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc.</span>, is auctioning off homes this weekend with starting prices for some units at 50% off the previous price.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has shaken consumers, raising fresh concerns about economic growth. A key measure of consumer confidence has fallen to its lowest level in almost two years. Retailers such as  <span class="companylink">Lowe's Cos.</span> and  <span class="companylink">Target Corp.</span> said they are feeling the pain.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The combination of all this is indicative of an economy that has lost quite a bit of momentum," said Joshua Shapiro, chief economist at the consulting firm MFR Inc.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street seemed unconcerned. Broad stock indexes moved little yesterday, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is just a few hundred points from its all-time high.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Optimists believe the U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressive move last week to cut interests rates will help keep the economy out of recession. Also, exports are rising, thanks to a weaker dollar, and business investment is holding up better than consumer demand.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the pace of housing's downturn is accelerating, surprising even some bearish analysts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lennar Corp.</span>, the second-largest home builder by volume in the U.S., reported a net loss of $514 million for the quarter ended Aug. 31, well below Wall Street's expectations. The company was forced to write down the value of land and inventory, and write off deposits for land it no longer wants to build on. The write-downs totaled $847.5 million in the quarter. Lennar said it has cut its work force by 35% since last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes tumbled 4.3% in August to an annual pace of 5.5 million, the slowest in five years, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday. More worrisome: The number of homes for sale is enough to satisfy 10 months of demand at the current pace, more than double the supply level the past two years. Analysts cite excess supply in forecasting that an upturn in sales and prices may not come until 2009.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in July fell 3.9% from a year earlier, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price index. The index, which tracks prices in 20 U.S. metropolitan areas, hadn't measured that big a decline since the 1990-91 recession.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bottom is "not yet in sight" for housing, said Mr. Shapiro, the economist. He said the growing number of unsold homes "argues for acclerating declines of prices."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worsening housing slump and turmoil in the credit markets are beginning to take a toll on retailers.  <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> Chief Executive Robert Noblock, addressing analysts and investors at a conference in Charlotte, North Carolina, yesterday, refused to hazard a guess on when the housing slowdown will finally bottom. "The only thing that is consistent is the inaccuracies of the economic forecasts," he said. Late Monday,  <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> reduced its earnings outlook for 2008. Its shares fell 6.7% yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"[T]he credit contraction can impact home-improvement customers on a national scale . . . as consumers hesitate on larger discretionary projects," said Mr. Noblock.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Missed sales forecasts at other typically strong-performing retailers are also rattling investors and market watchers. In August,  <span class="companylink">Costco Wholesale Corp.</span> posted sales growth at U.S. stores open at least a year of 1%, much lower than its original forecast. The company cited weakness in the California region, which has been hard hit by the housing slowdown.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Target, meanwhile, on Monday lowered its estimate for September sales and mentioned in particular soft sales in the Northeast as well as in Florida. It was the first time retailers had pointed to a consumer slowdown in the Northeast.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a report by the Conference Board yesterday of weak consumer confidence in September was led by a steep decline in New England. The Conference Board said its index of consumer confidence dropped to 99.8 in September from 105.6 in August, putting it at the lowest point since November 2005. The survey ended on Sept. 18, the day the Fed lowered interest rates by half a percentage point.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results offered few hopeful signs as consumers appeared increasingly cautious. A smaller share of consumers planned to buy cars or homes, and expectations about economic conditions over the next six months also worsened.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers' mood about the labor market offered the latest indication of a slowdown in hiring that could portend weakness in the September employment figures. The share of consumers reporting jobs as "hard to get" rose to 22.1% from 19.7%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Looking ahead, little economic improvement is expected," said Conference Board economist Lynn Franco.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By Sudeep Reddy </div><div>653 words</div><div>20 September 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Consumer prices fell in August, offering some support for the Federal Reserve's rate cut Tuesday, but there are signs some investors are worried inflation could stir in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, housing starts and permits tumbled last month as the sector took the full brunt of the credit crunch. Some economists noted that a drop in construction will help trim bloated inventories of unsold homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consumer-price index fell 0.1% in August from a month earlier, the first decline since October 2006, the Labor Department said yesterday. It was up 2% from a year earlier. Plummeting gasoline prices more than offset a rise in food prices. However, a recent jump in crude-oil prices points to higher inflation this fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose 0.2% last month, and was up just 2.1% from a year earlier, the lowest core inflation rate since March 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inflation reading should reassure Fed officials, who on Tuesday cut the short-term interest-rate target a half percentage point to 4.75%. The move, while applauded by those worried about economic growth, also fueled concerns about a potential rise in inflation. The anxieties were reflected in the decline of the dollar and the rise in yields on long-term government bonds, which would lose value if inflation picks up. Prices of inflation-indexed bonds also reflected slightly higher expected inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In lowering interest rates, the central bank's policy committee said it was acting to forestall deeper economic damage from a credit crunch that plunged markets into turmoil over the last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Fed statement said "some inflation risks remain," the assessment focused less on inflation than it did in prior months. The shift in emphasis reflected concern about growth -- as well as the fact that slower growth will make it harder for companies to raise prices and for wages to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some analysts said several factors could push up prices in the coming year, including rising labor costs, a falling dollar -- which makes imports more expensive -- and higher commodity prices. "The risks are clearly to the upside, but the Fed is making a judgment here that the growth risks are more pronounced right now," said <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co.</span> economist Haseeb Ahmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest data suggest the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the price index for personal consumption expenditures, later this month will show core inflation again within the 1%-to-2% comfort zone of some Fed officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest housing numbers show the housing market's woes worsening as the credit-market troubles unfolded, indicating the sector could continue declining well into next year. Housing starts fell 2.6% in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.33 million homes, the Commerce Department said. Starts are off 42% from their January 2006 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, housing starts are at a 12-year low, while starts on single-family units last month hit the lowest point since March 1993. The National Association of Home Builders this week said that its September index of market activity, gauging builders' moods about current conditions, matched the all-time low reached in January 1991.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits for new construction, an indicator of the market's direction in coming months, tumbled 5.9% to 1.31 million units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As miserable as the downturn has been, it is likely to take a turn for the worse over the second half of the year because of the recent turmoil in financial markets," Global Insight economist Patrick Newport said in a note to clients.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington -- U.S. CONSUMER PRICES were under wraps last month on falling energy and apparel prices and tame housing costs, giving Federal Reserve officials some measure of support for their surprisingly aggressive rate reduction Tuesday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, home construction slowed to the lowest rate in 12 years during August, and permits for future groundbreakings also fell, suggesting a continuing U.S. housing slump.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consumer-price data, which come on the heels of a steep drop in August wholesale prices, suggest that underlying inflation worries shouldn't stand in the way of future rate cuts if the economic outlook erodes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consumer-price index fell 0.1% in August from July, the Labor Department said yesterday, its first decline since October 2006. The CPI rose 0.1% in July. The core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose a modest 0.2%. Wall Street economists had expected no change in overall consumer prices and a 0.2% rise in the core index.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall consumer inflation was up 2% from a year earlier. The core CPI was up 2.1% compared with the same month a year earlier, down slightly from July and matched the lowest annual rate since September 2005. That is near the 2% top end of the Federal Reserve's assumed comfort zone for annual core inflation. The Fed's preferred gauge -- the core price index for personal-consumption expenditures -- is within that zone at 1.9% annual growth through July.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the Fed lowered the federal-funds rate for the first time in more than four years to stem the effects of a housing and credit crunch, by a half percentage point to 4.75%, even though officials cautioned that "some inflation risks remain" and that they "will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists took that inflation warning as an empty threat, given the size of the rate cut.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts declined 2.6% to a seasonally adjusted 1.331 million annual rate, after falling 6.9% in July to 1.367 million, the Commerce Department said yesterday. Originally, Commerce reported July starts 6.1% lower at 1.381 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median forecast of 23 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires was a 3.7% drop in August to a 1.330 million annual rate. The retreat carried starts to their lowest level since 1.281 million in June 1995. Year over year, housing starts were 19.1% below the level in August 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mood of U.S. home builders hit bottom this month, a report released on Tuesday indicated. The National Association of Home Builders' index for sales of new, single-family homes decreased to 20 from 22 in August, tying a record low set in January 1991.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have plenty to feel bad about: sales have plunged, mortgage rates have risen, credit has tightened and cancellations of new-home contracts have increased, adding to already bloated inventory.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is hardly surprising that builder sentiment is very poor," MFR Inc. economist Joshua Shapiro wrote in a note to clients about the NAHB report. "We look for activity levels to continue to slide in the months ahead and for pricing to erode further."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an omen, yesterday's housing-starts data showed that building permits tumbled 5.9% to a 1.307 million annual rate in August. Economists had expected permits to drop 3.4% to a rate of 1.342 million. July permits fell 1.7% to 1.389 million. Permits are an indicator of future building activity.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the nation's housing market in a slump and the mortgage market in disarray, many home builders are putting up fewer supersize homes and offering smaller floor plans. That seems to be what buyers suddenly want in an era of high prices and tougher financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Financing has tightened down so much that many people aren't able to qualify for the larger houses," said Kathryn Boyce, an account executive in Northern California for Boston-based real-estate research firm Hanley Wood Market Intelligence. "Throughout the U.S. people can't afford what they previously did. Floor plans are going to get smaller."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales have plunged over the past year, leaving builders saddled with excess inventory, especially of larger, more expensive homes. In July, new-home sales were running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 870,000 units, down sharply from 1.3 million in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, turmoil in the mortgage market has made it harder for buyers to qualify for bigger loans. As lending standards get stiffer, lenders have cut back on mortgages exceeding $417,000. That's the maximum size loan that lenders can sell to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored financiers that buy mortgages from lenders and repackage them into mortgage bonds for sale to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this is causing builders to redraw their blueprints. After reducing prices on their current inventories of unsold homes, the next step is to "start building to a new market. That new market is a lower price point at a smaller size. To the extent they can do it, they will," said Kermit Baker, chief economist at the American Institute of Architects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past three decades, prosperity and a demand for space to accommodate home theaters, offices, gyms and palatial kitchens has pushed up the average size of newly constructed single-family homes by nearly 45% even as the size of the average family has declined. Last year, according to the Census Bureau, the median size of a newly completed single-family home reached 2,248 square feet, up from 1,560 square feet in 1974.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expansion continued into the first quarter of this year, with the median home size inching up to a near-record 2,302 square feet. But it slipped to 2,241 square feet in the second quarter, and many analysts think a broader decline may be in the offing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Mezger, chief executive of Los Angeles-based KB Home, said the change has been "driven by data on what our home buyers want and what they can afford in a new home." Mr. Mezger estimates that the average size of a newly built KB Home today is 2,200 square feet, 200 square feet less than before the shift in sentiment took hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for Centex Corp., which is based in Dallas, said that in some of its developments Centex is scaling down the size of its homes or their amenities to put them within reach of more buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Toll Brothers Inc., known for its sprawling suburban "McMansions," recognizes that buyers may want smaller homes. Kira McCarron, the company's chief marketing officer, said Toll doesn't track home size, but she concedes that there "probably is more demand for 3,000- versus 6,000-square-foot," homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. McCarron added, however, that for Toll's high-end buyers, the issue isn't so much cost. "It's not that people don't want or can't afford [big houses]. It's that they're afraid of them now -- it's a confidence issue more than an affordability issue."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, home builders are making the shift to smaller, less costly homes in existing subdivisions, angering homeowners who bought large homes during an earlier stage of the project's development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Raidman, 37 years old, moved into his 2,760-square-foot lake-front home in Fort Pierce, Fla., last fall in the first phase of a gated community developed by Lennar Corp. of Miami. Mr. Raidman said he was told that his home would be surrounded by similarly sized and priced homes. But when he heard Lennar was planning to build much smaller homes in his neighborhood, he and other homeowners fought the company's plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Lennar agreed not to build the smallest of its new models -- at just 1,326 square feet -- next to the larger ones, the home builder has continued with its plans to downsize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our biggest concern is what it would do to the value of our homes," said Mr. Raidman, who doubts he can sell his home today for the $300,000 he paid for it last year. Standing on his back porch, he can look out across the lake and see at least six newer, smaller homes. "The garage looks bigger than the house," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulte Homes Inc., based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., is also offering buyers less costly alternatives within its existing communities. "The base price that we start with when we release a new phase might be lower than what the base price was in the previous phase," Pulte Chief Operating Officer Steve Petruska said in a conference call with investors in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulte said it expects its average selling price for the third quarter of this year to be $331,000, down from $335,000 last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while home builders are aware that customers increasingly want smaller, cheaper homes -- and in some cases can't afford anything else -- building those homes eats into their profits, often because of the high price they paid for the land the homes are built on. That leaves them having to hope for higher sales volume to offset their reduced margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some welcome the downsizing trend, including author Sarah Susanka. Since 1997 Ms. Susanka has written several best-selling books extolling the virtues of "The Not-So-Big House," and she says she has recently been attracting more interest from home builders. "I used to be asked all the time why would anybody want to downsize? People thought I was crazy," she said. "Now it's becoming much more mainstream." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Levy is worried about the health of the housing market in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if you haven't heard of him or are simply tired of hearing about anything having to do with housing, Mr. Levy is a man who should be listened to. Senior economist at the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto, Calif., which he co-founded more than 35 years ago, Mr. Levy has seen more than his share of cycles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This cycle doesn't look like it is going to end well, he says. His reasoning is deceptively simple: "There's a limit to what people can afford." When the coastal areas of the state were reporting home prices that seemed unrealistically high in the late 1990s, Mr. Levy was among those who thought prices throughout the state, on average, could go even higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The centerpiece of his theory at the time was that prices remained below or in line with the national average in places such as Sacramento, Riverside and Fresno. "People would say, 'It's a long commute, but I can get a good home,'" Mr. Levy says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, fueled by what Mr. Levy terms "bizarre mortgages," home prices have ballooned to 80% more than the national average in some of these markets. The median home price in the state -- recent price declines, notwithstanding -- hovered at $586,000 as of late July, according to the latest figures from California Association of Realtors. That is more than double the national average of $228,900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is where Mr. Levy's thoughts about affordability come into play. For many Americans, creative mortgages or not, a purchase price of a few hundred thousand dollars with a small down payment using conventional financing is a lot of money. So is the $1 million-plus to be paid for the privilege of living a few feet from neighboring homes in a tract development in many parts of the state -- where housing already is considered by some observers to be in a recession, as defined by sharp drops in the level of new construction and sales activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bigger economic upheaval, Mr. Levy says, "isn't about foreclosures," which are making the headlines now, "it's about the spending behavior of those who aren't going to lose homes but have seen their wealth evaporate." Either they don't have as much home equity to borrow against, he says, or they are afraid to spend as they watch the value of their home decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From their peak, home prices in California's fastest-growing areas have fallen 6% to 11%. For a while, the so-called wealth effect of that decline was offset by the rising stock market. "But the stock market is coming back to earth," Mr. Levy says. At one point in August, in intraday trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 10% from its 14000.41 record close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making matters worse, he says, the first baby boomers turn 62 years old next year. They will be retiring soon and may want to sell their homes to downsize. As long as home prices remain at such lofty levels, California could have a hard time recruiting replacements who like the idea of homeownership, especially first-time buyers. "That's where this hits the economy," Mr. Levy says. "It will be hard to attract new people and firms to the state," which has seen a slow net migration in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even multiple cuts in the Federal Reserve's target federal-funds rate, he argues, won't necessarily help until prices become more rational. With 10.7 months of unsold inventory, not counting homes that would be on the market if sellers thought there would be buyers, he believes Californians can expect another few years of difficulty, depending on the speed of this housing correction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why should non-Californians care about the California housing market, especially when the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index shows year-over-year increases in such cities as Charlotte, N.C., Portland, Ore., and Seattle? Because the Golden State accounts for 13% of the country's gross domestic product -- or the total value of all goods and services produced -- nearly double the No. 2 contributor, New York. That means that what happens in California, home to such growth industries as high-tech, biotech, venture capital and film, doesn't necessarily stay in California. The impact of slow economic growth, or even recession, in the state will ripple through the rest of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California, alone, wouldn't be enough to put the country into a recession, Mr. Levy says. "What would be serious would be if there are other markets like California." And based on prices well above the average in places like New York, Boston and Boulder, Colo., and the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area, we know there are.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sudeep Reddy   </div><div>586 words</div><div>31 August 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. economic growth surged in the second quarter, thanks to an increase in exports and stronger business investment. But tepid consumer spending and weakening housing activity suggest the expansion will slow significantly into next year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, jobless claims jumped to their highest total in four months, signaling a further softening of the American labor market on the heels of job cuts in the mortgage-finance sector.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tightening credit and August's volatility in financial markets are expected to add to strains on the economy in the second half.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Up until this point, you could say that the economy has withstood the housing downturn very well," said Global Insight economist Nigel Gault. "But the deeper the housing downturn goes, the more likely it is that eventually we'll see some broader spillover to the rest of the economy."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Commerce Department said Thursday that the economy grew at an annual rate of 4% in the second quarter, up from its previous estimate of 3.4%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shrinking trade imbalance -- due to both higher exports and lower imports -- accounted for much of the gain. Huge growth in commercial construction helped offset sharp declines in new-home construction. Corporate profits showed the strongest growth in a year, rising more than 6% from the first quarter.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased just 1.4% in the quarter.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The consumer is still in the dumps, and early indications for the summer are that household spending has not picked up," Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors Inc. said in a note to clients.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before the latest market volatility, the second-quarter growth spurt wasn't expected to last. Much of the growth came as the result of a rebound from an especially weak first quarter, when the economy nearly stalled, expanding at an anemic 0.6%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic growth is expected to be sharply lower in the coming months as some components of the second-quarter rebound -- such as defense spending and commercial construction -- begin to weaken. Economists at  <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.</span> expect growth to slow to 3% in the third quarter, then drop to 2% in the fourth. Global Insight forecasts growth at 1.5% to 2% from the fourth quarter through the second quarter of 2008.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The softness has raised worries about spending in the second half. The downturn in the U.S. subprime-mortgage market spurred the latest market turmoil and added to risks of higher delinquency rates on consumer loans.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The troubles spreading through the mortgage-finance sector are also starting to affect broader labor-market indicators. Mortgage-lending firms cut more than 20,000 jobs just in August, as the subprime business unravels.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial claims for unemployment compensation rose 9,000 in the week ended Aug. 25 to a seasonally adjusted 334,000, the highest since April, the Labor Department said Thursday. Over the past year, a strong labor market has underpinned the U.S. economy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This could be the first signal that we're actually going to get a bit more obvious slowdown in the labor market than we've had so far," said Mr. Gault of Global Insight. Still, he said, "it may be that we get a wave of financial-market layoffs, and then things settle down again."   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. sales of existing homes fell slightly in July, but a surge in inventories set the stage for a steeper slump and sharper price declines in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the credit crisis that hit financial markets this month, U.S. home sales are expected to drop further as tighter lending standards and a pullback by mortgage firms keep potential buyers on the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharply rising inventories are a sign of homeowners trying to sell their homes before prices tumble more, said Joseph Brusuelas, chief U.S. economist at consulting firm IDEAglobal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are going to be no happy endings here," he added. "It's the last days of the old order."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales slipped 0.2% in July to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 5.75 million homes, the lowest in five years, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday. The median sales price dropped to $228,900, down 0.6% from the July 2006 level, which was the highest on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of homes for sale jumped 5.1% to 4.59 million, or about 9.6 months of supply at the current sales pace. A supply of about six months generally indicates a balanced market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tightening of credit markets became most severe in mid-August. That means the full effect may not be seen until sales figures for September are released. The Realtor group's figures reflect transaction closings, which mark the end of the buying process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problems may be most acute in the markets for lower-end homes, which tend to go to less credit-worthy borrowers, and for higher-end homes that require buyers to take out so-called jumbo loans. Rates for such loans, which exceed $417,000, jumped sharply this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before the market turmoil, inventories were expected to rise sharply into early next year as homeowners increasingly default on loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers could face price declines of as much as 10% in the next six months as the market settles, said Joshua Shapiro, chief economist at consultancy MFR Inc. in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To sell cheaper homes, prices need to be slashed even more because demand is falling off," Mr. Shapiro said. "If the bottom is falling out of the lower end of the market, it's going to have to affect the middle, which affects everything above it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales increased 2.8% in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 870,000, government data last week showed. Such sales also are expected to decline as a result of tightening credit and slower activity by builders. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. factory orders and housing may have been gaining momentum before the latest turmoil in credit markets clouded the nation's economic outlook.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If there's going to be some downward pressure here, which we think there probably will be, it's better to have some momentum going into it," Global Insight economist Brian Bethune said.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Factory orders and housing may have been picking up momentum before the latest turmoil in credit markets clouded the economic outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for durable goods, those expected to last more than three years, surged in July, and an important gauge of capital spending turned up, according to government data released Friday. Sales of newly built homes perked up, too, though that could be a temporary flicker of life in a sagging market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If there's going to be some downward pressure here, which we think there probably will be, it's better to have some momentum going into it," said Global Insight economist Brian Bethune. "If you already were dead in the water, it obviously would be much more serious."</p>

The increase in sales was driven by strong demand in the West, while the Northeast market, the smallest for new homes, fell sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of sales for new homes dropped 10.2% in July from a year earlier. Inventories, while declining slightly, remained high at 7.5 months of supply at the current sales rate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forecast to Show 1% Rise</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Durable-goods orders, a leading indicator of manufacturing activity, are forecast to show a rise of 1% for July, although without transportation, the gain may be more like 0.5%. Autos and housing have been dampers; exports a plus. Commerce Department, 8:30 a.m. EDT.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are We at the Bottom Yet?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Sales Seen Slipping</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes likely slid further in July, as tighter lending standards are making it harder to get a mortgage -- and fewer shoppers have the stomach to buy. Consensus forecast: a 1.4% drop to annual rate of 822,000. Commerce Department, 10 a.m. EDT.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Add real estate agents to the growing list of victims of the slumping U.S. housing market -- although they know few tears will be shed for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors expects membership rolls to decline this year for the first time in a decade. The group ended 2006 with nearly 1.4 million members -- almost double the roughly 716,000 it had in 1997 -- but expects 2007 to close with 1.3 million, a drop of more than 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents' ranks continued to rise even after the market began to cool about two years ago because of the 18-month lag between the downturn in sales and membership, says NAR spokesman Walter Molony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trade groups in two of the hardest-hit states -- California and Florida -- also forecast membership drops. The California Association of Realtors is expecting its first decline since 1997, forecasting a year-end tally of 185,000 members compared with more than 199,000 last year. The Florida Association of Realtors currently has about 154,000 members compared with more than 161,000 last year at this time, but expects flat membership by year end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colleen Badagliacco, president of the California group and in the business since 1980, says many agents joining the last three years wanted to cash in on a hot market but weren't prepared to endure what she calls the "ugly perfect storm" that attracted more agents than a sagging market can support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, applicants can get a conditional real-estate license after taking one class, a loophole that will close after Sept. 30 when three classes will be required.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You had very inexperienced people doing very expensive transactions," Ms. Badagliacco said. "There is the opportunity to make a lot of money, but the downside is there are a lot of fixed expenses whether you're earning money or not."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fixed expenses include advertising and marketing, and everyday costs, such as gasoline in the car.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While new-home construction tumbled in July to the lowest pace in a decade, supplies remain high and demand keeps dropping -- giving the market more room to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest credit tightening also may halt some mortgage lending and keep more buyers on the sidelines, pushing the housing market down further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have a classic inventory problem," said IDEAglobal chief U.S. economist Joseph Brusuelas. "There's far too much supply out there in the market, especially in the new-home sector. Prices are going to have to adjust."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 6.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.38 million, 21% below the level a year earlier, the Commerce Department said. Permits for new construction dropped 2.8% to an annualized 1.37 million units, the lowest since late 1996. Housing completions slid 0.1% to 1.51 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trouble among lenders and tightening credit markets are expected to feed the declines in coming months by limiting the availability of mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have to assume that at least some people are getting caught in the crossfire when trying to buy a home," said Michael Englund, chief economist at Action Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts on single-family homes dropped 7.3% to an annual pace of 1.07 million, 42% below their peak in January 2006. Starts on multifamily units, such as those used as rental properties, declined 1.6%. The declines were sharpest in the South, where building activity was especially strong last year. July starts in the region fell 11%, while in the West they were down 3.7%, and in the Northeast by 1.3%. In the Midwest, however, construction increased 2.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall housing starts should decline 20% from the July pace during the first half of next year, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> economist David Greenlaw wrote to clients. "It's clear that if prime borrowers' access to mortgage credit remains restricted for any significant length of time, the slowdown in starts will be longer and deeper than previously anticipated."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weak housing market is expected to weigh on economic growth in the second half as demand falls for construction materials, appliances and home furnishings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, jobless claims last week increased to a two-month high, a further sign of a softening labor market after the unemployment rate ticked up last month. The number of workers filing initial claims for jobless benefits rose 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 322,000, the Labor Department said. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home builders in the U.S. slowed groundbreakings during July, pulling construction to its lowest rate in 10 years as sales keep tumbling and credit tightens, a government report said Thursday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts decreased 6.1% to a seasonally adjusted 1.381 million annual rate, after rising 2.1% in June to 1.470 million, the Commerce Department said. Originally, the department reported June starts 2.3% higher at 1.467 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July starts were lower than Wall Street had predicted. The median forecast of 22 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires was a 4.6% drop to a 1.400 million annual rate. It was the lowest level of starts since 1.355 million in January 1997.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year-to-year, housing starts were 20.9% below the level in July 2006. Falling demand for new homes and bloated inventories are discouraging builders. They are also worried about tight credit, a fear that has rattled financial markets in the past week and led central banks around the globe to rush in with injections of liquidity.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, the National Association of Home Builders said its August survey found members' confidence at the lowest since 1991.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The decline in builder confidence is consistent with our outlook for further construction cuts and a prolonged housing recession,"  <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> said in a note to clients Wednesday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve released a survey on Monday examining credit conditions in the U.S. Of the 16 domestic banks surveyed that originate subprime loans, 56% said they have tightened standards on those loans. Of those originating nontraditional mortgages, including adjustable-rate and interest-only mortgages, 40% said they had tightened credit standards. The quarterly study of senior loan officers said demand for many types of commercial and consumer loans has weakened in the past three months. And 38% of survey respondents reported weaker demand for prime mortgages; 44% of subprime issuers reported weaker demand.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The subprime crisis is behind an anxiety that some label a "credit crunch." Fears abound that more and more lenders will grow wary. The phenomenon has been described as a financial contagion leading to a restriction on the availability of credit in world financial markets. The roots of the crisis are in the high-cost money that lenders doled to borrowers with bad credit who wanted to purchase homes. Rising interest rates and falling property values drove up defaults and foreclosures among these homeowners. That caused some lenders to shut down and cost investors billions of dollars in securities tied to subprime mortgage assets. Analysts see an unpleasant impact on the slumping housing market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prospects for future sales remain grim given credit problems in the mortgage market," Lehman's note said. "Builders fear that tighter lending standards and the liquidity squeeze in the mortgage market will limit mortgage availability, further restraining sales."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's data contained a sign things will get worse: building permits fell 2.8% to a 1.373 million annual rate in July. Economists expected permits to drop 0.6% to a rate of 1.405 million. June permits fell 7.0% to 1.413 million. Permits are an indicator of future building activity.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likely to Continue Decline</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market likely continues its slump, with July housing starts seen falling 4.6% and building permits down 0.6%.

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Simon </div><div>1760 words</div><div>16 August 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp;Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly payment on a $500,000 30-year fixed-rate loan would jump by more than $340 to $3,669 if the loan carried an interest rate of 8% instead of 7%. A Personal Journal article yesterday incorrectly said the monthly payment would jump to $3,802.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ Aug. 17, 2007)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END) </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher mortgage rates are beginning to put the squeeze on many borrowers with good credit who thought they were insulated from the subprime market's woes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates for "jumbo" mortgages made to prime borrowers have jumped to 7.64% from a recent low of 6.87% in early July, according to HSH Associates, as problems with subprime mortgages ripple through the broader market. That's increasing costs for many home buyers, and could put pressure on home prices in some of the nation's most-expensive markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jumbo mortgages are loans that exceed the $417,000 limit for those eligible for purchase and guarantee by mortgage institutions Fannie Mae and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jumbo loans aren't just for the ultrawealthy. In high-cost markets such as Los Angeles, New York and Washington, they are commonplace for many people looking to buy an ordinary home. Rates on these loans have jumped in response to nervousness on the part of investors who buy jumbo mortgages after they've been packaged into securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response, some buyers are retreating to the sidelines. Others are using creative strategies to lessen the impact of higher borrowing costs or are finding they can still get a reasonably good mortgage rate, provided they shop around. Some sellers, meanwhile, are cutting prices to make it easier for would-be buyers to qualify for a lower-cost loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The turmoil in the jumbo market is particularly notable because rates for smaller "conforming" loans -- those eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> -- had edged downward in recent weeks and now stand at 6.69%. As a result, the gap between the prices of jumbo and conforming mortgages has widened to 0.77 percentage point, according to HSH Associates. That's up from a recent low of 0.17 percentage point and well above the 0.24-percentage-point average since 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher rates for jumbo loans could well hurt home sales because they translate into higher costs for borrowers. The monthly payment on a $500,000 30-year fixed-rate loan, for example, would jump by more than $340 to $3,802 if the loan carried an interest rate of 8% instead of 7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's too early to tell just how great the impact will be, however. August is typically a slow month for home sales, and the pressures could be short-lived if the jumbo market's troubles subside soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet there are already signs that the rate increase is rattling some would-be buyers and causing some sellers to rethink their strategies. Linda Baron, an agent with Prudential Fox &amp;Roach, Realtors in the Philadelphia suburb of Blue Bell, Pa., says she has seen some of the more expensive homes in her area come off the market and prices for others drop in response to the recent uptick in jumbo rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's gotten "very quiet in the last two weeks," she says. "I think buyers are regrouping." A buyer for one of her properties wanted to walk away from a large deposit at the last minute after jumbo rates shot up, she says, but then realized his mortgage rate was locked in at an attractive 6.75%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Santa Clara County, Calif., where jumbo loans dominate the market, the number of homes sold dropped 25% in the past two weeks, says Richard Calhoun, broker-owner of Creekside Realty. Mr. Calhoun says he is telling buyers who need a jumbo loan that "they are probably better off waiting until rates come down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest troubles come as home prices have flattened or fallen in many areas and sales have stalled. Home prices will drop 2.9% this year and 5.7% next year, according to estimates by <span class="companylink">Fiserv Inc.</span> unit <span class="companylink">Fiserv Lending Solutions</span> and <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. Many of the metro areas that experienced home-price bubbles also have large numbers of jumbo-mortgage originations, notes David Stiff, chief economist of <span class="companylink">Fiserv Lending Solutions</span>, and will likely be among the weakest markets going forward. The National Association of Realtors said yesterday that existing home sales in the second quarter fell 10.8% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some home sellers are lowering their asking prices to make it easier for would-be buyers to get a lower-cost mortgage. Alan Vallillo, a property manager, dropped the price of his three-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath condo in Trumbull, Conn., by $20,000 to $549,000 last weekend. The lower price will make it easier for a buyer with a down payment of roughly 25% to qualify for a conforming loan, says Mr. Vallillo's broker, David D'Ausilio of Re/Max Heritage in Westport, Conn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, Mr. Vallillo, who plans to move into a new home in late September, is offering to buy down the interest rate on the buyer's mortgage loan by two percentage points in the first year and one percentage point in year two. He says he hopes the interest rate buy-down will "spur [someone] to drop the price on their home so they can buy mine."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason Godfroy, a teacher, recently set a $465,000 asking price for his four-bedroom colonial in Adamstown, Md., on the advice of his agent, John MacArthur. "To get people in, [they] had to be able to get a conforming loan" and not a jumbo mortgage, Mr. Godfroy says. With 10% down, "that puts you at $418,500."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers are trying to use the rate increase as a bargaining chip. Jane Powers, a broker with Ewing &amp;Clark Inc. in Seattle, says that one of her clients recently offered $1.7 million for a waterfront home listed at $1.995 million -- and also asked the seller to provide financing. The buyer, who is self-employed, said that he was likely to need a loan that didn't require him to document his income, which is getting tougher to find. "He was using it as leverage to try and get better terms," Ms. Powers says. "It didn't work."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Stevens, who runs the mortgage-lending operation for <span class="companylink">Long &amp;Foster Real Estate</span>, based in Fairfax, Va., says he has "been fielding an unending series of phone calls" from agents who've been spooked by the troubles in the jumbo mortgage market. Mr. Stevens says he is telling agents that "financing is available, but is more limited" than it was a year ago, and the variations in pricing are greater. "It's incumbent on the home buyer as well as the real-estate agent to do their shopping," he says. He's also advising jumbo borrowers to lock in a rate now in case the sector's troubles last longer than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage brokers and real-estate executives say the news in the jumbo market isn't as gloomy as some may think, particularly for those with good credit who can document their income and assets. Although some lenders have raised their rates for jumbo 30-year fixed-rate loans to 8% or more, borrowers with good credit can still find loans for 7% or less from lenders looking to boost market share. "It's as though there are two mortgage markets out there," says Melissa Cohn, a mortgage broker in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Determining which lender is offering the best deal can be tricky, as pricing and loan terms are changing daily. Making matters even more complicated, lenders such as <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp;Co.</span> are offering better terms for jumbo loans originated by their retail branches and real-estate broker partners than those originated by mortgage brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate firms that operate their own mortgage units say they are bringing more deals in-house and looking for alternative sources of financing. When deals don't close because the lender backs out, "we are bringing those people to our mortgage broker and we're able to fund them in 48 hours," says Jeff Barnett, vice president of Alain Pinel Realtors in Los Gatos, Calif. Lawrence Flick IV, chief executive of Prudential Fox &amp;Roach, says he's been looking to local savings and loans and local banks to fund more of the jumbo loans his firm originates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some would-be buyers are looking for creative ways to get around the higher rates. Joe and Sara Safdie, both college professors, have good credit and enough money for a 20% down payment on a home in San Diego in the mid-to-high $600,000 price range. But when the couple checked on mortgage rates last week, they were "appalled" by some of the quotes, Mr. Safdie says. To lower borrowing costs, the couple has decided to put 20% down, take out a $417,000 mortgage and finance the balance with a home-equity loan. "We have our financing in place," says Mr. Safdie. "If a house comes up, we can move quickly. If it doesn't, we'll wait a little longer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other buyers are crossing their fingers and hoping rates will drop soon. Last week, Chris Smith, an agent with Baird &amp;Warner, accepted an offer for a builder selling a five-bedroom, 5 1/2-bath home in East Wilmette, Ill., that was listed at $1.9 million and had been on the market for nearly a year. The buyer, who was the backup bidder and hadn't locked in a mortgage rate, is delaying the closing until Sept. 30 in the hopes that rates will move down in the next month or so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher rates aren't the only problem. Some jumbo borrowers are running into trouble as lenders pull back on loans with little or no documentation, boost their down-payment requirements and increase their scrutiny of appraisals. Martha Burgoon of Century 21 Superstars says one of her clients recently purchased a $1.05 million home in Coto de Caza, Calif., after an earlier deal to buy a $1.14 million home fell through because the appraisal came in too low. "The appraisal issue shows the fear in the lending industry," says Ms. Burgoon.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes on the market in 18 major U.S. metropolitan areas rose slightly in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total listings in those metro areas at the end of July increased 1.2% from a month earlier, according to ZipRealty Inc., a real-estate brokerage based in Emeryville, Calif. The data cover all listings of single-family homes, condominiums and town houses on local multiple-listing services in those areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories increased 19% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The July data indicate that the supply of unsold homes -- while still large enough to weigh on prices in most areas -- is no longer increasing rapidly. That could change, however, as foreclosures add homes to the market and as severely tightened lending standards make it much harder for many people to get loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest increase in supply was in the Seattle metro area, up 6.1% in July. Until recently, the supply of Seattle area homes on the market was lean, and the Seattle market has been strong while most of the rest of the country has slumped over the past two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now "we're seeing a significant slowdown in Seattle," said Pat Lashinsky, chief executive of ZipRealty. Sellers generally have been reluctant to trim their asking prices, he said, and "buyers are sitting on the sidelines, trying to figure out what's going on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While inventories continue to rise in most areas, the Boston metro area showed a decline of 2.8% in July from a month before. In early 2005, Boston was one of the first markets to start cooling after the housing boom of the first half of the decade. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael Corkery </div><div>709 words</div><div>9 August 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc.</span>, a builder of luxury homes, said its home-building revenue fell 21% in the fiscal third quarter ended July 31, as cancellations rose from the previous quarter and buyer traffic in some of its communities fell to the lowest levels the company has seen. The Horsham, Pa., company also warned that tightening mortgage standards could slow sales even further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the near term, tightening credit standards for borrowers should reduce the pool of potential buyers: Liquidity and affordability issues may impede some customers from closing, while others may find it more difficult to sell their existing homes," Chief Executive Robert Toll said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll is scheduled to report earnings for the quarter on Aug. 22.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Toll's preliminary report for the quarter was grim, the company managed to generate more revenue than some analysts had expected, and reported stronger cash flow and lower debt levels than many other large builders. Toll's stock rose $1.38, or 6%, to $24.33 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, amid a broad rally of builder stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say Toll's report may have assuaged fears roiling Wall Street that some large home builders could file for bankruptcy protection, but it gave little indication that the housing market was recovering. Shares of home builders such as Atlanta-based <span class="companylink">Beazer Homes USA Inc.</span>, up almost 25% in 4 p.m. trading, may have benefited from short covering. "You had a situation where a little good news could send these stocks skyrocketing," Morningstar analyst Eric Landry said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> has a very small number of subprime buyers, 43% of its buyers use so-called Alt-A loans, a category between prime and subprime. Lenders have severely tightened standards on such loans in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"During the third quarter, we did not see any significant change in scheduling or cancelations as a result of mortgage problems, compared to the prior quarter," Toll's chief financial officer, Joel Rassman, told analysts. "However, the mortgage [market] continued to deteriorate through the quarter, so the end of the quarter was clearly a little bit more difficult than the beginning."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company added that in the most recent quarter it didn't face increased difficulty selling the mortgages that it originates through its in-house mortgage unit to investors on the secondary market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll's cancellation rate rose to 23.8% from 18.9% the previous quarter. The average home price in the third quarter was $658,000, below the previous forecast of $665,000 to $675,000, Mr. Rassman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Toll noted "stabilization" in markets such as Washington, northern Virginia and parts of Maryland, and even some improvement in Connecticut. But he said markets such as suburban New York, Las Vegas and Raleigh, N.C., worsened. Mr. Toll rated most markets in Florida an "F" for flunk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors added to the gloom yesterday, revising its forecast for existing and new-home sales again. The trade group said sales of existing homes are expected to slump 6.8% this year, not the 5.6% it had previously forecast. The prospects for sales of newly built houses are even bleaker, with the NAR saying they are likely to fall 19% this year. That is a deeper dive than the 17.7% drop the group had previously expected for the year. Meanwhile, the number of homes on the market in 18 major U.S. metropolitan areas rose slightly in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Toll spotted slivers of hope. At the start of the quarter, the company had "the lowest traffic on a per community basis that we have had ever," he said. But the CEO was surprised at the number of deposits the company received toward the end of the quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That gives me hope that there's significant pent-up demand," Mr. Toll told analysts. He said those sales were partly fueled by people "who just can't stand it anymore and have to make a move."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jeff D. Opdyke  </div><div>1445 words</div><div>9 August 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the housing market looking increasingly frail, home builders and real-estate agents are going to new extremes to attract buyers, dangling lavish incentives and slashing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Boca Raton, Fla., Gordon Homes is offering to pay two years of property taxes and insurance -- worth as much as $150,000 on houses priced as high as $2.5 million -- for buyers of completed homes at its upscale Azura development. In Richmond, Va., <span class="companylink">Orleans Homebuilders Inc.</span> is offering "Sizzling Summer Sale Savings" that include as much as $100,000 off the cost of upgrades ranging from granite countertops to a conservatory. And in Medford, Ore., Diane Adams, a real-estate agent, is offering to pay four months of mortgage payments on the $975,000 house she and her home-builder husband constructed on 20 acres near Crater Lake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'd also negotiate a lower price, too," says Ms. Adams, an agent with Re/Max International Inc. "I just want this house off our books."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the country, the theme is the same: Home builders and home sellers are juicing their efforts to unload single-family homes. Among other things, they are offering buyers cash discounts of as much as 20%, throwing in a pool and agreeing to finish basements, garages and other spaces at a cost of several thousand dollars -- incentives much richer than builders were offering as recently as six months ago, when the downturn didn't look as bleak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, home builders have been hit hard as rising mortgage delinquency rates have made lenders much more reluctant to issue new loans, causing home prices to fall and inventories of unsold homes to rise. In June, new-home sales had fallen more than 40% from their peak two years ago, and more than half a million new houses -- nearly eight months of supply -- sit in inventory, according to the most recent report from the National Association of Home Builders. Contract cancellations, meanwhile, have hit nearly 30% for some builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things may not get better for a while. The National Association of Realtors said yesterday that new home sales this year were likely to fall 19% from last year, worse than its previous forecast of a 17.7% drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many builders never expected the housing market to fall this far. Now they're struggling with empty land, too few buyers and an inventory of finished homes that have been sitting empty for months -- and some are growing desperate to free the cash locked up in their real estate by enticing the dwindling number of buyers. The latest survey taken by the National Association of Home Builders indicates that 56% of builders are now offering incentives, up from about 45% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And those incentives are growing bigger. In California's San Diego County, Chris Heller, a real-estate agent with <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span>, says that until about 18 months ago, builders had little reason to offer incentives. Today, he says, "buyers are asking for the moon, and they're often getting it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Heller says that on houses in the $700,000 range, his clients are typically scoring multiple concessions totaling as much as $80,000. Generally, that includes a price reduction, an agreement to pay closing costs or upgraded flooring or appliances -- or a combination of all three.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders in the greater Dallas-Fort Worth area have also been struggling to move homes and are using incentives more freely. "They are giving stuff away here," says Kenneth Cox, a real-estate agent with DFW Urban Realty in Dallas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In suburban Dallas, incentives on single-family homes abound, including price reductions of as much as 20% and free swimming pools. Steve Wall, president of builder Wall Homes Inc., says his company is knocking as much as 18% off the list price for inventory homes in the city's northeast suburbs. For other homes yet to be built, the builder is offering free blinds, a free covered patio and 50% off upgrades, up to $20,000. "It's more competitive than this time last year," Mr. Wall says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This trend toward more-generous incentives is "likely to intensify," says Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com, citing a growing inventory of new homes, an oversupply of pre-owned homes on the market and "a glut of homes that are a year or two old that investors bought as rental property that have never been lived in, and those investors are now trying to sell, too."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Incentives alone often aren't enough to close a sale, however. National builder <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> says that in May, it was offering to pay $5,000 toward closing costs on already completed, or "inventory," homes, up from $1,000 about a year ago, "but we find that these kinds of incentives don't generally work that well," says a spokeswoman. Rowena Emmett, an independent Realtor in La Canada, Calif., says that during Southern California's last downturn, a client offered home buyers a new Porsche, "but that didn't work."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders generally try to avoid outright price markdowns, in part because it angers prior home buyers who don't want prices in their subdivisions forced down. These days, though, builders increasingly resort to price cuts "because it's all about avoiding bankruptcy for some," says Gene Rivers, a Keller Williams agent in Tallahassee, Fla., where builders are offering incentives and price markdowns of as much as 15% of the purchase price on $300,000 and $400,000 houses, double the level of a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly, not every market is struggling. Dianna Kokoszka, a vice president at Austin, Texas-based <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span>, says homes in hot markets such as Austin still receive multiple offers, making incentives unnecessary. In other markets, pockets of strength may still exist, particularly in popular neighborhoods. Jim Napier, president of Napier Realtors ERA, in Richmond, Va., says an agent last week listed a house for $600,000 in a desirable subdivision, "and it sold in two days at the list price, all cash."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, in much of the country, it's a buyer's market. And the savviest buyers are using that to their advantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lummie Jones, a vice president at Napier Realtors, says the best deals go to those who buy inventory homes, can close within 30 days and who have no contingencies in their contracts, such as the need to sell another house or find financing. Those buyers, Ms. Jones says, "are getting concessions of between 5% and 10%" of the house price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, have a preapproval letter in hand, which indicates that a lender is ready to fund your mortgage immediately up to a certain amount, "and tell them to show you the two or three best deals they have," says Mr. Rivers, the Tallahassee agent. Certain houses -- even identical ones -- can have different carrying costs because one needed a special foundation or took longer to build. "That's the house the builder wants off his books first," Mr. Rivers says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Orleans Homebuilders</span>, based in Bensalem, Pa., for instance, has knocked nearly $200,000 off the price of some already built million-dollar homes in Richmond, Va., and is offering an additional $20,000 reduction for buyers who buy inventory homes before Labor Day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For buyers short on cash, builders are offering as much as $10,000 to help cover costs, which can help buyers qualify financially for the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In markets such as Denver and Seattle, builders are increasingly willing to pay agents substantially larger commissions -- as much as 4% of the home's sales price, up from 1.5% or less -- to help unload inventory homes. In turn, some agents are returning some of that money to builders to lower the home price to help buyers qualify for the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Don't be afraid to negotiate for as much as you can these days," says Judy King, a Seattle-area Re/Max agent. "There's a lot of flexibility in a market like this."</p>

  Here are some tips for getting concessions from home builders: 
 
  -- Buy a finished home: Builders want these off their books. 
 
  -- Get a preapproval letter: This shows a builder you have financing 
already in place. 
 
  -- Close quickly: Wrap up a purchase within 30 days; builders want to sell 
before the next bank payment is due. 
 
  -- Avoid contingencies: Don't make your purchase contingent on selling a 
home or finding financing.     </pre>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's homeownership rate has declined to its lowest level since 2003, the latest sign that the mortgage industry's ills are taking a toll on the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New data released by the Census Bureau this month put the share of American households that own their own homes at 68.4% in the second quarter. The homeownership rate, which peaked at 69.4% three years ago, has declined steadily over the last three quarters, on a seasonally adjusted basis. Economists say it could drop further over the next two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homeownership rate fell most sharply for blacks. It dropped 3.4 percentage points over the last three years to 46.3% in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Census Bureau report did contain one bit of good news for the housing market: The number of vacant homes for sale dipped to 2.04 million in the second quarter from a record 2.18 million in the first quarter. "Vacancies are definitely peaking," says Mark Zandi, chief economist of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. But he cautions that the census figures are based on a small sample and can be volatile. "I wouldn't be surprised" if the vacancy rate increases again in the third quarter, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest decline in the homeownership rate comes as mortgage lenders continue to tighten their standards, making it more difficult for people to purchase a home with little or no money down, for example. Among those hit hardest by the latest changes are first-time home buyers, who often have trouble coming up with a down payment. Lenders have also sharply cut back on loans to subprime borrowers, or those with scuffed credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no doubt "that the dip in the homeownership rate . . . is at least partly the result of tighter credit," says Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist. He expects the share of Americans owning their homes to drop to 67% over the next two years in the face of tighter lending standards and rising foreclosures. Some economists say the impact of tighter standards could be at least partially offset by falling home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homeownership rate began climbing in the mid-1990s, propelled by moderate interest rates and strong economic growth. It moved higher still in the first half of this decade, helped along by low interest rates, creative mortgage financing and the desire of many Americans to get in on the housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the share of Americans owning their homes began to dip as declining affordability made it tougher for some would-be buyers to get into the market.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Dawn Wotapka and Michael Corkery </div><div>563 words</div><div>27 July 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders raised fresh concerns about the U.S. housing market, with <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc.</span> and <span class="companylink">Beazer Homes USA Inc.</span> posting sharp losses, while <span class="companylink">WCI Communities Inc.</span> said it can't find a buyer for the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department also said new-home sales dropped for the fifth time in six months in June. Sales of single-family homes fell 6.6%, a larger-than-expected drop, while the national median home price was down 2.2% to $237,900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this indicates the housing recession appears to be getting worse each month, crushing hopes for near-term improvement and raising concerns on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 311.50 points yesterday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is unclear to us when the housing recovery will begin," Donald Tomnitz, chief executive of D.R. Horton, the nation's largest home builder by number of units, told analysts during a conference call yesterday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders, such as Horton and Beazer, which focus on first-time home buyers, said their customers were finding it more difficult to obtain mortgages amid tightening credit standards. The housing malaise also pummeled luxury builder <span class="companylink">WCI Communities.</span> The Bonita Springs, Fla., company, which had put itself up for sale in April, said yesterday that it had received no "definitive proposal" to buy it. WCI executives blamed "deteriorating conditions and uncertainty in the home-building and debt markets" for the challenging sales process. The news sent WCI's stock down 13%, or $1.45, to $9.87 in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faced with slumping demand and a glut of unsold homes, builders are slashing home prices to move inventory. That is helping to trigger charges to their books, as the builders write down the value of real-estate assets. Yesterday, Horton, of Fort Worth, Texas, said its write-offs and charges in the fiscal third quarter, including goodwill impairments, totaled $1.3 billion, the largest of any builder during the downturn. Horton's shares fell 32 cents, or 1.8%, to $17.16 on the Big Board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The picture also was grim for Beazer, which took pretax charges of $188.5 million to write down inventory and goodwill, and forfeit land options. Beazer yesterday reported a fiscal third-quarter loss of $123 million, compared with net income of $102.6 million a year earlier. Revenue fell 37% to $761 million from $1.2 billion. The Atlanta company's shares dropped 8.7%, or $1.48, to $15.56 on the Big Board. Beazer's stock has fallen 67% since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beazer's results follow the company's disclosure Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission has upgraded its informal probe into whether the company or related parties violated any securities laws to the level of a formal investigation. A Federal Bureau of Investigation probe of Beazer's lending practices was made public in March. The company said yesterday that it continues to fully cooperate with those investigations. Also yesterday, Beazer received a $500 million line of credit that is half the size of the one it replaced, signaling a possible tightening of money available to the company and to the building industry.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Durable-goods orders rose in June, but an important barometer of business-capital spending fell, and sales of newly built homes dropped 6.6% last month, the government said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for durable goods, those intended to last at least three years, increased 1.4% after a 2.3% drop in May. Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, an indicator of business-equipment spending, slipped 0.7%, after decreasing 1.5% in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales in June were down 22.3% from a year earlier, and are now at the lowest level since November 2002, according to a Commerce Department survey. Home sales fell sharply in most regions, but rose in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey found builders have a 7.8-month supply of unsold homes on hand at the current sales pace, up from 7.4 months in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said the number of workers filing new claims for jobless benefits fell 2,000 to 301,000 in the week ending July 21. The four-week average, a better gauge of underlying labor-market trends, fell to 308,500 last week from the previous 312,500. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- New-home sales in the U.S. took their fifth fall in six months during June, while a measure of housing inventory rose and the median price dropped, the government said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, demand for durable goods climbed for the fourth time in five months during June, spurred by stronger demand for airplanes, the government said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes decreased by an unexpectedly large 6.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 834,000, the Commerce Department said. May's new-home sales fell 2.2% to an annual rate of 893,000; originally, the government said May sales dropped 1.6% to 915,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median estimate of 26 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires was a 1.6% decrease in June sales to a 900,000 annual rate.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year-to-year, new-home sales were 22% lower than the level in June 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moribund housing sector has pulled down U.S. economic growth for six straight quarters, and analysts expect more of the same going forward. They think a large inventory of unsold homes will depress prices, which dilutes incentive to invest in property.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's data showed the ratio of new houses for sale to houses sold climbed during June, rising to 7.8 from 7.4 in May. The median price of a new home fell by 2.2% to $237,900 in June, from $243,200 in June 2006. The average price increased by 3.7% to $316,200 from $305,000 a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for durable goods increased by 1.4% last month to a seasonally adjusted $217.07 billion, the Commerce Department said. Durables, which are goods designed to last at least three years, fell 2.3% in May, revised from a previously estimated 2.4% decrease. Orders rose 1.0% in April, 5.1% in March and 0.5% in February.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street expected a slightly bigger increase in orders. The median estimate of 26 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had durables 1.6% higher in June.   </p>

</p><div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">The State of the Slump --- Tighter Credit Helps Keep Housing Inventories Rising, Though Some Hard-Hit Cities See Signs of a Turnaround</span>
</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty and Ruth Simon </div><div>1812 words</div><div>26 July 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tighter credit is prolonging a deep slump in home sales, but a quarterly Wall Street Journal survey of 28 major metro areas shows that the surge in inventories of unsold homes is slowing. In two of those markets -- Boston and Denver -- the number listed for sale has actually declined from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest trends offer some hope for an eventual recovery in a U.S. housing market that generally has been cooling since mid-2005. Even so, many economists and industry executives say that recovery will be very gradual and won't start before 2008 at the earliest. That's partly because more-stringent lending policies are keeping many potential buyers on the sidelines, while others are holding off in hopes of prices heading even lower. Meanwhile, there is still a glut of homes on the market in much of the country, especially in Florida and parts of Arizona, Nevada and California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales and prices generally should bottom out around mid-2008, says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com, a research firm in West Chester, Pa. "The market will not revive quickly, however," he says. "It won't be until the turn of the decade before housing activity returns to more normal conditions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The message for home sellers is that they need to be flexible on price and may have to spruce up their house to stand out against plenty of competition, including from builders desperate to shed inventory. In Atlanta's southwestern suburbs, builder Winstar Neighborhoods is offering free Chevrolet Aveo subcompacts to buyers of certain new homes. Given the glut, buyers in most markets can take their time and bargain hard on price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday, the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of previously occupied homes in June were down 3.8% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.75 million. The number of homes listed for sale nationwide was 4.2 million, up 12% from a year earlier but down 4.2% from May, the Realtors said. The median home price was $230,100, up 0.3% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median prices can be skewed by shifts in the market, however. Lenders are turning down more and more people with weak credit records or high debt in relation to income, and that is hurting sales of lower-end homes. Jeffrey Mezger, chief executive of KB Home, one of the nation's largest mass-market builders, says its average home price has fallen about 12% from a year ago. In some markets, such as Southern California, he says, "there are two markets emerging." While the high-end housing market has remained strong, prices are down in the entry-level and first-time move-up market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As measured by the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller national index, house prices in this year's fourth quarter are likely to be down about 7% from a year earlier, says Thomas Lawler, a housing economist in Vienna, Va. He expects a further fall of about 3.5% in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the picture varies greatly by region and even by neighborhood. The well-heeled can still get loans on attractive terms, and demand has held up far better for homes in desirable neighborhoods near city centers than for homes in more distant and humdrum suburbs. In the San Francisco Bay area, prices have continued to rise briskly in Marin County, a posh area with fairly short commutes to the city, and Santa Clara County, buoyed by hiring at Silicon Valley firms, says Scott Kucirek, general manager of Prudential California Realty. But prices generally have fallen in Solano County, which is a longer commute and has more new construction and entry-level homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But tight credit is squeezing lots of people still trying to buy a first home. William and Kimberly Glass were preapproved for a mortgage in May and found a $540,000, four-bedroom, three-bathroom home in Santa Clarita, Calif., near Los Angeles. But by the time they made the offer, lending standards had tightened to the point where they could no longer buy the home with no money down. "It's a little frustrating that a month and a half ago we were in a better position than we are now," says Mr. Glass, an actor. Putting "3% to 5% down would have basically drained our savings and put us in a precarious position with the renovations [the house] needed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders, under pressure from regulators and investors, are continuing to tighten the screws. Countrywide Financial Corp., J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co., National City Corp. and others are making it tougher for borrowers to finance 100% or even 95% of their home's value by combining a home-equity loan or line of credit with a mortgage. Lenders had earlier cut back on such loans to borrowers with weak credit records and are now tightening standards for borrowers with better credit profiles, particularly those who aren't documenting their income and assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National City has been tightening standards for home-equity loans every month or so in an effort to stay one step ahead of its competitors, says E. Kennedy Carter Jr., an executive vice president there. "We don't want to be the last girl at the dance when it comes to credit quality." With home prices falling, he says, lenders are moving closer to standards set earlier in the decade, when most required at least a 10% down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, Countrywide blamed its 33% drop in second-quarter earnings largely on sharply higher defaults on home-equity loans, particularly those made to borrowers who had little money for a down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders are adopting federal guidelines for nontraditional mortgages, making it harder for borrowers to qualify for mortgages that allow them to pay interest but no principal in the loan's early years, or make a minimum payment that may not even cover the total interest owed. Lehman Brothers Inc.'s Aurora Loan Services unit put the guidelines into effect over a six-month period beginning in December, and Wells Fargo &amp;Co. said it will do so in August. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which purchase loans from lenders and package them into securities, will apply the guidelines to loan applications beginning in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The noose is definitely tightening" around interest-only loans and option adjustable-rate mortgages, two products that were often used by cash-strapped borrowers to make their loan payments more affordable, says Brian Chappelle, a mortgage banking consultant in Washington. About one-third of borrowers who have used these loans in recent years wouldn't qualify under the tighter standards, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices are likely to remain weak in many areas until inventories of unsold homes fall. That process has begun in a few places, including the Boston metro area, where the number of homes listed for sale at the end of June was down 16% from a year earlier. Boston's market cooled in early 2005, before most other areas, and so has had more time to adjust. Some frustrated sellers who don't need to move have taken their homes off the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fall in inventories is a "hopeful sign," says Timothy Warren Jr., chief executive of Warren Group, a financial publisher in Boston, but he thinks sales won't begin rising again before next year. Sales of single-family homes in Massachusetts as a whole in the first half of this year were down 4.3% from a year earlier, and the median price declined 3.6%, to $318,000, according to Warren.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Denver area, the number of homes listed for sale is down 5% from a year ago. Contrary to the national trend, Denver's housing market began cooling in 2001 amid losses of jobs in technology and telecommunications. Job growth in the Denver metro area lagged the national average from mid-2001 through late 2004, but has since been above average. "The market is recovering," says Jeff Bernard, a Denver real-estate broker and developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But inventories have continued to bloat in Florida, where a speculative binge has led to an enormous glut of condos. Miami-Dade County has enough condos on the market to last 31 months at the current sales rate, says Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell Inc., a big real-estate brokerage firm there. Still, the rate of increase in unsold homes in the Miami area has slowed recently, says Ronald Shuffield, president of the firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta's inventory of unsold homes is up 43% from a year ago, according to Smart Numbers, a local research firm. It says there are enough homes on the market to last more than 10 months at the current sales rate, up from six months a year earlier. "We haven't hit the bottom yet in Atlanta," says Steve Palm, the firm's chief executive. Job growth in Atlanta remains strong, but many of the jobs aren't very high-paying, Mr. Palm says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lewis Glenn, president of Harry Norman Realtors in Atlanta, says he believes lots of potential buyers are waiting to see whether prices will come down. Some of them are marooned because they can't sell their current homes for what they consider a fair price -- or enough to pay off their mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Seattle metro area, the number of listings is up 55% from a year ago. But inventories were unusually lean there last year, and the market is now regaining balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the New Jersey suburbs near New York, listings surged in 2005 and 2006. At the end of June, though, listings in 12 northern New Jersey counties were up just 3% from a year ago, according to Otteau Valuation Group, an East Brunswick, N.J., appraisal firm. In Manhattan, inventories are down 17%, according to Corcoran Group, a real-estate brokerage. A torrent of Wall Street bonuses and foreign buyers lured by the weaker dollar have helped keep the market firm there, says Jonathan Miller, chief executive of Miller Samuel Inc., an appraisal firm in New York. The median sale price for co-ops and condos in Manhattan was $895,000 in the second quarter, up 1.7% from a year earlier, according to Miller Samuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey G. Otteau, president of Otteau Valuation Group, says the parts of New Jersey popular with commuters into New York are doing best. In those areas, he says, sales are no longer slumping and the number of homes on the market has leveled off. "Proximity to Manhattan is once again becoming the primary force in the market," he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Problem:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Prices</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Are Falling</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many prime mortgages that have gone bad never should have been made at all. Some of the prime loans that are starting to go bad should have been made only if the lenders could guarantee that housing prices would keep going up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They didn't, and that contributed to Countrywide Financial's 33% drop in quarterly earnings and 10% stock drop on Tuesday. The culprit, the company said, was a surprising jump in delinquencies by prime borrowers who had taken out home-equity loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When prices were rising, homeowners were able to wiggle out of mortgages by refinancing or selling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, amid tighter lending standards, air is seeping out of the bubble, and the escape hatch for troubled borrowers has slammed shut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The challenge now is going to be for people who would like to refinance, but the value of the property is materially lower than their existing loan," said housing economist Thomas Lawler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means more prime-loan defaults are likely on tap. Today's report on June new-home sales could show how aggressively home builders have been cutting prices. Sales of newly built homes in April surged 12%, in part due to an 11% drop in the median sale price. Prices fell just 1% in May and sales fell again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another clue could come from D.R. Horton, which reports fiscal third-quarter earnings today. The home builder said earlier this month that net home orders had tumbled 40% from a year ago. The question is will the company slash prices to get sales moving again?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citigroup May Be Hit Hard</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Tightening Debt Market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the wheels coming off the $12 billion auto loan backing the leveraged buyout of Chrysler, J.P. Morgan Chase, the lead arranger of the deal, has a bit of egg on its face. But the bank's archrival, Citigroup, may look just as bad as leveraged-debt investors refuse to part with their money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citigroup was a lead arranger of $24.6 billion of U.S. loans and bonds yanked from the market, according to Reuters Loan Pricing. Besides Chrysler, it was one of three leads on Allison Transmission, a $3.1 billion loan deal pulled earlier this week. That total doesn't include deals like Dollar General, where underwriters including Citigroup and Goldman Sachs Group sacrificed fees to get them sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citigroup's shares have fallen about 10% since the beginning of last month, while J.P. Morgan's are down 13%. Falling prices for loans in the secondary market could hurt banks' results if they're forced to sell them at a discount. The company is comfortable with the credit it has extended, Gary Crittenden, Citigroup's finance chief, said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a lot of uncertainty," says Jeffrey Harte, analyst at Sandler O'Neill &amp;Partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citigroup has a role in the largest deals in the pipeline, too: TXU, First Data., Alltel and Clear Channel Communications. Recently, Charles Prince, Citigroup's chief executive, said the company was still willing to finance buyouts. "As long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance," he said. Were he asked now, would he still be dancing?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bucking a Trend, Sales of Rental Units Climb</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Philadelphia region, which doesn't typically outperform many other U.S. commercial real-estate markets, has seen rising demand for its apartment-rental complexes even as sales have slumped nationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total value of rental units sold in the Delaware Valley based on deals valued at $1 million or more rose about 19% to about $1.1 billion in 2006 from 2005, according to Hessam Nadji, managing director of research services for Marcus &amp;Millichap Real Estate Investment Services. The region is on track this year to exceed last year's volume based on the first-quarter deals valued at $426.5 million, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in Philadelphia-area apartment sales bucks the nationwide trend, which saw volume fall about 23% in the first quarter from the year earlier to $22.4 billion after standing roughly flat in 2006 from 2005, according to Encino, Calif.-based Marcus &amp;Millichap. In Philadelphia the number of transactions rose 21% in 2006 from a year earlier, while transaction levels fell in such metropolitan areas as San Jose, Calif. and Orlando, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like much of the area's real estate, Philadelphia-area apartment complexes appeal to Northeastern bargain hunters. Median prices for rental-apartment units based on deals valued at more than $5 million in the first quarter were $109,269 in Philadelphia compared with $381,254 in Manhattan and $316,251 in Washington, D.C., according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a New York-based real-estate research firm. That helps to offset the prospect for rising but unexceptional apartment rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many buyers are also betting that Philadelphia rentals are better positioned going forward than in some other markets that have drawn investors buying condominiums they don't plan on living in. As such, Philadelphia's apartment market is steadier than markets where some fear unsold condominiums will be repositioned as rentals, analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there are signs that the condominium market is softening. This year through June, sales of condominiums for the greater Philadelphia region composed of 13 primary counties fell 4.7% to 4,159 though the median sales price rose to $205,000, according to the TREND multiple listing service in King of Prussia, Pa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-quarter Philadelphia-area apartment, office, retail and warehouse rents were below national levels, largely due to the region's below-average job and population growth, according to Property &amp;Portfolio Research Inc., a Boston-based real-estate research firm. However, despite the construction of many new condos in recent years and the development of the Comcast Center office tower, the amount of planned construction is low, which is expected to keep apartment and office vacancies stable, PPR says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The region boasts a growing education and health-services sector, but its shrinking manufacturing base has helped keep job growth at 0.6% in June from last year, well below the 1.4% rate nationally, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile, the area's population rose just 0.1% in 2006 to 3.9 million, below the national rate of 1%, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. The city of Philadelphia is also struggling to combat crime as the total number of murders has risen in recent years to 406 in 2006 from 288 in 2002, according to Captain Benjamin Naish of the Philadelphia Police Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Philadelphia has seen its overall population decline, its downtown Center City area has attracted more restaurants and residents, in part by offering tax abatements. The state has also made a bid to bring in more revenue with the approval of licenses for two separate casinos to operate along the waterfront.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve warned that recent improvements in underlying inflation may prove temporary, though he repeated the Fed's longstanding view that those inflationary pressures should moderate in coming months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In prepared testimony before Congress, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said U.S. economic growth should pick up despite the continued housing drag, and against that backdrop inflation has remained the "predominant" policy risk. He suggested that the likeliest scenario remains a lengthy continuation of the Fed's year-long pause in altering interest rates.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Overall, the U.S. economy appears likely to expand at a moderate pace over the second half of 2007, with growth then strengthening a bit in 2008 to a rate close to the economy's underlying trend," Mr. Bernanke told the House Financial Services Committee, where he delivered his semiannual monetary policy report to Congress.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke used almost half of his prepared remarks to defend the Fed's regulatory record in the subprime mortgage sector. He said the Fed is taking a "top-to-bottom review" of ways to prevent future subprime problems by improving disclosures and using its authority to address unfair practices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed has come under criticism from Congress over its consumer-protection oversight in areas such as credit cards and subprime mortgages, which lawmakers deemed as too lax.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke said yesterday that the central bank would likely propose banning certain mortgage practices across the lending industry to bolster its consumer protection efforts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Based on the information we are gathering, I expect that the [Fed] will propose additional rules under" the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act later this year, Mr. Bernanke said. He suggested some activities that could be prohibited are certain types of mortgage-prepayment penalties.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In part to assuage critics, the central bank and other regulators on Tuesday unveiled a pilot program to more closely monitor certain subprime-mortgage lenders.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics say such companies have slipped through the cracks of state and federal oversight, and helped fuel the rapid expansion of the subprime mortgage market during the recent housing boom.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subprime mortgages are home loans typically made to borrowers with troubled credit histories. As many of these adjustable-rate mortgages reset into higher rates, a record number of homeowners entered the foreclosure process, sparking a political backlash.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monitoring project is slated to begin in the fourth quarter and will focus on the mortgage practices of roughly a dozen "nondepository subsidiaries of bank and thrift holding companies, as well as mortgage brokers doing business with, or working for, these entities," the regulators said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke struck a somewhat cautious tone in his testimony before Congress. The Fed, which has repeatedly warned that inflation remains the predominant risk, has held the federal funds rate unchanged at 5.25% for more than a year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whereas past Fed warnings about inflation and the suggestion that rates would stay on hold for the foreseeable future were once at odds with Wall Street hopes for a near-term easing of policy, Mr. Bernanke and the markets seem increasingly in synch. Financial markets now see the Fed staying on hold into 2008, though its next move is still expected to be a rate cut.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After nearly grinding to a halt in the first quarter, economic growth appeared to pick up rapidly in the second quarter, and economists generally see the economy expanding between 2.5% and 3% in the second half of the year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Bernanke warned that possible declines in the economy's underlying rate of productivity may keep a lid on growth. Indeed, the Fed lowered its 2008 central tendency growth domestic product growth forecast to between 2.5% and 2.75% from its February forecast of between 2.75% and 3%. It also lowered its 2007 GDP forecast because of the weak housing sector.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke called the Fed's expectation for 2008 GDP growth "close to the economy's underlying trend," suggesting that the economy isn't as able to grow rapidly without inflation as it was in the past. The economy's noninflationary potential was once thought to be above 3%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In separate reports, U.S. consumer prices grew moderately last month as energy costs retreated, while underlying inflation advanced within market expectations. And home construction unexpectedly rose in June, after two straight months of declines, but a plunge in building permits indicated the upturn might be short-lived.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consumer price index rose 0.2% in June, the Labor Department said, down from May's 0.7% rise. The core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, advanced 0.2%, up from the previous month's 0.1% increase.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the core inflation number was at the upper end of the central bank's implied comfort zone, the data were broadly in line with Wall Street forecasts. The median forecast of 24 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires was for a 0.1% CPI gain and 0.2% core rise.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said housing starts in June increased 2.3% to a seasonally adjusted 1.467 million annual rate, after falling 3.4% in May to 1.434 million. Originally, Commerce reported May starts were down 2.1% at 1.474 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past six quarters, the housing industry has been a drag on U.S. economic growth. Many economists have suggested that the downturn is close to bottoming out as a downward correction in home prices, coupled with strong U.S. employment growth, helps demand recover.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, U.S. home builders aren't confident the market is set to recover. The National Association of Home Builders index of sentiment for Julyfell to its lowest level since January 1991 amid worries over higher interest rates and problems in the subprime mortgage market.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By Serena Ng and Ruth Simon   </div><div>1297 words</div><div>12 July 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Asia</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2007 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors adjusted to the idea that the downturn in the U.S. housing market is worsening and that a rebound might be months away, at best.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The widening meltdown in the subprime-mortgage market caught up with the U.S.'s two big debt-rating companies Tuesday, with Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's announcing plans to downgrade hundreds of bonds backed by the risky home loans. Stock prices tumbled but recovered a bit yesterday morning.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an acknowledgment that it severely misjudged the risk of bonds tied to subprime mortgages, Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Service said it is looking to slash credit ratings on as many as 612 such bonds, with a value of $12 billion, because of mounting delinquencies on the underlying mortgages. Subprime mortgages are made to borrowers with shaky credit profiles.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hours after S&amp;P's move, Moody's Investors Service said it was downgrading 399 mortgage-backed securities issued in 2006 and reviewing an additional 32 for downgrade, affecting $5.2 billion of bonds. It also downgraded 52 bonds issued in 2005.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ratings actions come after months of intensifying turmoil in the market. They drew howls from some investors who have complained that S&amp;P and Moody's put excessively high ratings on many classes of bonds backed by subprime mortgages during the housing boom and then were too slow to lower those ratings when the housing market started sinking.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Why now?" said Steve Eisman, managing director at hedge fund Frontpoint Partners, in the S&amp;P conference call.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Delinquencies have been a disaster for many months. It couldn't be that you just woke up to it. The rest of the world was yelling and screaming about your ratings for months," added Mr. Eisman, whose fund has been bearish on the subprime market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We did it as fast as we could given the information we had," Tom Warrack, an S&amp;P managing director, said in response.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of S&amp;P's parent, McGraw-Hill Cos., were down 3% to $62.36 late morning yesterday after tumbling 4.4% on Tuesday. Shares of Moody's parent Moody's Corp. were up 13 cents to $60.52 yesterday morning after falling $1.11, or 1.8%, on Tuesday. Both stocks trade on the New York Stock Exchange.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subprime loans have played an increasingly important role in the mortgage market, accounting for 20% of all mortgages originated in 2006, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. In all, $2.3 trillion of subprime loans were taken out by borrowers between 2002 and 2006, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. Key to their growth was the ability of lenders to spread the risks by packaging the loans into securities and selling them to a large number of investors from pension funds to hedge funds, who used the S&amp;P and Moody's ratings to help gauge their quality.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ratings on such bonds are critical because many investors depend on them to decide whether a bond is safe enough to own. Lower ratings could force some investors to dump bonds they had in their portfolios or mark down their value.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One kind of investment that could be especially vulnerable are collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, which are bundles of bonds that often contain many subprime-mortgage-backed securities. CDOs have been sold by investment banks to many pensions, insurance companies and hedge funds. S&amp;P said it is assessing whether these investments might also require ratings downgrades.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, mortgage defaults were relatively low by historical standards, thanks to low interest rates and rising home prices, which made it easy for borrowers who ran into trouble to refinance or sell their homes. Lenders also relaxed their standards for approving loans, making them easier for borrowers to get.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as credit becomes harder to get and house prices soften in many parts of the country, more borrowers are falling behind, with subprime borrowers among the hardest hit. The delinquency rate for subprime loans rose to 13.77% in the first quarter from 11.5% a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far the U.S. economy has managed to withstand the trauma in the subprime-mortgage market and the broader housing slowdown. Many economists believe the economy has already started to improve after a slowdown that set in last year, a view that has helped to keep the stock market on a rising trend.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Tuesday's downgrades could alter that view, in part because they were coupled with earnings warnings from Home Depot Inc., the home-improvement retailer, and home builder D.R. Horton Inc. The news rippled through markets, unleashing a bout of risk aversion that hurt the values of junk bonds, bank loans and credit derivatives. The ABX index, which tracks subprime bonds, hit a record low.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A flight to the relative safety of U.S Treasury bonds sent the price of the 10-year Treasury note up 29/32, or $9.06 for each $1,000 invested, pushing the yield down to 5.040%. The 10-year was little changed yesterday morning, with the yield at 5.036%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tension has been building in credit markets for weeks. One trigger was the near collapse of two hedge funds run by Bear Stearns Cos. The funds made bad bets on the mortgage-bond market and in June had to turn to Bear Stearns for a secured loan of as much as $3.2 billion as other lenders to the struggling hedge funds demanded their money back.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has since hit the corporate-lending market hard. In the past two weeks, investors have balked at five separate offerings of junk bonds used to finance leveraged buyouts. Much bigger financings from the likes of DaimlerChrysler AG's soon-to-be-sold Chrysler Group and First Data Corp. are coming to the market in the weeks ahead, which will test the market's risk appetite.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P said it is likely to lower its ratings very soon on most of the 612 bonds under review. Many of them already had low ratings. But some bore investment-grade ratings. In all, they represented 2.13% of the $565 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities that S&amp;P rated between October 2005 and the end of 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P also said it is revising its methodology and assumptions for rating new subprime bonds and will require more collateral to provide bigger cushions against losses.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moody's latest downgrades affected around 1.2% of the dollar value of 2006 subprime bonds it rated, most of them investment grade. Some of the downgrades hit bonds backed by loans originated by Fremont Investment &amp; Loan and New Century Mortgage Corp., lenders whose problems have been well-known for months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New data from credit bureau Equifax Inc. and Moody's Economy.com show delinquency rates continued to climb across the broader economy in the second quarter, reaching 3.15% of all mortgages, compared with 2.87% in the first quarter. In some bonds targeted for downgrade by S&amp;P and Moody's, delinquencies were around 20%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, the bonds are diced and sliced so that some investors bear more risk than others. Some bonds get single-A, double-A or even triple-A ratings because holders of these bonds are the last to suffer when defaults on underlying mortgages start rising. The fact that they are now being scrutinized for downgrades is a sign of the potential depth of the fallout.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downgrades have wide ranging implications for investors, because credit ratings play an important role in the value attached to bond investments.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>447 words</div><div>5 July 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes on the market in 18 major metropolitan areas continues to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total listings of homes in these metro areas at the end of June was up 2.5% from May, according to figures compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a national real-estate brokerage firm based in Emeryville, Calif. The data cover all listings of single-family homes, condominiums and town houses on local multiple-listing services in those areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another sign of weakness for the housing market, the National Association of Realtors reported this week that its index of pending home sales in May declined 3.5% from a month earlier to stand at 97.7. The index, which is down 13% from a year earlier, equates the 2001 level of activity to 100. The group considers a sale pending when a contract has been signed but the transaction hasn't been completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in the number of homes listed in June was broadly in line with historical trends. In recent years, inventories on a national basis have tended to rise in June. On average over the past two decades, though, they have fallen slightly during that month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The continued growth in supply suggests further downward pressure on house and condo prices in parts of the country. After soaring in the first half of this decade, prices in many markets have been flat to lower over the past two years amid a supply glut and more-cautious mortgage lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Lawler, a housing economist based in Vienna, Va., predicted that the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price index, a national measure, will decline about 7% this year. He said that the housing market is unlikely to start recovering before mid-2008 at the earliest and that the recovery probably will be gradual. Among the wild cards is whether builders will slash production, which would reduce the glut of homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest increases in inventory last month were in metro areas where prices generally have continued to rise. Inventory was up 9.2% in the Seattle area and 6.5% in the San Francisco Bay area. Inventories have been lean in those areas in recent years, pushing up prices, but supply now is catching up with demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories are up sharply from a year earlier. For the 15 cities for which year-earlier comparisons were available, inventory was up 23%. But inventory in the Boston area was down 3.9% from a year earlier, while San Diego was up just 0.3%. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Kelly Evans </div><div>398 words</div><div>30 June 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the second consecutive month, Americans saw their income decline after adjusting for inflation as rising food and energy costs offset gains in wages and salaries. Spending, meanwhile, was weaker than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said that personal income rose 0.4% in May, led by gains in rental and dividend income. However, when adjusting for inflation, personal disposable income was down 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal consumption expenditures, meanwhile, rose 0.5% last month, or 0.1% after adjusting for inflation. Although spending continued to rise and Americans spent more than they earned last month, many economists had expected spending to come in stronger and were disappointed at Friday's report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Higher food and energy prices clearly ate into consumers' discretionary spending power," said Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at MFR Securities Inc. "If the consumer continues to disappoint, then [economic] growth will be a lot weaker than most people are expecting for the second half." Many economists expect the economy, as measured by growth in inflation-adjusted gross domestic product, to advance between 2.5% and 3% in the second half of 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising energy prices are a major reason the closely watched price index of personal consumption expenditures (PCE) -- a measure of inflation -- rose an uncomfortable 0.5% in May. Gasoline prices alone were up 9.9%. But the core price index, which strips out the cost of food and gasoline, rose just 0.1% in May. The core PCE, which is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, is up 1.9% from a year ago, falling below 2% for the first time in three years and supporting the Fed's decision Thursday to leave interest rates steady at 5.25%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the University of Michigan's survey of consumer sentiment in June indicated that the rising gasoline and food costs are continuing to weigh on confidence. The index rose to 85.3 from 83.7, but the level still fell below May's 88.3 tally and was the lowest reading since August 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Commerce Department said construction spending rose 0.9% in May. Spending on new residential homebuilding dropped only 0.8% from April, while private nonresidential spending rose 2.7% and public construction spending rose 2.2%. </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">KB Home</span> reported a fiscal second-quarter loss, reflecting how builders are attempting to slog through a U.S. housing market stuck with an oversupply of homes for sale and slackening demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing affordability challenges and tighter credit conditions in the subprime and near-prime mortgage market have...exacerbated current market dynamics, keeping prospective buyers out of the market, slowing the absorption of excess supply and further delaying a housing market recovery," Chief Executive Jeffrey Mezger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Los Angeles company took a pretax charge of $308.2 million in the quarter ended May 31, covering inventory and joint-venture impairments as well as abandonment of land options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said unit deliveries in the second quarter decreased 36% from the previous year to 4,776 homes. The average selling price dropped 8% to $271,600. Net orders dropped 3% to 7,265.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Against this backdrop, <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> said it was using more price concessions and sales incentives "to meet competition."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We interpret management's tone as more cautious likely due to worsening trends toward the end of the quarter," Banc of America Securities analyst Daniel Oppenheim wrote to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"However, we also think the company was aggressive in working to generate orders and likely found that, with the buyer fear at this point, lower prices do not always lead to increased traffic or sales," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With builders slashing prices on existing inventory and abandoning land options, skyrocketing foreclosures and tighter lending requirements have further stressed an industry not likely to improve until next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday, rival <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp.</span> posted a deep second-quarter loss and warned that crumbling conditions in the housing market could worsen through the rest of the year. Those results came on the heels of a National Association of Realtors report showing that existing-home sales in May fell to their lowest in nearly four years, and data stating that May housing starts fell 2.1% amid production cuts as home builders struggled to pare bloated inventories. Analysts said further price cuts are inevitable as inventories of unsold homes keep growing, amid rising foreclosures.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kelly Evans and Michael Corkery </div><div>860 words</div><div>27 June 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. new-home sales fell in May, and this month's reading on consumer confidence dropped more than expected, weighed down by a stubbornly heavy supply of unsold homes, steep gasoline prices and a softening job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported that the nation's sales of newly constructed homes fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 915,000 units, a 1.6% drop from April's downwardly revised 930,000 homes. The report also showed that the supply of new homes on the market would take about 7.1 months to sell at last month's sales pace, a slight increase from seven months in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As if home builders didn't have enough to fret about, the National Association of Realtors said slowing growth in the number of American households could put additional pressure on the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Household formation, or the increase in housing units occupied by owners or renters, had been running at a pace of more than one million a year. That pace slowed by more than half in the first quarter -- to an increase of 415,000 households from the same period in 2006, according to the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For household formation to weaken so much in a growing economy implies "that people have the financial capacity but they don't have the confidence to move on their own," said Lawrence Yun, senior economist at the Realtors group. Instead, some people may be finding roommates or moving in with their parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said household formation is "the key underlying demand factor" for the housing market over the long term. Though it is "a factor worth watching," he said the quarterly reading is highly volatile and could swing back around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another signal of the weak housing market came from Lennar Corp., one of the nation's largest home builders, which swung to a much larger-than-expected loss for its fiscal second quarter, ended May 31. The Miami company reported a loss of $244.2 million, or $1.55 a share, compared with net income of $324.7 million, or $2 share, a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Since our first-quarter call in March, the market, in fact, has continued to deteriorate" Lennar Chief Executive Stuart Miller told analysts during a conference call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fueling Lennar's loss was a charge of about $329 million, as the company wrote down the value of its developments and land to reflect the weaker market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have been discounting unsold homes to reduce supply, but they face increased competition from sellers in the existing-home market and from foreclosed homes listed for sale. The National Association of Realtors said Monday that the inventory of existing homes increased to a 8.9 months' supply in May, the largest buildup since the previous housing slump in 1992.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said the median sales price of new homes fell 0.9% to $236,100 last month, after tumbling 10.9% in April. But analysts say the median price may not reflect the lavish incentives that builders are using to entice buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar's Mr. Miller told analysts that three things need to occur for the housing market to recover: supplies of unsold homes need to decline, home-buyer confidence needs to be restored and the subprime-mortgage business needs to be replaced by other sources of lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the mortgage market remains in flux. A report from rating company Standard &amp;Poor's pointed to a sharp rise in late payments and defaults on Alt-A home-mortgage loans, a category between prime and subprime. Alt-A loans often go to investors or borrowers who are unable or unwilling to fully document their income or assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P found that 4.21% of Alt-A loans bundled into mortgage-backed securities last year were 90 or more days overdue after 14 months. That was up sharply from 1.59% for loans from 2005 and 0.91% for loans from 2004. The data exclude pay-option loans, which provide borrowers several choices for how much they pay each month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures are the latest indication that the surge in defaults has spread beyond subprime mortgages, or home loans made to consumers with troubled credit histories. The surge in defaults has prompted lenders to tighten up on their credit standards in recent months, forcing some people who want to buy or refinance homes to put off those plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, a key indicator of consumer confidence dropped to a 10-month low this month. The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence fell to 103.9 from 108.5 in May, led by a downbeat assessment of the job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The present-situation component of the index tumbled to 127.9 from May's reading of 136.1 as more respondents said present conditions are "bad" and fewer said present conditions are "good." The expectations index also dropped, to 87.9 from 90.1.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes on the market increased 5% in May, adding to a glut in many parts of the country and threatening to push prices lower as the housing market keeps tumbling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors reported that the number of previously occupied houses and condominiums listed for sale rose to a total of 4.43 million last month from 4.22 million in April. The May total was enough to last 8.9 months at the current sales rate, the trade group said. That is the largest inventory buildup since 1992, during a previous housing slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales fell 0.3% in May from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.99 million, the lowest in four years and a 10.3% decline from a year earlier. The median home price in May fell to $223,700, down 2.1% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Though sales of existing homes fell only slightly in May, falling prices and record high inventories leave little doubt that the 'correction' in the housing market is nowhere near ending," David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities, wrote to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 5% increase in homes on the market was notable because inventories typically have been little changed in May during the past two decades, according to <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group.</span> May is one of the busiest months for home sales because families with children usually want to move during the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People trying to sell their homes face increasingly tough competition from homebuilders, which built aggressively over the past few years and are now slashing prices to entice buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If builders can be disciplined and cut back on production, then overall inventory would begin to diminish," said Lawrence Yun, a senior economist for the Realtors association. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Existing-home sales in the U.S. fell in May to their lowest level in nearly four years, while inventories climbed and prices fell a 10th straight time.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales fell to a 5.99 million annual rate, a 0.3% decrease from April's revised 6.01 million annual pace, the National Association of Realtors said. That was in line with Wall Street expectations and was the lowest pace of demand since 5.94 million in June 2003.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price in the U.S. was $223,700 in May, down 2.1% from $228,500 in May 2006.   </p>

"The market is underperforming when you consider positive fundamentals such as the strength of job creation, economic growth, favorable mortgage interest rates and flat home prices," Mr. Yun said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some private analysts said the U.S. housing slump will keep restraining the economy. Builders broke ground in May at a lower rate than the month before, confirming their loss of confidence in a market bloated with inventory. The U.S. government reported last week that May housing starts fell 2.1%, marking the first drop in four months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lifeless housing market has reduced economic growth for six consecutive quarters, and a bulging supply of unsold homes suggests further drag.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By Kelly Evans </div><div>544 words</div><div>20 June 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's home builders continued to cut production last month as they struggled to pare bloated inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 2.1% in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.474 million from 1.506 million in April, the Commerce Department said. Starts were down 24.2% from a year earlier and 35.7% from their peak rate in January 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, which are required in most localities before construction can begin, rose last month. But much of the gain was a result of permits for apartment buildings. Demand for apartments has been growing as rising interest rates and tighter lending standards have encouraged more families to rent a home instead of purchase one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits overall increased 3% in May, but single-family home permits fell 1.8%, while permits for apartments gained 17%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown in building activity, coupled with reports of rising foreclosures and declining confidence among builders, could mean the tumbling housing market has yet to hit a trough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Things aren't going to get better anytime soon," said Drew Matus, senior U.S. economist at <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers.</span> Mr. Matus said that yesterday's report suggests that builders are trying to rebalance the market by cutting supply instead of prices -- a decision, he said, that is better for builders and for the economy as a whole. "We economists prefer to see a volume adjustment rather than a price adjustment," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling home prices can make homeowners feel less wealthy, prompting them to reduce spending. That, in turn, can slow economic growth. "What you really want to see happen is a balance between supply and demand in the market," Mr. Matus said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other analysts, however, said further price cuts are inevitable as inventories of unsold homes keep growing, partly because of rising foreclosures. The inventory of existing homes for sale has risen nearly 25% since last year, according to the National Association of Realtors. At the current rate of sales, it would take 8.4 months to sell all the previously owned homes now on the market. That was twice as long as the average in 2004 and 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're going to have to see far more significant price declines to start moving this inventory," said Richard Moody, chief economist at Mission Residential, an Austin, Texas, apartment-building owner, referring to the single-family home market. "It's taking really significant price cuts and incentives to move these units."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't call it a recession -- because there's no official definition of a housing recession -- but we are in that league in terms of a setback," said David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that much of the recent weakness reflects tighter lending standards, as well as the meltdown in the market for subprime mortgages -- home loans made to consumers with shaky credit. Climbing interest rates in the past month have also nudged up mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Seiders said the housing market is weaker than he initially thought, and he expects housing starts to drop throughout the rest of 2007. "The bottom has not yet been reached," he said. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Treasury prices rose for a third consecutive session, sending yields lower, after government data on housing starts and building permits pointed to continued softness in the U.S. housing market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midafternoon yesterday, the 10-year note was up 13/32 point at 95 16/32, yielding 5.086%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond prices recovered from early slight losses after the Commerce Department said starts of new homes fell in May, while April's data were revised lower. But building permits rose.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report came a day after the National Association of Home Builders said its housing-market index fell to its lowest level in 16 years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Overall, a continued story of a soft-housing arena," said David Ader, government-bond strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital. "Market is a bit firmer on this but things are pretty quiet ahead of what appears to be a very busy corporate calendar."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts of new homes in the U.S. fell 2.1% in May to an annual rate of 1.47 million, the Commerce Department said. Building permits for new construction rose 3% to 1.5 million. The figures were slightly stronger than expected by economists in a MarketWatch survey.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">T.J. Marta, a fixed-income strategist at  <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span>, said that while building permits rose more than expected, "housing starts overall disappointed, as the tiny upside surprise for May was offset by a downward revision to April."   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors Give</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing Data</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scant Attention</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector has been like the tree falling alone in the proverbial forest -- if it's making noise, investors aren't hearing it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's Commerce Department report on housing construction will probably show home builders pulled back again last month. Economists estimate builders broke ground on new homes at an annual rate of 1.474 million in May. That's down 3.5% from April's 1.528 million rate and down 36% from the peak in January last year, when builders were starting homes at an annual rate of 2.292 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rebound isn't in sight. The National Association of Home Builders says its gauge of builder sentiment fell in June to its lowest level since 1991.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the Dow Jones Industrial Average is back within chipping range of the highs it hit earlier this month. Small wonder. Even though the housing downturn has been more severe than many forecasters expected, its broader effect on the economy has been muted, in part because consumers keep spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors might even see soft housing reports as "market friendly," because such reports make it harder for the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates. For stock investors right now, low rates are paramount; cheap debt helps keep alive the corporate buyout boom, which is underpinning stock prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, even though the short-term interest rates controlled by the Fed are holding steady, long-term interest rates are rising. That threatens to do even more damage to housing. At some point, that tree in the forest might make some noise that everybody hears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How Television-Price War</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could Trip Up Best Buy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the scrap between retailers Best Buy and Circuit City Stores, Best Buy has been turning the lights out on its electronics rival.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Buy, which reports earnings today, is expected to report net income of 50 cents a share, up 6.4% from a year ago, according to Thomson Financial. Circuit City, which reports tomorrow, is forecast to lose 32 cents, versus a three-cent gain last year. But Best Buy might be vulnerable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both companies have suffered from a plunge in prices and profit margins on flat-screen TVs. Best Buy has adapted more quickly than its rival, but the price war could intensify.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One behind-the-scenes wild card is a California TV maker named Vizio, which sells low-price TVs through discounters like Costco Wholesale and Wal-Mart Stores. A 32-inch flat-panel TV made by Samsung costs $897 at Wal-Mart; a similar Vizio TV runs for $597, according to research outfit Current Analysis. Vizio, which sources out of China, has "structurally changed the market," Bank of America analyst David Strasser wrote in a report yesterday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analyst noted Vizio has the fourth-largest market share of TVs 30 inches wide or more, and is growing rapidly. Its "shelf share" of liquid-crystal display TVs jumped to 5.9% in May from 1.8% the previous month, Current Analysis says, due to a deal to sell more TVs at Wal-Mart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Buy, which has focused on higher margin, more expensive TVs, doesn't sell Vizio. Circuit City does. High gasoline prices and the weakening housing market could send more consumers looking for deals on flat-screen TVs in the months ahead. Right now, they won't find them at Best Buy.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jeff Bater </div><div>282 words</div><div>19 June 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The confidence of the nation's home builders sank in June to its lowest level in 16 years, battered by rising mortgage rates and worries about problems in the market for subprime loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Home Builders said its housing-market index for sales of new, single-family homes declined to 28, down from 30 in May and the lowest reading since February 1991.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's clear that the crisis in the subprime sector has prompted tighter lending standards in much of the mortgage market, and interest rates on prime-quality home mortgages have moved up considerably during the past month along with long-term Treasury rates," the trade group's chief economist, David Seiders, said in a prepared statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Seiders predicted home sales will erode in the months ahead and that improvements in housing starts probably won't show up until early next year. "As a result, we expect housing to exert a drag on economic growth during the balance of 2007," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the housing-market index's components, the index for present sales of single-family homes fell to 29 in June from 31 in May. Expectations for sales in the next six months dropped to 39 from 41 in May. The traffic of prospective buyers slipped to 21 from 22.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index was based on a survey of 409 home builders, who answered questions about sales prospects. When the index exceeds 50, it means the number of builders who see "good" sales outnumber the number who see "poor" sales. The index is adjusted for seasonal variations.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Shorter-dated U.S. Treasury prices advanced, after a report showed the view for U.S. home building is the worst in 16 years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midafternoon yesterday, the benchmark 10-year note rose 2/32 point to 94 31/32, yielding 5.153%. The 30-year bond fell 2/32 point to 92 12/32, yielding 5.260%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Home Builders said its builders' housing market index fell two points to 28 in June, the lowest since February 1991. At 28, the index shows that fewer than one-third of builders think the housing market is good or fair. The decline was in line with expectations of economists in a MarketWatch survey.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The release suggested "the softening housing market is expected to weigh on the broader economy for the balance of the year," said Ian Lyngen, bond strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAHB's report comes a day ahead of the government's data on housing starts and building permits for May. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch forecast a 4% drop in starts to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.46 million, down 36% from the peak. Meanwhile, permits are expected to be unchanged at 1.46 million, down 35% from the peak.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing report could show further deterioration in the residential real-estate market. Until recently, there were widespread predictions that a sluggish housing sector would push the Federal Reserve to cut U.S. interest rates this year.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty, Jonathan Karp and Mark Whitehouse </div><div>1695 words</div><div>9 June 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists are giving up on the idea that the U.S. housing slump will be quick and relatively painless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, more are concluding, the downturn that began nearly two years ago will last at least through the end of 2007, remaining a major drag on the U.S. economy. The culprits: a glut of homes for sale and growing caution among lenders who now regret being so free with their mortgages during the boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most forecasters still expect the economy to regain some momentum this year after a slow first quarter. Recent data have shown manufacturing, business investment and trade on track to help offset the negative effects of falling home values on consumer spending. Even so, some economists expect economic growth this year to remain tepid, largely because of the weak housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This worry coincides with a surge of inflation anxiety that has roiled stock and bond markets in recent days. Yields on 10-year Treasury bonds, which influence the cost of various forms of borrowing throughout the economy, have risen above the psychologically important 5% level to the highest point in nearly 11 months. That in turn has led to a big drop in stock prices: Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard &amp;Poor's 500 fell nearly 2% for the week after hitting all-time highs early on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in interest rates is only adding to the gloom. The average rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages stood at about 6.65% Friday, up from 6.35% in early May, according to HSH Associates, a financial-publishing firm in Pompton Plains, N.J. Though that rate remains far below the 8.2% average of the 1990s, the recent jump makes it harder for many Americans to afford new homes. "That's putting more pressure on housing and delays its ultimate recovery," says Andrew Tilton, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke acknowledged in a speech Tuesday that the housing market remains weak, and warned that residential construction "will likely remain subdued for a time, until further progress can be made in working down the backlog of unsold new homes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market started to cool in mid-2005 after a buying frenzy that drove up the average U.S. home price nearly 60% in the first half of the decade and more than doubled prices in many areas near the East and West coasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last year, some economists were saying the market would start bouncing back by the middle of 2007. That hasn't happened, partly because inventories of unsold houses have continued to grow and a surge in mortgage defaults has made lenders much more reluctant to grant credit to people with spotty payment histories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Resler, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Nomura Securities International Inc.</span> in New York, says he is surprised by the degree to which speculation caused builders to overestimate demand, leaving a glut of houses and condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means single-family housing starts, which have declined 33% since early 2006 to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about 1.2 million in April, will remain low, around the current level, through the first quarter of 2008 before starting to recover gradually, Mr. Resler predicts. Goldman's Mr. Tilton thinks single-family starts will drop to an annual rate of one million or so before bottoming out in the second half of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reflecting this worse-than-expected slump, Mr. Resler recently trimmed his forecast for economic growth in the second half of this year to an annual rate of 2.8% from 3%. He sees about a 33% chance that the U.S. economy will slip into a recession in the next year. If it does, he says, the weak housing market would be largely to blame. Among the risks, he says, are that depreciating home values will make consumers more cautious in spending and that many more housing-related jobs will be lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics, a research firm in Valhalla, N.Y. , doesn't expect a recession but says weakness in housing will help keep U.S. economic growth at a sluggish pace averaging less than 2% for the next several quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing accounts for a lot of jobs, not only in construction but in related areas such as mortgage finance and furniture sales. Zoltan Pozsar, senior economist at Moody's Economy.com, estimates that housing-related sectors created nearly 1.3 million jobs between January 2003 and March 2006. Since then, he says, housing jobs have declined by almost 300,000. He sees more losses to come during the summer, which is usually a big building season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home values can also influence consumer spending, as people use cash-out mortgage refinancings and home-equity loans to pull money out of their houses. At the peak of the housing boom in the third quarter of 2005, people were taking cash out of their homes at an annual rate of $709 billion, according to Michael Feroli, an economist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co</span> in New York. As of the first quarter of 2007, that number had fallen to $178 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A prolonged housing slump would be particularly painful for retailers of the kinds of things people often buy when they move, such as building and gardening supplies. According to the Commerce Department, those retailers saw sales drop by 6% in the year ending April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, empty houses are multiplying. A recent <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> report tallies a record 2.2 million vacant single-family homes and condos for sale nationwide, about one million above the norm. Florida's Miami Dade County has a 31-month supply of existing condos on the market. About 20,000 new ones will be completed by the end of 2008, says Jack McCabe, a consultant in Deerfield Beach, Fla. He says about two-thirds of those have been sold, but many buyers are canceling orders rather than taking possession of a depreciating asset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some local markets remain strong. Prices have continued to rise in Manhattan, Seattle, Houston and some other areas. But in much of the country, home prices have been flat to moderately lower over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists at <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> admit it is hard to predict how the slump will play out from here. "We are not sure how deflating a $23 trillion asset class -- the value of real-estate assets on the household balance sheet -- will end, but we doubt that it will end well," Merrill economists wrote in their recent report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outlook is confusing for the average home shopper, too. Bill Shakespeare, a marine-engine salesman who doesn't mind the inevitable jokes about his name, attended an auction of foreclosed homes in San Diego last month, hoping for a steep bargain. Wearing a red baseball cap and windbreaker, the 74-year-old Mr. Shakespeare made an initial offer of $140,000 for a 600-square-foot condominium. Then he gave up when the bidding spiraled to the winning level of $180,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shakespeare, one of more than 1,000 people who turned up at the auction, notes that there are plenty of other condos on the market, some of which have been unoccupied for months. "We're not going to be rushed into anything," he insists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The auction in San Diego was one of three held in Southern California last month by Real Estate Disposition Corp. of Irvine, Calif. The auctions, at which a total of about 280 homes were offered, attracted several thousand people, demonstrating that there are lots of bargain hunters waiting to pounce on the right deal. But the auctions also underlined the trouble some of those opportunists have in obtaining credit. In several-dozen cases at these auctions, homes had to be put back on the block after initial winners failed to qualify for a loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders have eliminated most no-money-down "subprime" loans for people with weak credit records. That means many people who hoped to buy homes this year will have to wait until they can clean up their credit records and save for a down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a conference of mortgage lenders in May, David Lowman, head of the mortgage business at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co.</span>, warned: "The largest part of the problem in the subprime space is ahead of us, not behind us." Many borrowers who got loans the past couple of years are still paying the low initial monthly payments and have yet to face the steeper adjustable rates that kick in after two or three years. Once they do, foreclosures are sure to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Economy.com, a research firm in West Chester, Pa., expects lenders to acquire about 900,000 homes this year and roughly the same number next year through foreclosures, up from an average of about 500,000 a year from 2000 through 2006. That will add to the glut of homes on the market, further depressing prices in some areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the San Diego auction, homes typically sold for around 25% less than their most recent sales prices or appraised values. (The comparison includes a 5% commission paid by winning bidders.) Demand seemed stronger at another recent auction of foreclosed homes in Los Angeles and Orange counties. Many of the houses offered there sold for about 85% to 95% of previous prices or appraisals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Los Angeles auction, Suresh Gupta, a condo developer, made the winning bid of about $1.2 million for a three-bedroom home in Pasadena, where he and his family plan to move. The house had a previous value of $1.5 million. Mr. Gupta thinks the auction price compares favorably with what he could get through a conventional purchase. "There is no justification for the prices many homeowners are asking for," he says. "They are living in a dreamland." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growing inventories of unsold homes continue to weigh on the U.S. housing market, portending more downward pressure on prices, the latest data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes listed for sale in 18 major U.S. metropolitan areas at the end of May was up 5.1% from April, according to figures compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a national real-estate brokerage firm based in Emeryville, Calif. The data cover all listings of single-family homes, condos and town houses on local multiple-listing services in those areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sizable increase is notable because, on a national basis, inventories of listed homes have typically been little changed in May during the past two decades, according to <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group.</span> May is one of the peak home-selling months because families with children often aim to move during the summer vacation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the biggest inventory increases last month came in the metro areas of Seattle, up 12% from April; San Francisco, 11%; Los Angeles, 10%; and Washington, D.C., 9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories also are up sharply from a year earlier. For the 15 cities for which year-earlier comparisons were available, combined inventory was up 29% from May 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been cooling for the past two years after a buying frenzy in the first half of the decade. Prices have flattened or declined moderately in much of the country. A tightening of lending standards has put more downward pressure on the market by making it harder, if not impossible, for some potential buyers to get credit. Meanwhile, rising foreclosures are dumping more homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the National Association of Realtors said its index of pending home sales in April declined 3.2% from March and was down 10% from April 2006. Sales are considered pending when the buyer and seller have agreed on terms but the transaction hasn't been completed. </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. economy barely grew in the first quarter, expanding at its slowest rate in more than four years, but there were signs the slowdown might pave the way for a rebound in the current quarter.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, the U.S. Commerce Department said first-quarter gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 0.6%, well below its previous estimate of 1.3% and the slowest growth rate since 0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2002.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown in the U.S. is likely to concern those global exporters who rely on the world's largest consumer market to buy their products.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, because U.S. businesses drew down their inventories during the quarter, economists expect growth to accelerate in the second quarter as those businesses rev up production.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first quarter, a big increase in imports was one of the biggest drags on the U.S. economy, shaving one percentage point off the growth rate -- almost twice as much as the Commerce Department estimated a month ago. Imports rose 5.7% in the quarter, far more than the previously estimated 2.3%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in business inventories helped to chip another one percentage point off first-quarter growth. Inventories fell at an annual rate of $4.5 billion in the quarter, far from the $14.8 billion increase estimated originally.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. exports slipped 0.6%, less than the previously estimated decline of 1.2%. Those shipments are expected to recover in the current quarter.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The strong global growth backdrop should ensure a solid rebound," said  <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> economist Haseeb Ahmed in a note to clients.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street is predicting second-quarter GDP growth of around 3% as capital investment rebounds and consumer spending remains strong. That spending jumped 4.4% in the first quarter, up from 4.2% in the fourth quarter. Business outlays gained 2.9%, recovering from a fourth-quarter decline of 3.1%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Not only has the pace of final domestic demand accelerated, but we also expect that the drag from inventories will be significantly less going forward," Global Insight chief economist Nariman Behravesh said in a note to clients.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Normally, inventories grow $30 billion to $40 billion," said  <span class="companylink">Putnam Investments</span> economist David Kelly. "As we get back to a normal level of inventories, that will boost GDP."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Companies already seem to be engaged in inventory rebuilding," said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics. "The strength of the world economy argues for better export growth, helped along by a more competitive dollar."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential fixed investment, which includes spending on housing, fell by 15.4% in the first quarter, a smaller decline than the originally estimated 17%. Fourth-quarter spending plunged by 19.8%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate profits got a bit stronger in the first three months of 2007. Profits after taxes grew by 1% to $1.184 trillion, after rising by 0.8% in the fourth quarter.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report Thursday showed the number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits fell last week for the sixth time in seven weeks. Jobless claims retreated by 4,000 to 310,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis in the week ended May 26, the Labor Department said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And U.S. construction spending unexpectedly rose for a third consecutive month during April, even though outlays in the key housing sector lost more ground. The Commerce Department reported total spending increased by 0.1% at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.190 trillion.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes in the U.S. slipped in April to their slowest pace since June 2003, and a rising inventory of unsold properties appeared to set the stage for weaker prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2.6% decline from March, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.99 million homes, followed a revised 7.9% drop in March. April's sales rate was down 10.7% from a year earlier, figures from the National Association of Realtors showed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of existing homes for sale jumped 10.4% at the end of April to 4.2 million, equal to 8.4 months' worth of sales at the current selling rate, up from 7.4 months in March. The unsold properties relative to sales hit a 15-year high.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes slipped in April to their slowest pace since June 2003, and a rising inventory of unsold properties appeared to set the stage for weaker prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2.6% decline from March, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.99 million homes, followed a revised 7.9% drop in March. April's sales rate was down 10.7% from a year earlier, figures from the National Association of Realtors showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of existing homes for sale jumped 10.4% at the end of April to 4.2 million, equal to 8.4 months' worth of sales at the current selling rate, up from 7.4 months in March. The unsold properties relative to sales hit a 15-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price in April of $220,900 was just 0.8% below the year-earlier level. The median price can be misleading because the mix of sales between higher-and lower-priced homes changes. Lately, there may have been fewer sales of cheaper homes because of the huge drop in subprime lending. That would tend to skew the median higher, suggesting home prices may actually be declining more than the reported median suggests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We expect increased pressure on sellers to lower prices due to the sharp buildup in inventory levels and slower pace of sales," Daniel Oppenheim, a housing analyst at Banc of America Securities, said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes dropped most in the Northeast, by 8.8%. They slipped 1.7% in the West, 1.2% in the South and 0.7% in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall sales declines nationwide can be attributed in large part to tighter lending standards and a drop in mortgage offers for people with weaker credit, said Lawrence Yun, a senior economist at the National Association of Realtors. That "short-term disruption" from a meltdown among subprime lenders put April's sales pace about 5% lower than anticipated earlier, said Mr. Yun, who expects "very minimal" price declines and an overall market turnaround in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, he said, the sudden rise in inventories is due in part to existing homeowners seeing an opportunity to trade up -- leading them to list their current homes on the market while they shop. "It could be implying that existing homeowners are feeling a little more confident about reentering the market," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales are recorded at settlement, so April sales could reflect contracts signed months earlier. New-home sales, which are recorded when a contract is signed or deposit made and are thus a more timely indicator of home demand, jumped a surprising 16% in April from March, the largest monthly increase in 14 years, according to a report Thursday by the Commerce Department's Census Bureau. It showed strength especially in the lower-cost South, helping median prices drop 10.9% to $229,100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many analysts are skeptical that new-home sales are as strong as that report suggests, noting the data are not adjusted for cancellations and are based on a small sample. Existing home sales, which include condos, townhouses and co-ops, account for about 85% of total home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The disconnect between the April new-home data and other housing-demand indicators hints that the volatile and often-revised new-home data overstate the improvement," said Richard Berner, chief U.S. economist at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, in a note to clients. "And still-high inventories of unsold homes imply further downside in housing activity."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales retreated in April, dropping to the lowest pace in nearly four years in another negative sign for the slumping housing sector. Home resales fell to a 5.99 million annual rate, a 2.6% decrease from March's revised pace, the National Association of Realtors said Friday. The median price for a home previously owned was $220,900 in April, down 0.8% from $222,600 in April 2006, but up from $217,400 the month before. Read reactions from economists and others to the data, and how they interpret the numbers in the wake of Thursday's more upbeat new-homes data.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales peaked during the summer of 2005 and fell hard between then and September 2006. Between September 2006 and February 2007 it appeared that sales had stabilized but the last two months have seen another sharp decline that is broadly unaffected by weather. This recent weakness may have been aggravated by the turmoil in the subprime market although the evidence is weak. Sluggish sales have kept inventories of unsold homes at very high levels. This, in turn, has pressured prices, which have been falling for the past nine months. The housing correction is definitely not complete . . . .   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Steven Wood, Insight Economics   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We had expected a modest weather-related bounce in existing home sales in April -- since resales are recorded at contract closing, the data tend to lag reality by a month or two -- reflecting better weather in March. However, we are not at all surprised that home sales would be weak in April in particular and most likely all spring, as uncertainty surrounding the subprime mortgage situation definitely appears to be encouraging potential buyers to sit on their hands a while longer to see what the market will look like when the dust clears.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Stephen Stanley, RBS Greenwich Capital   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing data for April have been mixed as housing starts and new home sales were stronger, while existing home sales and building permits were weaker. . . . While the conflicting data for April make it difficult to assess the trend in housing activity, it appears that the adjustment in this sector is still ongoing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Bear Stearns Economics   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing demand appears to have bottomed, but two housing headwinds still loom: The impact of tighter lending standards on demand is only beginning to appear, and there is still a mismatch between housing demand and supply. The upshot: The intensity of the housing recession is fading, but it is far from over.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We just got our second report on the state of the housing market in April -- existing home sales. The big story is the inventory/supply glut. We have set a new high in homes on the market, and that's going to keep the pressure on prices. . . . Until sellers get realistic and start cutting prices aggressively -- like the new-home builders clearly are -- the market will remain oversupplied. That, in turn, will keep the pressure on sellers and give buyers the upper hand.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- New-home sales soared unexpectedly in the U.S. last month, posting their biggest climb in 14 years, while inventories of unsold homes fell, raising hopes of recovery in the housing market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the manufacturing sector, demand for big-ticket goods rose in April, but fell short of Wall Street's expectations. Capital spending by businesses also increased.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. sales of single-family homes increased for the first time in four months, the Commerce Department said Thursday. They rose 16% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 981,000 -- though that was still down 11% from a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average home price in April was $299,100, down from $324,700 in March and $310,300 a year earlier. The median price was $229,100, down from $257,600 in March and $257,000 a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were an estimated 538,000 U.S. homes for sale at the end of April, a 6.5-month supply at the current sales rate. That is down from 546,000 homes, an 8.1-month supply, in March.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for durable goods -- products designed to last three years or more -- rose 0.6% in April to a seasonally adjusted $217.86 billion, the Commerce Department said. The March increase was revised upward, to 5% from 3.7%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An important barometer of business-equipment spending -- orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- climbed by 1.2%, after increasing 4.4% in March. They were down 1.3% from a year earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">April shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased by 0.7%, after rising 1.5% in March; the shipments are used in calculating gross domestic product.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's numbers added to optimism about the manufacturing sector, which recently has been giving off signals of improving health. The monthly Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index rose to 54.7 in April from 50.9 in March. And U.S. industrial production rose by 0.7% last month, more than twice the expected 0.3%.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael Corkery </div><div>548 words</div><div>25 May 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes surged in April as prices plummeted, indicating that builders are making huge concessions to entice buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Census Bureau said sales of newly constructed homes rose 16.2% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 981,000 homes, the largest monthly gain in 14 years and far exceeding economists' expectations. But the report also found that median prices tumbled 10.9% to $229,100 as builders offered deep discounts and other incentives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Aggressive sales techniques being employed by builders are now showing some success," David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is an encouraging sign, say some economists, because it suggests that demand for housing can be revived if prices fall in line with buyers' expectations. Still, economists aren't ready to say the market is on the mend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It could mean that we have hit bottom, but it's too early to make that call," said Patrick Newport, an economist at Global Insight Inc. "We need a couple more good months before we can say that things are turning around."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists and analysts caution that the government's monthly new-home-sales report is highly volatile, uses a small sample size and may overstate conditions in the housing market because it doesn't include cancellations of contracts on new homes. "We think that April was yet another month in which the Census Bureau data clashes with reality," Daniel Oppenheim, a housing analyst at Banc of America Securities, wrote in a report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Toll, chief executive of Toll Brothers Inc., the luxury-home builder based in Horsham, Pa., was also cautious about housing conditions when he talked to analysts yesterday after the company released fiscal second-quarter earnings. "I would say that we have not got the bad times behind us yet," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll said net income declined 79% to $36.7 million, or 22 cents a share, in the quarter ending April 30. On average, analysts polled by Thomson Financial expected earnings of 25 cents a share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Toll noted "glimmers" of strength in markets such as New York City; Austin, Texas; Dallas; and Raleigh, N.C. That was somewhat consistent with the Census Bureau report, which found that sales were strongest in the South, where they were up 27% in April from a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government report found that sales over the same period increased 8.5% in the West and 3.8% in the Northeast. Sales fell 4% in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll said it expects to complete between 6,100 and 6,900 homes in 2007 but declined to give full-year earnings guidance, saying it can't estimate future write-offs, because of the uncertain market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the bright side, Toll said cancellations fell to 19% in the second quarter from 30% in the first quarter and 37% in the fourth quarter of last year. Still, cancellations in the second quarter remain well above the company's historic rate of 7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Toll told analysts he had become a "little more confident" about sales trends in recent weeks. "But I would emphasize the little." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes increased in April, the first gain in four months, rising 16% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 981,000, the Commerce Department said. The median estimate of 25 economists surveyed by was a 0.2% increase. New-home sales were 11% lower than in April 2006. The average price of a home last month was $299,100, down from $324,700 in March and $310,300 in April 2006. The median price dropped to $229,100 from $257,600 in March and $257,000 in April 2006. Economists aim to explain the surprise in the data, and point to index volatility.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have cautioned that double-digit gains of new-home sales are VERY unreliable monthly data points. (It is mostly due to the way the builders self-report their sales to Commerce). . . Whenever new-home sales jump double digits, it usually reflects a mean reversion from the prior (or subsequent) month's reportage. Indeed, over the past 15 years of data, we found that a mean regression followed nearly every double-digit monthly gains. Typically, the subsequent month's data was significantly lowered -- flat to negative in nearly every case.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Ritholtz Research &amp; Analytics   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly all of the strength was in the South, and this depressed prices simply because the South is a lower-priced region. There was a modest decline in the Midwest, and modest strength in the Northeast and West. It remains to be seen if this is a one-month aberration. . . However, it is clear that indications of a mediocre Spring buying season have been put in some doubt with this report.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Joshua Shapiro, MFR, Inc.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only homes priced less than $200,000 had stronger sales in April. The sharp increase in sales will help home builders shed some of the huge inventory of unsold homes and could limit further cuts in new construction. . . Despite the April sales surge, the median number of months that a new completed home has been on the market jumped to six months, the highest since July 1993... Builders will need to maintain aggressive pricing strategies AND lower production levels to shed these inventories. Any recovery in home-building still lies well in the future.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Nomura Economics Research   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was the biggest one-month jump in sales since April '93, but the margin of error in these numbers is massive, plus or minus 13%. One big monthly change, in either direction, does not make a trend. Note too that the sales number is at odds with the NAHB index, which fell at a steady pace in each of the three months to May, reversing all its prior gain.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Ian Shepherdson, High Frequency Economics   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're at a loss to explain this spike in sales in light of the recent renewed gloominess among home builders. . . On the other hand, the Mortgage Bankers Association's survey of mortgage applications has been showing surprising recent strength.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--  <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> Research   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's data do help confirm that the current production/demand imbalance was not as severe as implied by miserable first-quarter sales figures. We greatly doubt that a new buying surge is under way. While the surge in sales reported in April should be discounted, today's data should add to confidence that some mild progress is being made on inventories at close to the current sales pace.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since this is a very volatile and revision-prone series, it is difficult to read too much into any one month's report. It appears that consumers responded to lower-priced homes in April, resulting in a sharp increase in sales and a decline in the supply of homes.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By Sudeep Reddy </div><div>586 words</div><div>17 May 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Permits for new-home construction plunged last month to their lowest point in almost a decade, the latest sign that the struggling U.S. housing market may hold back economic growth for much of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a turnaround in industrial production offered some hope, with strong manufacturing growth driven by the auto sector and computers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home construction picked up in April, the market is expected to face trouble ahead. Permits declined 8.9% from March to an annual rate of 1.43 million, marking the largest percentage drop since a 24% tumble in February 1990. Permits are now down 41% from their 2005 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The big plunge is a little bit shocking," said Global Insight economist Patrick Newport. "It probably means we won't see a turnaround until sometime in 2008."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of new homes unexpectedly jumped 2.5% in April to an annualized 1.53 million, the third straight month-over-month increase, the Commerce Department said. But that's down 16.1% from a year earlier. March figures were revised downward to a pace of 1.49 million from 1.52 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The April uptick in housing starts follows months of bad weather that held back many builders, especially in the Northeast. Housing permits, which are down 28.1% from a year ago, predict the market's direction better than housing starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the National Association of Home Builders said this week that home builders' confidence fell substantially to match the lowest point in the latest economic cycle. The meltdown in subprime loans is expected to continue weighing on the sector, and high inventories will need to be worked off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Overbuilding finally looks to have stopped, but the Herculean task of making any genuine inroads into the record supply overhang . . . is only just beginning," <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> economist Richard Iley said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing figures suggest the housing market will remain a drag on economic growth in the coming months. Residential investment held back growth in the first quarter, cutting one percentage point off gross domestic product, the Commerce Department said. The impact is expected to continue through the end of the year, albeit at a slower pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Improvement in the manufacturing sector could help offset the housing woes. Industrial production overall jumped 0.7% in April after a decline of 0.3% in March, the Federal Reserve said yesterday. Capacity utilization rose to 81.6%, from a revised 81.2% in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong 0.5% increase in manufacturing could reduce the need for Fed officials to stimulate growth, as manufacturers appear to be further along than home builders in working off excess supply. The Fed has been most concerned about inflation, maintaining interest rates at the same level since last June despite concerns about sluggish growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The auto sector jumped 3.3% in a long-expected increase as auto makers cleared out inventories. Utilities increased 3.5% but were offset by a 2.8% drop in petroleum output due to refinery outages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Computers and electrical equipment gained 2%. Many companies had postponed buying computers and related equipment while awaiting <span class="companylink">Microsoft Corp.</span>'s new Vista operating system this year, analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite solid growth overall, machinery production, down 0.3% in April, should be stronger given record profits and high capacity utilization, said Daniel Meckstroth, chief economist at the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, an industry research and policy group. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. home construction rose during April, making a surprise increase despite bloated inventories and tighter credit for some borrowers, but building permits took their sharpest fall in 17 years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. industrial production rose more than expected during April as the output of motor vehicles and utilities grew at a fair clip for the month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts increased 2.5% to a seasonally adjusted 1.528 million annual rate, after rising by 0.3% in March, the U.S. Commerce Department said yesterday. That compares with the 2.2% drop that had been forecast in a survey of 24 economists by Dow Jones Newswires. Despite the unexpected increase, however, housing starts in April were down 16% from the level in April 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home builders are losing optimism, a new study suggests. The National Association of Home Builders' index for sales of new, single-family homes, which is based on a survey of builders asked about sales prospects, fell to 30 in May from 33 in April. The poorer outlook was attributed to a rise in delinquencies and tighter lending terms for borrowers with weak credit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another sign of bleaker forecasts, building permits last month fell 8.9%, to an annual rate of 1.429 million, the Commerce Department report said. It marked the biggest decline since February 1990.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve said industrial production rose 0.7% in April.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does Canary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In U.S. Economy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nest in Florida?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the housing-market shakeout has an epicenter, it probably lies in Florida. For companies with business tied closely to the state, that is a problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the boom, home prices around Miami and Tampa ran up faster than almost anywhere in the country. <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> economists note that speculative buyers in houses and, especially, condos fed a building boom that pushed Florida's housing stock up far more quickly than the state's population grew. Now, Goldman says, investors better watch Florida's woes carefully. Florida's real-estate market was probably already set up for a hangover. Then 2005's tough hurricane season made matters much worse by pushing up insurance rates along the coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speculators who have held back on selling now bear heavy costs. According to the U.S. Commerce Department, the number of vacant homes for sale in Florida doubled last year to 4.3% of the state's total housing stock. That's the highest vacancy rate in the country. As more speculators throw in the towel, Florida housing prices may have much farther to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders, hard hit everywhere, are getting hit hardest in Florida. Building permits for new-home construction -- an important leading indicator of activity -- were 51% below their year-ago level in the first quarter, according to the Commerce Department. That was twice the nationwide rate of decline for permits. Of the 10 U.S. metropolitan areas with the biggest declines in housing permits, seven are in Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida still boasts one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country. But it wouldn't be surprising to see its broader economy worsen in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big public builders have established an outsized presence in Florida. The state represented 16% of the new homes these builders delivered to buyers in 2005, according to Credit Suisse analyst Ivy Zelman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies that supply builders are feeling pinched. PGT, a company that makes impact-resistant windows and doors generated 92% of its business in Florida last year. In the first quarter, PGT's sales were 25% below year-ago levels. <span class="companylink">Florida Rock Industries</span>, a concrete and cement maker that is set to be acquired by <span class="companylink">Vulcan Materials</span>, reported that first-quarter sales were down 33%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks with exposure to Florida real estate have been getting hurt, even some far away from the state. In April, earnings at <span class="companylink">Webster Financial</span>, a Connecticut-based savings and loan, warned that credit quality on its Florida residential-construction loan portfolios had deteriorated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retailers with big exposure to the state could suffer, too, as local consumers rein in spending. <span class="companylink">MarineMax</span>, the largest U.S. recreational boat dealer, has been lowering its sales expectations. It generates more than 40% of its sales in Florida. Atlanta-based <span class="companylink">Haverty Furniture</span> has said its sales in Florida are getting hurt by the combination of the housing downturn, rising insurance rates and rising property taxes charged to out-of-state residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida has little in the way of exports, and so it is unlikely to get much help from strong global economic growth, says Goldman economist Jan Hatzius. He doesn't think the housing downturn is enough to push the whole U.S. economy into recession, but it could be a "canary in the coal mine" of trouble in regional economies.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN DIEGO -- An auction of nearly 100 foreclosed homes here Saturday showed that mortgage lenders are having to accept huge discounts in some cases to unload such properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A surge of foreclosures over the past year or so has left lenders struggling to sell a growing backlog of homes. Rather than relying on real-estate agents, the usual practice, some are turning to large-scale auctions to speed up the sale process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real Estate Disposition Corp., the Irvine, Calif., company that organized Saturday's auction of lender-owned homes, plans similar sales May 19 in Los Angeles and May 20 in Riverside, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the San Diego sale, houses and condos typically sold for about 30% below the previous sale or appraisal prices. In a few cases, the discounts were around 50%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A four-bedroom home in Oceanside, Calif., attracted a high bid of $495,000 at the auction, 33% below the sale price recorded in November 2005 for the property. One condo in San Diego sold for $120,000, less than half of its previous value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Frieden, chief executive officer of REDC, called the auction a success. About 90% of the homes offered were sold, he said. Some deals fell through because buyers couldn't qualify for financing. He estimated that 1,000 bidders attended the sale in San Diego's Convention Center, where REDC workers in tuxedos shouted and whooped in the aisles to fire up bidders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ramsey Su, a San Diego investor and former real-estate broker specializing in foreclosed properties, said prices were surprisingly low on some homes and the auction showed that "demand is not that strong."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the bidders were looking for homes to occupy themselves, but investors also turned up. Don Bickel bought two town homes in Chula Vista, Calif., that he plans to use as rental units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Diego was one of the hottest housing markets in the country in 2003 and 2004, but prices generally have been drifting lower over the past year. The soaring prices of the first half of the decade priced many people out of the market, and lenders' recent tightening of standards has made it harder for others to get loans. A glut of condominiums also is weighing on the market. Peter Dennehy, a senior vice president at Sullivan Group Real Estate Advisors, a research firm here, estimates that at the current sales rate there are enough condos on the market to last about 29 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he and many others expect the market to recover within the next few years, partly because the balmy weather here remains a big draw. "The basic fundamentals of the region are still pretty positive," Mr. Dennehy said. </p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>424 words</div><div>9 May 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of houses and condominiums available for sale continues to grow quickly in much of the U.S., reflecting weak sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes listed for sale in 18 major metropolitan areas at the end of April was up 7% from March, according to data compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a national real-estate brokerage firm in Emeryville, Calif. The data cover listings of single-family homes, condos and town houses on local multiple-listing services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase was above the seasonal norm. Over the past 22 years, home inventories nationwide have increased an average of 4.5% in April from March, according to <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group.</span> Spring is the busiest time of year for home shopping, as families with children try to get settled ahead of the next school year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the biggest increases last month were in the metro areas of San Francisco, up about 19%; Washington, 17%; Orange County, Calif., 15%; and Seattle, 14%. Inventories declined nearly 1% in the Los Angeles area, according to Zip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report issued yesterday, Ivy Zelman, a Cleveland-based housing analyst for Credit Suisse, said her building-industry contacts have been surprised by the weakness of sales recently, "given the typical seasonal bounce that occurs at this time of year." She added, "Our contacts have officially declared the spring selling season a bust." Many people who had expected a recovery by year end "now believe the market rebound will be pushed out until 2008 at the earliest," Ms. Zelman wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After booming in the first half of this decade, the housing market began cooling in much of the country in 2005. Since then, prices have been flat to declining in many areas. In recent months, an abrupt tightening of lending standards has further sapped the market by preventing some potential buyers from getting loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors yesterday again lowered its forecast, predicting that sales of previously occupied homes will total 6.29 million this year, down 2.9% from 2006. A month ago, the trade group projected that sales this year would slip 2.2%. Lawrence Yun, a senior economist for the Realtors, said many speculators have fled the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's good that we're getting beyond the tendency of some buyers to view housing as a temporary asset to accumulate short-term wealth, which is not to be expected in a normal market," he wrote. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Dean Treftz </div><div>1167 words</div><div>9 May 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing news isn't all grim. Even as prices sag nationwide, there are several cities in the country where home values are climbing smartly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Portland, Ore., Boise, Idaho, Seattle, Salt Lake City, Houston, Austin, and Charlotte and Raleigh, N.C., are among the cities bucking the national trend. Homes' appreciation there between the fourth quarters of 2005 and 2006 far exceeded the national average of 5.9%, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. In some markets, like Boise and Seattle, the appreciation jumped well into the double digits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All real estate is local, despite the headlines," says Lawrence Yun, the senior economist for the National Association of Realtors. Nationwide, the median existing-home price fell 1.3%, to $212,800 in February from $215,700 in February 2006, according to preliminary NAR statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no single secret of these cities' apparent success, but many of them missed the housing boom of the past five years. From 2001 to 2005, annual appreciation in these cities was between 2% and 5%, far slower than the 7% to 12% national average, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. (OFHEO calculates appreciation based on repeat sales or refinancings of the same single-family properties.) Now, prices are playing catch-up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the cities also have one or more strong industries to drive their economies -- colleges and technology in Raleigh, banks in Charlotte, energy in Houston and aerospace in Seattle. And all have education levels above the national average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These cities emerged from the last recession later than most of the country for various reasons, including the lagging technology, aviation and energy industries, says Mark Zandi, CEO of Moody's Economy.com. Now, their economies are strong and housing prices are still perceived as affordable, luring buyers into the market. For instance, the median sales price for a single-family home in the area of Austin-Round Rock, Texas, is $173,700, according to the National Association of Realtors, compared with $371,200 in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Miami Beach area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So many Northeasterners who moved to Florida have resettled in the Charlotte area in recent years -- both workers and retirees -- that Henry Scala and others in Charlotte refer to them as "halfbacks."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The influx may have helped Mr. Scala when he moved across town in January. "I was faced with selling this house in theoretically a down market," the 36-year resident of Charlotte says. "But there was no down market in Charlotte." Charlotte-area house prices grew 9.09% from the fourth quarter of 2005 to the fourth quarter of 2006 -- the fastest appreciation the metro area has seen since 1982, according to OFHEO. Mr. Scala got his $800,000 asking price in four days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's declining prices nationwide are in part the result of an earlier explosion of short-term investors in Florida, California and other booming markets. Recently, both investors and long-term homeowners have been cashing in or cutting losses in formerly hot markets and settling in areas that avoided the boom, such as the Carolinas, parts of Georgia and Tennessee, areas of Texas, the Western mountain states and the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're cutting and running," jokes Mark Hoover, 47 years old. Mr. Hoover and his wife, Melissa, 35, are both in the mortgage business, and they are moving from Florida to Austin to work for PRO-30, a mortgage lender based in Novato, Calif. But the Hoovers' move hasn't been easy. Their vacation home in Wellington, Fla., near West Palm Beach, has been on the market since October with a price tag of about $900,000, and their $1 million-to-$1.5 million primary home outside Fort Lauderdale, Fla., has sat since February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the Hoovers are ready for stable, low-cost, "homey" Austin, where houses appreciated at a steady 6.7% annual rate between the fourth quarters of 2004 and 2005, even as Fort Lauderdale's prices skyrocketed more than 30% before dropping off recently. The Hoovers recently paid about $400,000 for a home on five acres outside Austin and have plans to move in the next two months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growth of Portland, Salt Lake City, Boise and Seattle can be attributed in part to an influx of former Californians and people opting out of slumping Las Vegas or Phoenix. The trend may have created smaller echo booms -- especially in Boise and Salt Lake City -- which have slowed in the past several months, with each city experiencing a slow winter. Other areas, too, have experienced faster-than-average appreciation, including the New York City borough of Manhattan and New Orleans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some worry that a new group of cities could face a boom-and-bust cycle, local real-estate agents and economists predict stable growth for the near future. Since the cities have strong economies and builders, lenders and investors are increasingly cautious, homes are less likely to become extremely overvalued than in booming markets in the first half of the decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun of the National Association of Realtors predicts prices nationally will bottom out sometime this summer. Mr. Zandi, of Moody's Economy.com, isn't so sanguine. "I'd be shocked if [prices stop depreciating] this summer; it's more likely next summer," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laura Chung, an interior decorator who recently moved to Portland, Ore., from Cambridge, Mass., sees the strong market as the ultimate stress reliever. Mrs. Chung, and her husband, Eric, are considering sprucing up their new home and selling it if they find a house more to their liking -- a prospect that wasn't so simple back in Cambridge. "It's not this perpetual worry that we're not going to sell" the 2,500-square-foot house, she says. While Mrs. Chung's move to Portland had nothing to do with the housing prices, they "definitely ease the wallet a little."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After sitting on the market from June to December 2006, the Chungs' 1,200-square-foot Cambridge, Mass. townhouse condominium sold for $70,000 less than the asking price. "The number of condos in our price point was at some record high," Mrs. Chung says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To attract a buyer, their real-estate agent suggested purchasing a flat-screen TV and including it in the price of the house. When the home finally sold, the buyer didn't want the TV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">                         Location, Location 
 
  Home values are still rising in some areas. 
 
  In Portland, Ore., Seattle, Salt Lake City, Boise, Idaho, Houston, Austin, 
Charlotte and Raleigh, appreciation has exceeded the U.S. average. 
 
  These areas missed out on the recent housing boom and are now playing 
catch-up.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heavier Forces</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Two Sides</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weigh on Fed</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news for Federal Reserve policy makers is that the risks to the economy are balanced. The bad news is that the weight keeps getting heavier on both sides of the scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Fed meets today, it will in all likelihood keep its target for short-term interest rates at 5.25%, where it has been for nearly a year. Nor is it likely to change its basic stance from when it last met in March: Inflation is a concern, but economic growth is a concern, too, because of the housing downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's preferred measure of inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, has shown signs of cooling since the Fed last met. But food prices have continued to heat up, and at the pump, gasoline is north of $3 a gallon. Moreover, a weak dollar could add to inflationary pressures, because it makes foreign-made goods costlier. Prices for imported consumer goods have been rising at their fastest rate in over a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, with the jobless rate at just 4.5% and companies operating with little spare capacity, it doesn't seem like there's a lot of slack. That suggests that demand could outstrip supply. When that occurs, prices rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, looking at the economy, it doesn't seem like demand is picking up all that much. In the first quarter, gross domestic product grew at its slowest pace in four years. Consumer spending, long the bulwark of the economy, could get weighed down by high pump prices. And housing is a dead weight on growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed needs to be careful not to overweight inflation or the economy in its statement today. Otherwise, investors might think it's leaning toward some policy shift that isn't in the cards. It also needs to acknowledge that some of the facts have changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's some suggested wording: All around, things have gotten a little worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bloom Is Off the Rose</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Real-Estate Hopes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors began the year hoping the housing market would show clear signs of bottoming by the time the spring selling season got under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's under way . . . and home builders say business keeps getting worse, as the subprime-mortgage meltdown crimps sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hovnanian Enterprises last week said orders for new homes slid 30% in March and April from the previous year, after a 3% year-over-year increase in February. "Adverse publicity surrounding the subprime market has further damaged home buyers' psychology," Hovnanian said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In her monthly survey of private builders, land brokers and real estate agents, Credit Suisse analyst Ivy Zelman says 43% of her respondents said the market in April was worse than in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, investors look for signs of life at luxury builder Toll Brothers Inc., which reports preliminary results for the quarter ended April 30. In late February, Toll said demand varied week to week and there were too many soft markets to declare a "general upturn."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing reports haven't been uniformly bad. Mortgage applications for home purchases seem to have bottomed. But analysts say the recent rise in applications might be a fluke, as home buyers take out multiple applications as lending standards tighten. Expectations for a turnaround, in other words, keep fading.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Consumers' Spending Gives Economy Less of a Boost</span>
</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty </div><div>625 words</div><div>1 May 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending increased at a slower pace in March as incomes continued to post solid gains, suggesting that problems in the housing market and high gasoline prices may be making consumers more frugal -- at least temporarily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported yesterday that personal income rose 0.7% in March, the same increase as February, boosted by gains in wages and salaries. Personal-consumption expenditures increased 0.3% in March, compared with a 0.7% rise in the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The closely watched "core" personal-consumption expenditure, or PCE, figure, which excludes food and energy, was flat in March, compared with a 0.3% rise in February. Accounting for inflation, personal-consumption expenditures decreased 0.2%, the first month-to-month decline since August 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists had been counting on the continued spending of consumers, along with a pickup in exports and increased business spending, to lift second-quarter economic growth from the levels of the first quarter, when inflation-adjusted gross domestic product expanded at an annualized rate of 1.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday's report suggests that consumer spending may have weakened heading into the second quarter, which began in April. Still, some economists remain optimistic about second-quarter economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the second quarter consumers will pull back, but the good news is the pullback will be more than offset by strong growth in capital spending and exports," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at consulting firm Global Insight. Mr. Behravesh is predicting GDP growth of around 2% in the second quarter and close to 3% by year end, with consumer spending slowing to a 3% annual rate by the end of the year -- still strong but slower than the 3.8% increase in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the inflation front, yesterday's report was mostly positive. The price index for PCE increased 0.4% in March, due to higher food and energy prices, after a 0.4% gain in February. Excluding food and energy, which economists often ignore because they tend to be volatile, the PCE index was flat. Year over year, the core PCE index was running at a 2.1% annual rate, down from 2.4% in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economist have been watching inflation indicators for signs that energy and food prices would lead to broader price increases, but that hasn't happened. "Although headline inflation continues to climb, there is scant evidence of any pass-through to consumers," wrote Joseph Brusuelas, chief U.S. economist at research firm IDEAglobal, in a note to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department reported that construction spending increased 0.2% in March from the previous month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.2 trillion. The Commerce Department also revised its figures for February, reporting a gain of 1.5%, compared with the 0.3% previously reported. The revision has the potential to push up the estimate for first-quarter GDP growth, which was reported at 1.3% Friday but will be revised this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction report showed that while housing continues to be a drag, the commercial sector has been robust. Yesterday's report showed office construction was up 0.2% in March and up 27.1% year to year; lodging construction was up 12.6% on the month and 64.4% since last year. Strength in the commercial sector is one reason construction employment has remained steady.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're very focused on single-family homes, but if you broaden your view to the construction sector there is so much going on that it's almost filling the void," said Mike Englund, chief economist at Action Economics, a Boulder, Colo., research firm.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sharp drop in investment-home sales offset a record number of vacation-home purchases to bring down the overall number of second-home purchases in 2006, the National Association of Realtors reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vacation-home sales rose 4.7% to a record 1.07 million homes in 2006 from 1.02 million in 2005. Investment-home sales fell 28.9% to 1.65 million homes in 2006 from 2.32 million in 2005, according to the group's annual survey of investment- and vacation-home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of second-home sales was 36% of all existing and new residential real-estate transactions in 2006, down from 40% of all sales in 2005, the group said. Primary-residence sales fell 4.1% in 2006 to 4.82 million from 5.02 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a vacation home was $200,000 in 2006, down 2% from $204,100 in 2005. Investment-home prices were also down, with the typical home costing $150,000 last year, down 18.3% from $183,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The profile of a typical vacation-home buyer in 2006 was someone 44 years old with a median household income of $102,200, according to the NAR. Typically, these vacation homes were a median of 215 miles from the owner's primary residence, though 42% of vacation homes were closer than 100 miles and 32% were at least 500 miles away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the report, 79% of vacation-home buyers wanted the property as a vacation or family retreat, 34% wanted to use the property to diversify their investments, 28% planned to use it as a primary residence in the future, 25% were motivated by tax benefits, 22% intended for a family member or friend to use the property, 21% said they bought because they had extra money to spend, and 18% plan on renting the property to others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most popular location for the homes was in rural areas; 29% of the homes were purchased in the country. But 24% were located in resorts, 22% in a suburb and 10% in an urban area or central city. Sixty-seven percent of the homes were detached single-family houses, 21% were condos and 8% were townhouses or row houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investment-home buyers were younger and earned less than vacation-home buyers.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty </div><div>875 words</div><div>26 April 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders for computers, machinery and other business equipment rebounded in March, alleviating fears that business spending was on the verge of a sharp pullback capable of dragging down broader economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported yesterday that orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- a closely watched proxy for future business investment -- rose 4.7% in March, reversing two months of declines. More broadly, the government said orders for all durable goods -- big-ticket items designed to last more than three years -- increased 3.4% in March, compared with a gain of 2.4% in February and an 8.8% decline in January. The March gain in overall orders was fueled by the commercial-aircraft sector, which saw new orders jump 37.6% in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Bethune, a U.S. economist with consulting firm Global Insight, said that the reversal in spending on capital goods likely reflects rising demand from companies in Asia and Europe, where economic growth is strong and the value of the dollar has fallen, making U.S. exports competitively priced. "Earnings results are probably coming in better than what most companies had in their business plans," says Mr. Bethune. "Some of the hesitation about business investment or capital investment is going to start to melt away."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When January's weak new-orders report was released earlier this year, the results helped to trigger a selloff in the stock market, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sinking more than 400 points. In contrast, yesterday's better-than-expected durable-goods report helped push stock prices to new highs. The DJIA crossed 13000 to end at 13089.89, up 135.95.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the stock market's vote of confidence, some economists remained cautious about yesterday's report, and noted that, when compared with a year ago, new orders are still down. All orders were down 0.3% last month, compared with a year earlier, and orders for nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft, were down 0.6%, and they were off 15.2% in the first quarter. "The trend is still quite negative," says Conrad DeQuadros, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns Cos.</span> in New York. "You need to see another couple months [of improvement] before you can say capital-goods orders will turn the corner."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Commerce Department said sales of newly built homes increased 2.6% in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 858,000 units. While the rise was welcome news, especially following two months of sales declines, economists approached these numbers, too, with caution. New-home sales figures are notoriously volatile, and many economists believe the data overstate sales, because they don't include contracts that are signed but later canceled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at consulting firm MFR Inc. in New York, said that despite a pickup in sales, the high inventory of unsold homes will continue to put pressure on construction and house prices. Such an inventory correction, he says, is likely to cut into construction employment and consumer spending, making housing a net negative for the U.S. economy in 2007. "It's a buyer's market, people know it, and in that scenario, you wait for the price to come to you," said Mr. Shapiro.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What was encouraging to economists is that the increase in durable-goods orders was broadly based. New orders for machinery increased 4.2% in March, while primary metals increased 2.5% and fabricated-metal products increased 1.2%. Increases across so many categories suggest that businesses of all kinds are feeling slightly better about the economy's prospects going forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists speculate that the volatility in the durable-goods orders since January has been distorted by new-truck emissions standards put into place by the Environmental Protection Agency on Jan. 1. The new standards prompted some trucking companies to scramble at the end of last year to get in their orders for new trucks and engines, boosting the number for the end of 2006 and pulling down numbers at the beginning of 2007. Trucking firms say the new engines get less gas mileage, and cost more to buy and service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, the Federal Reserve reported that economic activity expanded moderately in most of the U.S., but was much better in the Northeast, Midwest and Southwest. The Federal Reserve's "beige book," a collection of anecdotal reports from the Fed's 12 regional banks prepared in advance of policy makers' May 9 meeting, noted that residential real estate remains weak across the country. One exception was New England, where home sales have shown signs of increasing, but prices remain below 2006 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also noted that wages increased in most districts, though moderately, with the largest increases among skilled workers. More broadly, consumer prices were "generally stable," but there was some risk that higher energy and commodity prices could filter into consumer prices. Manufacturing businesses in the Fed's Boston, Cleveland, Chicago and Dallas districts reported that they were raising prices to cope with higher costs, the Fed reported. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Jeff Bater and Laurence Norman   </div><div>476 words</div><div>25 April 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. existing-home sales took the biggest tumble in 18 years during March as poor weather struck demand.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. consumer confidence fell significantly in April, with a reverse in consumer optimism about present conditions leading the decline, according to a report released yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales fell to a 6.12 million annual rate, an 8.4% decrease from February's revised 6.68 million annual pace, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday. February's rate was originally estimated at 6.69 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price was $217,000 in March, compared with $213,600 in February. The March price was 0.3% below $217,600 in March 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 8.4% drop was the sharpest since 12.6% in January 1989. The NAR blamed bad winter weather. "For the last couple of months we've been expecting a weather 'hit' on home sales finalized in March," NAR chief economist David Lereah said. The drop in existing-home sales followed three increases in a row. Favorable weather in late fall and early winter had helped elevate demand.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is no question whether the weather jerked around these numbers," wrote Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics. "Remember: existing-home sales reflect closings, which can follow purchases by a month or more. Earlier month existing-home sales results reflected purchases made during the unusually warm weather in November, December and the first half of January. Some of the truly crummy weather conditions of February crept into the March sales results."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average 30-year mortgage rate was 6.16% last month, down from 6.29% in February, according to Freddie Mac.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board, a private research group, said its index of consumer confidence for April moved to 104 compared with the upwardly revised 108.2 seen in March. It was the second monthly decline in a row. Economists had expected the April reading to drop to 105, according to a survey conducted by Dow Jones Newswires.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">March's reading was originally reported at 107.2. The present-situation index, a gauge of consumers' assessment of current economic conditions, fell to 131.3 from an upwardly revised 138.5 in March. It was the first decline in six months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer expectations for the state of economic activity over the next six months slipped to 85.8 in April from an upwardly revised 87.9 the prior month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Unlike the decline in March, which was solely the result of apprehension about the short-term outlook, this month's decline was the combination of weakening expectations and a less favorable assessment of present-day conditions," said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>1357 words</div><div>25 April 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tighter credit and a growing glut of properties are depressing an already weak U.S. housing market, wrecking the industry's hopes for an early rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That leaves buyers in a strong position to negotiate for bargains during the spring home-shopping season, the busiest time of the year for housing sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday, the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of previously occupied homes in March dropped 8.4% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.12 million units -- the largest monthly drop since 1989. The trade group said the median price for homes was $217,000 in March, down 0.3% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data reflect sales that closed in March; most of those were negotiated in January and February. The Realtors said bad weather in February hurt March sales. The drop in March followed three months when home sales increased nationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since March, the market appears to have deteriorated further in many parts of the country. Reports from builders show that sales in the past few weeks "have really plunged," says Ivy Zelman, a Cleveland-based housing analyst for <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group.</span> She says prices of new homes also are falling as tighter credit eliminates some potential buyers and builders struggle to shed excess inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders, stung by a surge in defaults, have rediscovered the virtues of caution over the past few months, eliminating many of their no-money-down loan offerings. That tightening is "really starting to bite," says Ed Mixon, a real-estate agent for Re/Max Real Estate Services in Monarch Beach, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mixon recently had to advise one of his clients, a young woman with a good job and credit record, to put off her dream of buying a $300,000 condo in Laguna Niguel, Calif., until she could come up with more than her current nest egg of $5,000 for a down payment. A year ago, he says, she could easily have obtained a loan to cover 100% of the condo's price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stricter lending standards will reduce demand for housing by 10% this year from where it would have been had credit remained loose, estimates Thomas Lawler, a housing economist in Vienna, Va. He expects housing prices, as measured by the national S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index, to fall 7% in the fourth quarter of 2007 from the year-earlier level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> reported yesterday that the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller 20-city composite index in February was down 1% from a year earlier. The metro-area price changes ranged from drops of 7.8% in Detroit and 5% in San Diego to rises of 10.6% in Seattle and 7.7% in Portland, Ore. In 15 of the 20 cities, March prices were down from a month before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this has made many sellers more willing to negotiate. Shawn Gabbaie, a real-estate agent in Los Angeles who bought a new three-bedroom house in Las Vegas as an investment several years ago for about $275,000, is now trying to sell it for $299,900. He's offering to provide partial financing to a buyer, or to lease the house for $1,200 a month. Mr. Gabbaie says he's "definitely" flexible on the terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where sellers are inflexible, buyers generally will find plenty of alternatives. The Wall Street Journal's latest quarterly survey of residential real estate in major metropolitan areas -- drawn from a wide range of sources in 28 major markets -- found particularly large jumps from a year ago in listings of homes in Florida. Orlando and Tampa were both up 62%, closely followed by Miami (58%) and Jacksonville (49%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Florida's St. Lucie County, current inventory is enough to last more than 34 months at March's sales rate, says Mr. Lawler. The supply is 29 months in Palm Beach County and 25 months in both Miami-Dade and Broward counties, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other cities with big increases in listings from the already swollen levels of a year ago include Phoenix (36%), Chicago (44%), Los Angeles (54%) and Las Vegas (30%). The inventory was little changed but still plentiful in the San Diego and Washington, D.C., areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With some exceptions -- including Seattle, Houston and Manhattan -- prices generally are flat to declining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, delinquent mortgage payments -- a precursor of more foreclosures -- are on the rise. Lenders sent 46,760 default notices to California homeowners in the first three months of this year, more than double the year-earlier tally and the highest in nearly 10 years, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> Information Systems, a research firm in La Jolla, Calif. Defaults were particularly prevalent in Sacramento, Riverside and San Joaquin counties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using nationwide data, Moody's Economy.com, a research firm in West Chester, Pa., found that Miami, Houston and Orlando all had big jumps in the proportion of borrowers who were behind on loan payments in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all delinquent payments or defaults lead to foreclosures, of course, but most experts are expecting a sizable increase in foreclosures over the next year or two as home prices weaken. That will add to the glut of homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In areas near new construction, sellers of older homes are up against builders determined to cut prices as much as necessary to shed inventory. "We're marking our inventory to market across the country," Donald Tomnitz, chief executive of <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc.</span>, said in a conference call with analysts last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lennar Corp.</span>, another big builder, is experimenting by offering a couple dozen new homes in the Palm Springs, Calif., area for auction on RealtyBid.com. For one group of Lennar condos in La Quinta, Calif., originally priced at around $430,000, bids were between $251,000 and $257,000 yesterday. The auction ends May 8.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boston, which started to weaken three years ago, is now showing signs of stabilizing. In March, area listings were down 11% from the bloated level of a year before. Agreements to buy homes in the first 23 days of April totaled 1,894, up 2.8% from a year earlier, according to MLS Property Information Network Inc. in Shrewsbury, Mass., but the median price in the latest period edged down 1.2% from a year earlier, to $415,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the strongest markets have recently shown signs of modest cooling. In the Portland, Ore., area, listings in March totaled 10,557, up 87% from a year earlier, according to Regional Multiple Listing Service, which operates the multiple-listing service there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Houston area, where oil-industry strength has buoyed demand, March listings rose 12% from a year earlier to 37,671. Pending sales edged up 2.7% from a year earlier, and the median price for single-family homes stood at about $151,000, up 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan remains strong. Real-estate broker <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span> says home listings there totaled 8,234 in March, down 11% from a year earlier. That shrinking inventory reflects a surge in sales in the first quarter, when the median price for condos and co-op apartments increased 1.2% to $835,000, says Jonathan Miller, chief executive of Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller says Wall Street bonuses and hedge-fund profits are fueling the market, while the weaker dollar attracts European buyers. But listings on Long Island and in the New York borough of Queens totaled 31,954, up 18%, according to the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors are looking for reasons to be hopeful, but few expect a rapid turnaround. In Vero Beach, Fla., the condo supply is enough to last more than 33 months at the current sales rate, says Sally Daley, owner of Daley &amp;Co. Real Estate. Even so, she says more people are out looking for bargains. "We really think the worst is over," she says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales fell to a 6.12 million annual rate in March, a 8.4% decrease from February's revised 6.68 million annual pace, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday. The median home price was $217,000 in March, compared with $213,600 in February and $217,600 in March 2006. Economists debate whether this is a correction due to bad weather or a broader indication of weakness.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This looks awful but it is surely just the reversal of the favorable weather effects which boosted Jan &amp; Feb sales. After two months above the level implied by the pending sales index, March activity has undershot. . . Sales depend on what happens both to the level of mortgage applications and the terms on which applications are granted. In the wake of the subprime blowup, it seems reasonable to expect a higher application rejection rate and tighter terms, but they are not visible yet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Ian Shepherdson, High Frequency Economics   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broad-based nature of the sales weakness suggests that this is more than just a weather story. . . The median sales price rose 1.6% in March, but is down 0.3% from a year earlier. However, as we have stressed in the past, this measure can be heavily influenced by shifts in the mix of home sold. A better gauge of underlying home price trends -- the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index -- shows a steady deterioration in home values in recent months and is now down 1% from last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Morgan Stanley Research   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ugly is the simplest word for this report. The housing market is still in the tank and while every time we get a huge decline in sales we move closer to the bottom, it is hardly obvious when we will actually see that bottom.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Naroff Economic Advisors   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though lower sales were widely expected to offset the unexpected strength of earlier months, the breadth and depth of this decline leaves little doubt that the housing sector remains in the doldrums with a turnaround not yet on the horizon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Nomura Economics Research   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak data correcting last month's quirky lurch higher . . . Lead indicators such as mortgage applications and the NAHB survey suggest resales may now flatten out in the short term at least.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Richard Iley, BNP Paribas   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sluggish sales have kept inventories of unsold homes at very high levels. This, in turn, has pressured prices, which have been falling for the past 8 months. Although home sales appear to be stabilizing, the housing correction is not complete and home construction will continue to shrink until more of the inventory overhang is eliminated.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A sharp drop in apparel prices and soft gains in housing and medical costs kept underlying inflation in the U.S. in check last month, a government report showed, though overall inflation accelerated on the back of higher energy prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, home construction unexpectedly climbed in March and permits for future building posted the first increase in three months, a sign of hope for the struggling housing sector.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data suggest the status quo on official interest rates, with inflation still uncomfortably high but not so much of a worry to trigger rate increases amid signs of weaker economic growth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer prices rose 0.6% in March, the U.S. Labor Department said, up from February's 0.4% rise. But the core consumer-price index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, advanced just 0.1%, half the previous month's increase.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures support the prevailing view among economists that Federal Reserve officials will keep official interest rates unchanged when they meet next month. The Fed has kept the federal-funds rate steady at 5.25% since last summer. Financial markets expect the Fed's next move to be a rate cut later this year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, a rate reduction seems unlikely until inflation shows a more marked deceleration. Consumer prices were 2.8% higher than a year earlier, according to yesterday's report, while core prices advanced 2.5% from a year ago, down from last year's peak of 2.9%. Over the past three months, the core CPI has risen at a 2.3% annualized rate.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal-consumption-expenditures price index, is running at a 2.4% annual clip through February, well above the 2% level that is considered the top end of the Fed's comfort zone.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy prices last month increased by 5.9%. Gasoline prices jumped 11%. Natural-gas prices advanced 3%, while electricity prices rose 0.5%. Food prices, meanwhile, increased 0.3%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clothing prices fell 1%, matching the steepest drop since September 1998.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, housing starts increased 0.8% to a seasonally adjusted 1.518 million annual rate, after rising by 7.6% in February, the U.S. Commerce Department said. Originally, February starts were seen increasing by 9% to 1.525 million. Year-to-year, housing starts were 23% lower than the level in March 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits last month rose by 0.8% to a 1.544 million annual rate.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. industrial production fell more than expected during March as utilities output plunged on unseasonably warm weather, while durable-goods manufacturing picked up during the month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production fell 0.2%, the Fed said. Output increased 0.8% in February, revised down from a previously estimated 1% increase. Capacity utilization fell to 81.4%. February capacity use was 81.6%, revised down from 82%.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty </div><div>714 words</div><div>18 April 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest batch of economic data provided an upbeat assessment of the nation's economy, suggesting that higher energy prices aren't fueling broader inflation and that the manufacturing and construction sectors are picking up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though all three of yesterday's reports were better than expected, economists cautioned that they don't necessarily mean economic growth, which is believed to have slowed significantly during the first quarter, is about to accelerate again. The Commerce Department will report first-quarter growth figures later this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless the reports amounted to a "silver lining amidst clouds of uncertainty," said Joseph Brusuelas, chief U.S. economist at research firm IDEAglobal in New York. "It looks like we're reaching a turning point. We want to believe it, but we're not sure."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The parade of economic indicators began with the consumer-price index, the most closely watched measure of inflation, which rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in March, following a 0.4 % rise in February. The index was pushed higher by a 5.9% jump in energy prices, the largest one-month gain since September 2005, which increased the cost of gasoline and home heating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the "core" CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, gave economists much to be pleased about. Core consumer prices rose 0.1% in March, less than February's 0.2% gain. The core index was pulled down by hotel-room rates, which fell 2.3%, and apparel prices, which dropped 1.0%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have been paying close attention to food and energy prices to see if businesses are passing along higher costs to consumers. They are also watching to see if high energy prices are pinching consumers, forcing them to spend more on getting to and from work and limiting what they have left over for such things as a trip to the movies or the shopping mall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, there is little evidence either trend is occurring in a significant way. The Commerce Department reported on Monday that retail sales excluding gasoline rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in March, the same as February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, overall inflation is higher than a year ago. For the first three months of the year, prices rose at a 4.7% annual rate, almost double the 2.5% rate for all of 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday's CPI report "will ease some inflation fears at the [Federal Reserve] but, at the same time, it's unlikely we're going to see a sustained pullback in core inflation," said David Greenlaw, chief U.S. fixed-income economist at Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department reported that housing starts rose a stronger-than-expected 0.8% in March to an annual rate of 1.52 million units. The gain, due entirely to construction in the Midwest, was the second consecutive monthly increase and compares with a 7.7% jump in February. Compared with March 2006, however, housing starts were down 23%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists attributed the month-to-month rise to warmer March weather, which prompted companies to start construction that had been postponed in February due to bad weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, an indicator of future construction activity, increased to an annual rate of 1.54 million in March, also up 0.8%, compared with a decrease of 2.5% in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities declined 0.2% in March, compared with a 0.8% increase in February. The March decline was due to a cutback at utilities, which ramped up their production in chilly February and eased off when temperatures increased in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing sector was the report's standout: Factory production rose 0.7% in March, up from a 0.1% increase in February. The gain reflected strong production of machinery, which rose 1.0%, and computers and electronics, which were up 2.0%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don Norman, economist for the trade group Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, said the increase was fueled in part by economic growth in Europe, which prompted companies there to spend more money on U.S.-made products. Exports are "certainly contributing to the resumption of growth in manufacturing," said Mr. Norman. </p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>880 words</div><div>12 April 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors, which has long proclaimed that U.S. home prices haven't declined on a nationwide basis since the Great Depression, now says they are likely to do just that this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors, which had been projecting as recently as February a 1.9% increase in the median home price this year, now say prices for previously occupied homes will slip 0.7% this year from the 2006 level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade group's revised outlook, which puts it in line with a growing consensus that home prices will fall at least modestly this year, underlines how quickly expectations about the market have changed in light of a recent tightening of credit by mortgage lenders. Before the subprime mortgage problems blew up recently, said Lawrence Yun, an economist for the Realtors, the group expected the housing market to begin recovering by the middle of this year. Now, he says, recovery is unlikely before late this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, the median price rose 1.1% from a year earlier to $222,000, even though the monthly median prices reported in the second half of 2006 were down modestly from year-earlier months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, the Realtors' chief economist, says he revised downward the 2007 forecast because of tighter lending standards that have taken effect over the past few months in the wake a steep rise in defaults on subprime-mortgage loans, which are loans made to people with weak credit records or high debt in relation to income. The more cautious stance of lenders will mean some people who want to buy homes will find it impossible to get loans on reasonable terms. At the same time, a rise in foreclosures will add supply to housing markets that are already glutted in much of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Lawler, a housing economist in Vienna, Va., expects an even steeper fall, of 4.3%, in the median price of houses this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices won't fall throughout the country, of course. Home prices generally have been falling in parts of Southern California, Arizona, Nevada, Florida, the Rust Belt states and Massachusetts. But they have continued to rise in some cities, including Houston, Portland, Seattle and New York, where job growth has been relatively strong and supplies of unsold homes generally lean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling prices make it tricky for buyers and sellers, accustomed to adding a few percentage points to last year's levels, to figure out how much a home should fetch now. Christopher J. Olsen, a financial planner in Lodi, Calif., has been renting for the past couple of years in anticipation of lower prices. But he now yearns to get his family into their own home, even though prices could fall further. Mr. Olsen says he has agreed to pay $505,000 for a four-bedroom home that he thinks might have sold for $700,000 two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors also cut their forecast of sales of previously occupied homes in 2007 to 6.34 million from the 6.42 million projected a month earlier and 6.44 million two months before. In 2006, home sales totaled 6.48 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Mortgage Bankers Association suggested that the media's intense focus on the housing crunch, and shoot-from-the-hip responses from legislators and regulators, threatened to make the situation worse. In an email Tuesday, the association told its members that it has allocated an extra $5 million to combat "a torrent of unfair press and counterproductive policy responses" sparked by the turmoil in the subprime market, where dozens of lenders have been forced to close down or seek bankruptcy protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Misleading information, often reinforced by vivid and frightening anecdotes, is raising the very real possibility of overzealous regulatory and legislative responses," the association wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $5 million budget for extra advertising, research and lobbying is equivalent to about 10% of the trade group's annual budget. The association said it is trying "to shift the media focus away from the 'foreclosure crisis' to the potential for a 'credit crunch' that could result from over-legislation and over-regulation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Howard Glaser, a Washington-based industry consultant and former lobbyist for the MBA, says the association's planned campaign suggests that "they're not in touch with the reality of what's happening in the marketplace." Mr. Glaser, who last year helped to set up an association for midsize mortgage banks, the National Alliance of Independent Mortgage Bankers, says the MBA should talk about solutions rather than attacking critics. "Blaming the press for the troubles in the mortgage industry is a nonstarter," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug Duncan, the MBA's chief economist, says the group isn't blaming the media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sharp increase in homes offered for sale last month suggests that home shoppers will find plenty of choices this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes listed for sale in 18 major U.S. metropolitan areas at the end of March increased 6.5% from a month earlier, according to data compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a national real-estate brokerage firm in Emeryville, Calif. The data cover listings of single-family homes, condominiums and town houses on local multiple-listing services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past 22 years, home inventories nationwide have increased an average of 1.7% in March from February, according to <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group.</span> Supplies typically rise modestly in March as sellers pursue the many families with children who seek new homes in the spring, so they can move during summer vacations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big rise in the latest month may reflect sellers' expectations that it will take much longer to find buyers than it did during the housing boom of the first half of this decade, said Patrick Lashinsky, president of ZipRealty. Rather than waiting for April or May, he said, many people planning to move this summer put their homes up for sale in March. He added that many sellers are being cautious, waiting to sell their old homes before committing to buy new ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ZipRealty recorded the biggest increases in the metro areas of Los Angeles (12.8%), San Francisco (12.2%) and Washington, D.C. (9.4%). Miami, where a glut of unsold condos has been weighing on the market, showed a modest rise of 1.8% in the supply of all types of homes in March from a month before. But the Miami inventory was up 61% from a year earlier. For all 18 metro areas, the inventory at the end of March was up 35% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large inventories have caused prices to level off or fall modestly in much of the country over the past year or so. The recent surge in defaults on subprime mortgages -- loans to people with blemished credit records -- has prompted lenders to tighten credit standards. That tightening is expected to put downward pressure on home prices by removing many potential buyers from the market. </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Why Icahn Is Betting on WCI's Florida Condos</span>
</div><div class="author">By Michael Corkery </div><div>1200 words</div><div>5 April 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid softening home prices, rising foreclosures and turmoil in the mortgage industry, billionaire financier Carl Icahn is making a contrarian bet on a troubled pocket of the U.S. housing market: high-end Florida condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How Mr. Icahn fares with his wager could help answer whether this state's housing downturn is a cloud that will soon blow over or a storm that will linger for years. The board of <span class="companylink">WCI Communities Inc.</span>, a home builder that has erected hundreds of high-rise condos along the Florida coast, could decide today whether to accept Mr. Icahn's tender offer of $22 a share for the builder that many consider a good barometer for the state's priciest real estate. That offer, which totals about $920 million, is slightly higher than WCI's $21.45 price yesterday in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Icahn's pursuit of WCI has puzzled many on Wall Street who believe the Bonita Springs, Fla., company is highly exposed to the swelling glut of condos dotting Florida beaches and golf courses. In the fourth quarter, WCI, which has a market value of about $909 million, had more defaults on condos and cancellations of typical single-family homes, which it also builds, than it received orders for new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Icahn appears to be counting on Florida real estate to make a comeback. "My investment philosophy, generally, with exceptions, is to buy something when no one wants it," he said yesterday. "We made a fairly large investment and took control of several energy companies seven or eight years ago when they were way down. Housing is somewhat analogous."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Icahn, who has put up a slate of nominees for the WCI board, declines to comment on what, if any, plans he has for the company. In a Jan. 16 Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr. Icahn said he beneficially held 14.5%, or 6.1 million shares, in WCI and that he intended to contact the company to discuss how to "unlock the inherent value" of its shares. His tender offer is conditioned on the WCI board pulling its recently enacted poison-pill provision intended to ward off hostile takeovers. WCI declined to comment, citing a "quiet period" after the tender offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview before he made his March 23 tender offer, he said, "On a medium- to long-term basis, there are a lot of factors that will help Florida." Among them: Baby boomers reaching retirement age are moving south.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With prices as high as $11 million for some prime units, WCI condos seem suited to wealthy buyers. WCI also boasts a large amount of undeveloped land across Florida, with many parcels located near its current developments. Some investors believe that land will prove valuable when the Florida market recovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Icahn's offer comes at a crucial time for WCI and for the Florida condo market, generally. The company is expected to open about 10 condo developments across Florida this year. Many of the units within these developments were sold to investors several years ago, as the speculative market roared along. Now those buyers are choosing whether to close on their units and move in, or walk away from hefty deposits, or try to resell their condos in a softening market. WCI buyers put down average deposits of 18% on units with an average sales price of $1.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the speculative overhang of newly constructed single-family homes may have peaked in some markets across the country, the full force of Florida's condo glut is still unfolding because, in many cases, it has taken two to three years to complete the high-rise buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Miami-Dade County alone, 8,000 condo units are expected to open this year, while an additional 12,000 units will open in 2008, followed by 5,500 units in 2009, says Jack McCabe, a housing consultant based in Deerfield Beach, Fla. Fewer than 11,000 condos were built in Miami-Dade between 1995 and 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not a pretty picture," Mr. McCabe says. "This stuff was built five years too soon. The first real wave of baby boomers will retire in 2010 and Florida is going to be one of the most vibrant markets. But before that, we are going to see a lot of people lose money."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many investors agree. As of March 15, WCI was among the most heavily shorted stocks, with short interest comprising 55% of its float.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short sellers bet that a stock price will fall. Many short investors are betting WCI will be hit by a wave of defaults, as buyers walk away from their deposits or buyers try to rescind their contracts through lawsuits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have a dire situation," says Credit Suisse analyst Ivy Zelman, who has a "sell" rating on WCI. "There is too much inventory, not enough sales and price deflation. It's the perfect storm."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles May put down a $315,000 deposit on a WCI condo in Bal Harbour, near Miami, in December 2003. Before he decided to buy the approximately $1.55 million condo he says WCI sent a limousine to his house, delivering champagne and fancy bathrobes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years later, the condo tower isn't finished and Mr. May expects he will have to resell for a loss. Mr. May is suing the company to get his deposit back, claiming the project is behind schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WCI says its default rate, or rate of condo buyers who don't close on their unit and walk away from a deposit, this year may rise above its historical average of about 2%, but it doesn't expect that rate to exceed 10%. While on the rise, that measurement is much lower than what many other builders are experiencing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other builders have higher cancellations, in part because they require smaller deposits for single-family homes. Buyers of WCI units have been more reluctant to walk away from their bigger deposits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A surge in defaults could be especially painful for WCI because the company needs cash to pay down its debt. WCI's debt-to-capital is roughly 66%, compared with an average of 44% among other builders, says Credit Suisse's Ms. Zelman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, some analysts say WCI could limp along collecting as much cash as it can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One source is the deposits that the company gets to keep when buyers walk. Some analysts also believe Mr. Icahn could refinance the company's debt and possibly sell off some of its land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Zilbert, a Miami real-estate agent who runs a Web site called the CondoSuperCenter, acknowledges the moment of reckoning for Florida's high-end condo market is approaching. "The big question on everyone's mind is: Where will all the buyers come from?" he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zilbert shares Mr. Icahn's bullish long-term view, noting that resales have been picking up in recently opened condo towers around Miami, including WCI's Mosaic tower, a chic high-rise development in Miami Beach. </p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>588 words</div><div>4 April 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of borrowers in the U.S. falling behind on the riskier types of home mortgages continues to grow, according to new data from First American Loan Performance, a research firm in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rapid rise in overdue payments and defaults has forced dozens of lenders out of business or into bankruptcy protection in recent months and darkened the outlook for the U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday, the National Association of Realtors reported that its index of pending U.S. home sales in February stood at 109.3, down 8.5% from a year earlier but up 0.7% from January. The index, which equates the 2001 sales level to 100, is based on home-purchase agreements that haven't yet been completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The First American data show that in January payments were at least 60 days late on 14.3% of "subprime" loans that had been packaged into securities, up from 13.4% in December and 8.4% in January 2006. Subprime loans are those made to borrowers with weak credit records or large debts in relation to their incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Alt-A loans -- a category between prime and subprime that includes many loans that don't require full documentation of the borrower's income or assets -- the late-payment figure rose to 2.6% in January from 2.3% in December and 1.3% in January 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As more borrowers fall behind or default, lenders are beginning to clamp down. Many of them have eliminated no-money-down loans for subprime borrowers and are insisting on seeing pay stubs, tax forms or other evidence of income. That means many potential borrowers are likely to be turned down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subprime lending could decline by as much as 50% this year from last year's total of about $600 billion, says David Liu, a mortgage analyst at UBS AG in New York. Alt-A lending also is expected to fall sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Together, subprime and Alt-A accounted for nearly 40% of the U.S. home-mortgage loans originated last year, according to Moody's Economy.com, a research firm based in West Chester, Pa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overdue payments and defaults will get worse in the months ahead, warns Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, in a recent report. For one thing, he notes, many borrowers will face higher monthly payments in the next couple of years as their loans "reset" to higher rates from their low introductory "teaser" rates. Because of tighter lending standards, many won't be able to refinance into loans with easier terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of foreclosures in the U.S. is likely to reach a record 1.3 million this year, compared with an estimated 900,000 in 2006, Mr. Zandi says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures will cause more homes to be dumped on the market at discount prices at a time when inventories of unsold homes already are high in much of the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, Mr. Zandi predicts, the median price for sales of previously occupied homes will fall nearly 5% this year, which would mark the biggest national drop since the Depression of the 1930s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As recently as January, he expected a more modest drop of 2.5%. Price changes vary greatly by region and even by neighborhood, of course. Prices are falling in some areas but still rising in others. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- It's good news for landlords and bad news for renters. U.S. apartment rents went up a robust 1% in the first quarter, with only a slight 0.1% increase in vacancy to 6% nationwide, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc.</span>, a New York real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers show apartment owners continue to benefit from weakness in the for-sale housing market, as would-be homebuyers wait out possible further declines in house prices. Sam Chandan, Reis's chief economist, says apartment owners will benefit even more as the tightening of subprime lending closes the door to many first-time homeowners who are currently renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 79 markets that Reis tracks, only Colorado Springs, Colo., showed a decline in rents, down 0.1%. Rents rose the most in Miami, Seattle, and San Jose, Calif., all up 1.6% in the first quarter. Orlando saw the biggest increase in vacancy as apartments originally slated for condominium conversions streamed back on the market as rentals. Vacant apartments there jumped 0.7 percentage points to 5.6% in the first quarter.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty </div><div>510 words</div><div>31 March 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising incomes and a sturdy labor market kept consumers spending on everything from socks to restaurant meals in February, helping offset the housing slump. The buoyancy of consumer spending and a whiff of inflation are likely to discourage the Federal Reserve from any near-term move to lower interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's Commerce Department report was a welcome sign of economic vitality. Consumer spending will likely be the economy's driving force through at least the first half of the year. Strength in consumer spending is particularly important with the continuing housing recession and recent signs that businesses are holding off on investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government said personal income rose 0.6% in February, following a 1% increase the month before. Consumer spending also increased 0.6% -- double economists' forecasts -- compared with a 0.5% increase in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a note to clients, Stephen Stanley, chief economist at <span class="companylink">RBS Greenwich Capital</span>, said income results were solid given February's cold weather and spate of snowstorms. "The continued firmness in the labor market is still generating nice income growth, helping to underpin the consumer, much needed in light of evaporating housing wealth gains and higher energy prices," he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, a separate report on consumer spirits suggested they may be tiring a bit. The Reuters/University of Michigan consumer-sentiment index fell to 88.4 in March from 91.3 in February, pulled down by concerns about housing, gasoline prices and the stock market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's report from Commerce showed core consumer prices excluding food and energy, closely watched by the Fed and the markets, rose 0.3% in February and 2.4% year over year. This will make it hard for the Fed to contemplate dropping its rhetorical bias against inflation, much less lowering interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For months the Fed has been trying to balance an economy that is slowing even as inflation increases. Officials generally expect inflation as measured by the core price index to come in between 2% and 2.25% this year, a prediction that depends on stable energy prices and slower growth in rent and housing costs. But even if that occurs, core inflation will be above the Fed's unofficial ceiling of 2%. In a speech this past week, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Michael Moskow warned, "Inflation has run above 2% for the past three years." He added: "We have to recognize the risk that inflation expectations could become stuck in a range that would not be conducive to price stability."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the government said spending on residential construction took another slide in February. Residential-construction spending fell by 1% to $570.9 billion in February, the Commerce Department said. However, the drop was offset by a 2.3% increase in private nonresidential construction, a broad category that includes everything from schools to power plants. That drove a 0.3% increase in overall construction spending, the largest gain since 1% in March 2006. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending and Saving?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data on personal income, spending, saving and costs will provide key signals on consumers, the biggest driver of economic growth. The consensus forecast calls for personal income and personal spending to both rise a moderate 0.3% for February. The Fed, in its vigilance against inflation, will closely watch the change in the Personal Consumption Expenditure price index, which has been topping its desired year-over-year ceiling of 2%. The saving rate is expected to remain in negative territory. Commerce Department data at 8:30 a.m. EDT.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending data are expected to highlight the divergent fortunes of various slices of the building industry. While residential construction spending has taken a pounding -- dragging down the overall numbers for months -- business spending has been brisk. Government construction spending is even stronger, with a double-digit annual pace of growth. Commerce Department releases February data at 10 a.m. EDT.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The benchmark 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage average was unchanged in the week ended yesterday at 6.16%, according to Freddie Mac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage agency said its weekly survey showed the 15-year loan decreased to 5.86% from 5.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one-year Treasury-indexed adjustable-rate rose to 5.43% from 5.4%, while the five-year hybrid ARM averaged 5.88%, down from 5.91% last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Recent data releases sent conflicting signals about the direction of the housing market," said Frank Nothaft, Freddie Mac chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The rise in existing home sales in February to a 6.69 million unit pace, the highest level since last April, offered some hope of firming in housing demand. In contrast, February's new-home sales fell unexpectedly to 848,000 units, the slowest pace since June 2000, suggesting that more time will be needed before a housing recovery takes place."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A poor report on new-home sales in February sharpened bids for government bonds as investors put more money on the prospect of a rate cut in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 3 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note rose 6/32 point, or $1.875 per $1,000 face value, at 100 9/32. Its yield fell to 4.589% from 4.613% on Friday, as yields move inversely to prices. The two-year note, the most sensitive to rate changes, rose 2/32 point to 100 10/32 to yield 4.574%, leaving the yield curve just slightly positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disappointing housing-market report was a boon for Treasury bulls, who have thrived recently on the view that the Federal Reserve will have to hasten toward a rate cut as the housing sector's troubles deepen, threatening to infect the rest of the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Futures markets illustrate the heightened expectations. Approaching the close, the June Eurodollars contract was pricing in a roughly 60% chance for the Fed to cut its target rate a quarter percentage point, to 5%, in the second quarter. This is up from about a 56% chance at Friday's close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its last monetary-policy statement March 21, the central bank abandoned its previous explicit reference to the possible need for higher interest rates. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael Corkery </div><div>758 words</div><div>27 March 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new U.S. homes declined for the second consecutive month in February, and the nation's supply of unsold homes continued to rise, an indication that the weak housing market has yet to hit bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported yesterday that sales of newly constructed single-family homes fell 3.9% last month to an annual pace of 848,000 units. That rate was 18.3% below a year earlier and followed a decline of 16% in January from the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is no question that after thinking we had a stabilization of new-homes sales late last year, we are in another down leg," said David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. "I think fundamental demand has weakened."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month's sales pace was likely chilled by snowstorms in the Northeast and Midwest, where sales plunged. But some economists said the recent pullback by subprime-mortgage lenders -- companies that make home loans to people with weak credit -- may also be driving down demand. And the decline is occurring just as the critical spring selling season gets under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the nation's large publicly traded home builders, the percentage of homes sold to subprime borrowers varies widely. The builders say they don't track all subprime mortgages -- only those made through their in-house mortgage units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such subprime loans range from 1% to 2% of mortgages made by Miami-based <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp.</span> to 18% of loans originated and brokered last year at <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc.</span>, based in Red Bank, N.J. However, many builders say outside lenders may account for a higher overall percentage of subprime mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a recent survey, the NAHB found that a third of the nation's home builders said the tighter lending standards many lenders have adopted in response to rising defaults in the subprime sector are hurting their sales. On average, the builders who are feeling the credit tightening said sales were down 15% due to stricter loan practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other economists, however, said it may be too early to conclude that a credit crunch is driving down home sales, and they note that other data have suggested that the housing market is improving. Last week, for example, the National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned homes in February rose 3.9% from the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conflicting reports could reflect weather distortions. Even though the data are seasonally adjusted, unusual weather conditions still may have skewed the results. Last week's report on existing-home sales reflects purchase agreements that were mostly signed in December and early January, when parts of the nation were experiencing unusually warm weather. By contrast, the sales report on new homes reflects contracts signed in February, when weather was colder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reports could also reflect shifting home-buying habits. Faced with tighter credit and slower price appreciation, more buyers may be choosing the less expensive, previously owned homes rather than pricier new homes. The median price of previously owned homes was $212,800 in February, compared with a median new-home price of $250,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In a down market, people aren't looking to get into the most expensive home," says Richard DeKaser, chief economist at <span class="companylink">National City Corp.</span> in Cleveland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say declining demand for new homes could weigh more heavily on the broader economy, as builders cut back even further on construction to reduce the swelling supply of unsold homes. The inventory of new homes on the market rose to an 8.1 months supply in February, up from 7.3 months the previous month, the Commerce Department said. The NAR said last week the supply of existing homes also rose last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Production is going to be weaker than we thought not long ago, and the impact more serious" for economic output, said Mr. Seiders, the NAHB economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales in February were down 26.8% from the previous month in the Northeast, down 20% in the Midwest and down 7% in the South. They were up 24.6% in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, home builders are growing more pessimistic about the housing market. The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index, which measures builders' confidence in the market, fell three points this month from a downwardly revised reading of 39 in February. That followed several months of increases in the index. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence is expected to have fallen in March from February, when the index reached its highest level since August 2001. After four months of gains, buoyed by the strong job market and lower gas prices, housing-market jitters and stock market volatility appear to be damping the mood.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously occupied homes in the U.S. rose unexpectedly last month, but economists said the increase was partly driven by unseasonably warm weather and didn't fully reflect the current turmoil in the subprime-mortgage market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent surge in defaults on subprime mortgages, those for people with weaker credit records, has forced lenders to tighten their standards. That is expected to eliminate many potential home buyers, damping sales in the months ahead.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes increased 3.9% in February from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.69 million units. That sales rate was 3.6% below the year-earlier level.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest data reflect completions of home sales in February that resulted from purchase agreements that were mostly signed in December and early January, when unusually warm weather in the Northeast may have enticed more people to shop for homes. The Northeast led the nation with a 14.2% surge in sales in February from a month earlier, while sales increased 1.6% in the South and 3.9% in the Midwest. They were unchanged in the West.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously occupied homes in the U.S. rose unexpectedly last month, but economists said the increase was partly driven by unseasonably warm weather and didn't fully reflect the current turmoil in the subprime-mortgage market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent surge in defaults on subprime mortgages, those for people with weaker credit records, has forced lenders to tighten their standards. That is expected to eliminate many potential home buyers, damping sales in the months ahead.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes increased 3.9% in February from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.69 million units. That sales rate was 3.6% below the year-earlier level.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest data reflect completions of home sales in February that resulted from purchase agreements that were mostly signed in December and early January, when unusually warm weather in the Northeast may have enticed more people to shop for homes. The Northeast led the nation with a 14.2% surge in sales in February from a month earlier, while sales increased 1.6% in the South and 3.9% in the Midwest. They were unchanged in the West.

Mr. Lawler said it was the second month in a row that the NAR has revised the year-earlier median price downward.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts say price cuts and low interest rates are bringing buyers back into the market, which helped boost sales in February and in the previous month.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our view had been that sales were going to turn around in middle of '07," said Patrick Newport, economist at consultancy Global Insight. "But I don't think that is going to happen because a segment of the home-buying market is not going to be able to borrow money."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of homes for sale rose 5.9% to 3.75 million at the end of February, which represents a 6.7-month supply at the current sales pace. That's down from a 7.4-month supply in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the number of homes on the market typically increases in February as the peak spring selling season kicks off. In some markets, rising foreclosures threaten to worsen the glut of homes offered for sale. Credit Suisse analyst Ivy Zelman estimates that foreclosures could add as much as 20% to the current inventory of existing homes. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp;Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">C-Bass, characterized in Friday's Ahead of the Tape column as a subprime-mortgage servicer, also is an issuer and investor in a variety of credit-sensitive residential mortgage assets, which include subprime mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ March 24, 2007)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END) </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subprime Unit</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proves Taxing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For <span class="companylink">H&amp;R Block</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax season is a time of frantic, sweaty-palmed filers trying to beat the mid-April deadline. The clock is also ticking -- for a different reason -- on a company that will handle many of those forms: <span class="companylink">H&amp;R Block.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Ernst, chief executive of the tax preparer, has said repeatedly the company will announce whether it has reached a deal to sell <span class="companylink">Option One Mortgage Corp.</span> by the end of March. But it may have to lower its $1.3 billion asking price on the unit, which deals in risky subprime mortgages, if it wants to cut a deal by then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In regulatory filings, <span class="companylink">H&amp;R Block</span> said Option One's delinquency rate in its fiscal third quarter ended Jan. 31 rose to 11.2% from 5.6% last year. Because of a jump in defaults, the lender recorded loan-loss provisions of $111.1 million, a nearly 750% increase from $13.1 million a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of those delinquencies, 84% were on loans written during previous quarters, indicating that <span class="companylink">H&amp;R Block</span> had sharply underestimated the increase in defaults -- and raising questions about whether loan-loss provisions will have to be raised again, diminishing the value of the company. "There are likely to be more provisions in the future, and you would think an astute buyer would know that," said Donn Vickrey, co-founder of equity research firm Gradient Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the subprime tumult, prospective buyers will be cautious -- with reason. Kathleen Shanley, an analyst with independent debt boutique Gimme Credit, points to the $259 million planned purchase of subprime lender Fieldstone Investment by C-Bass, a subprime-mortgage servicer. Soon after the announcement of the deal in February, C-Bass cut the offer by more than 25% because it had to provide Fieldstone with funds during a credit crunch, a sign of the surprises that lurk in subprime land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pressure is building as the unit drags on <span class="companylink">H&amp;R Block</span>'s stock, down 12% since the end of January. Last week, <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> said it may downgrade its credit rating on <span class="companylink">H&amp;R Block</span>'s ability to meet certain financial obligations due to the impact of Option One's mortgage operations. That puts greater pressure on <span class="companylink">H&amp;R Block</span> to unload Option One, as a downgrade could pinch other parts of the H&amp;R empire, according to UBS Investment Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tick tock, tick tock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-Sale Surprise:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Size of Drop May Shock</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not many will be surprised today if they find out that real-estate brokers sold fewer homes last month than in January, given the tumult in the housing market. But they could get surprised by how far sales slid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires estimate the National Associations of Realtors will report sales of previously owned homes fell 3% last month. Such a drop would be roughly in line with the NAR's index of pending home sales, which fell 4.1% in January. Pending home sales, based on how many sales contracts sellers have accepted, lead existing sales, which are based on sales that have actually closed. Agreeing to a sale isn't the same as closing it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worries about subprime mortgages have yet to be fully reflected in housing data. There may have been more would-be buyers last month unable to get the loan they wanted, causing agreed-to sales to fall through. If existing home sales fell more sharply than the index of pending home sales suggested, it will be a sign that the subprime problems have come home to roost.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home construction rebounded last month after a sharp drop in January. But building permits continued to fall, an indication that housing conditions haven't yet hit bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported yesterday that construction starts of new homes and apartments rose 9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.525 million units. That was a significant bounce-back from January, when construction starts plunged 14.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, which are followed to track future activity, declined 2.5% in February to an annual rate of 1.532 million. Authorizations were down 28.6% year to year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report suggests that "construction activity is likely to remain weak in the coming months," said Omair Sharif, strategist at <span class="companylink">RBS Greenwich Capital</span><span class="companylink">Greenwich Capital Markets.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector took a big bite out of economic growth in 2006 as home sales and construction retreated after a long run. Lehman Brothers economist Drew Matus, weighing the starts data, said it "supports the idea that the decline in starts will abate over time and housing will become less of a drag on growth going forward."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector is a component of gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic output. GDP began slowing last year after a long campaign of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve, which were designed to keep inflation in check. The Fed, which wraps up a two-day meeting on monetary policy today, is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged, with the federal funds rate holding steady at 5.25% for a sixth straight meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, home builders are worried that an already weak housing market could grow even weaker in light of problems in the subprime mortgage market. The National Association of Home Builders' index measuring how builders view future sales, which was released on Monday, fell to 36 during March from 39, the first drop in six months. Loan delinquencies and foreclosures are going up. Bad debts winding through a long foreclosure process could put upward pressure on inventories. And tighter lending standards might hurt home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With subprime mortgages making up 20% of the 2006 mortgage market, there is likely to be some fallout on housing demand from the woes of subprime lenders," said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, housing starts fell 29.7% in the Northeast and 14.4% in the Midwest but climbed 18% in the South and 26.4% in the West.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing News</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Had Better</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be Better Today</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There should be good news on the housing front today. Or at least there had better be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires estimate this morning's Commerce Department report on housing activity will show the pace of new-home construction starts hit an annualized rate of 1.45 million last month, up modestly from January's 1.41 million. The biggest reason the economists are looking for a rise? January housing starts -- hurt by the arrival of winter weather -- were 14.3% below December's, and there's just gotta be a rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may not sound like the sort of fancy analysis economists are supposed to be getting paid for, but when it comes to something like housing starts, which can swing from month to month, it's probably the best analysis available. About three-quarters of the 49 times housing starts have fallen more than 10% in the past 48 years, the next month they've been up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But persistent cold weather may have taken away any bounce, UBS economist Jim O'Sullivan says. Housing starts are adjusted to smooth out seasonal swings -- there are far more construction crews on the job in the summer than in the winter. But variations in the weather can make a hash of such adjustments. Warm weather in much of the U.S. had far more construction crews on the job in December than usual; when it got colder in January, construction activity fell sharply. But February was when the real cold weather, and the bigger winter storms, came, Mr. O'Sullivan notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But amid all the recent worries about mortgages for risky "subprime" borrowers, investors will have little patience for a weather story. If starts didn't rebound last month, they may conclude that housing -- already in sorry enough shape -- has taken a turn for the worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oracle Profits May Foretell</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health of Business Spending</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors should peer into Oracle's earnings report today to gauge the health of business spending -- a vital cog in the economy that could gain greater weight if the housing-market upheaval deals a blow to consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since hitting a five-year high in November, Oracle shares have dropped 13%, in part because of lackluster fiscal second-quarter earnings results. If sales get back on track, Oracle could make up much of that lost ground. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial expect the company to post fiscal third-quarter earnings, excluding one-time items, of 23 cents a share, up 64% from last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any sign of trouble, and Oracle shares could see more downside. More tellingly, weak results could also add to concerns about business spending, since pricey technology outlays are often the first casualties of a slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fear is that as earnings growth wanes, businesses will cut spending on new gear and hire fewer workers, sparking jitters about a recession. Some worrying signs have appeared. A factor in the Feb. 27 market tumble was a report showing durable-goods orders -- a barometer of business spending -- plunged nearly 9% in January. Labor costs have jumped, and worker productivity is sputtering, pressuring businesses to reduce costs. In 2003, a pickup in Oracle sales helped signal the economy was gaining traction. Now, the reverse may occur.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Analysts See</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing Starts Rising</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of home building may show a slight gain for February, but few analysts are forecasting any substantial headway against the downtrend. The consensus forecast sees housing starts rising 3% to an annual rate of about 1.45 million, but analysts aren't of one voice. They are more in agreement that building permits will show a further decline, to an annual rate of about 1.55 million-1.56 million. Commerce Department figures at 8:30 a.m. EDT.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A World Trade Organization panel will begin a hearing on U.S. objections to European support for Airbus. Washington claims European Union support for Airbus constitutes illegal aid and distorts market prices.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rapid unraveling of the subprime-mortgage industry is stirring new concerns about the already weak housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report released yesterday by Credit Suisse analyst Ivy Zelman forecast that credit tightening for financially stretched borrowers will lead to a 20% drop in new-home sales in 2007, to about 890,000, as buyers find it more difficult to borrow for homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coupled with a general waning in demand for housing and the exodus of speculators from the market, Ms. Zelman expects that credit tightening will cause housing starts to drop 35% to 45% through this year and into 2008 from their peak annual rate of 1.8 million units in January 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While subprime loans -- or loans to people with weak credit -- are often concentrated among entry-level buyers, Ms. Zelman says credit tightening "will affect the entire housing food chain."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If people selling an entry-level home can't find buyers, it often means they can't move up and buy a pricier home. Ms. Zelman, who derives much of her research from surveys with private builders and mortgage originators, also expects rising delinquencies among stretched borrowers to create a flood of foreclosures in the coming months that could add as much as 20% additional supply to the existing inventory.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sacramento's Drive to Sizzle Hits a Few Snags</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some splashy Sacramento projects have hit snags in their efforts to add more sizzle to the California capital's modest skyline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Progress has stalled on two luxury high-rise condominium projects -- including a 40-story tower known as the Aura and the Towers on Capitol Mall, slated to contain two 54-story towers. Both are key elements in the city's effort to transform itself into a more vibrant, 24-hour city. Meanwhile, in November Sacramento County voters rejected a tax increase that would have helped finance a new arena for the Sacramento Kings NBA team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenges have come as Sacramento's previously hot residential market, which had fueled the region's recent growth spurt, also has hit the brakes. After six years of double-digit annual price gains, the median price of existing single-family homes in Sacramento County and the city of West Sacramento fell about 1% to $368,283 last year from 2005, according to the Sacramento Association of Realtors. Median condominium prices fell 11% to $218,082 in January from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boosters say the difficulties are short-term setbacks. They believe the high-rise projects ultimately will get built, though other proposed luxury condominium proposals may wait until the larger projects move ahead. "Our market is ready for this kind of product -- but in baby steps," Garrick Brown, research director with Colliers International in Sacramento, says in an email. Downtown Sacramento has begun to change from an area that largely emptied out when workers went home to a cultural destination that has seen the opening of more than 40 new restaurants since 2005, according to a recent Colliers report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 90 miles northeast of San Francisco, Sacramento anchors a region of some 2.1 million people. Lower housing prices and living costs that are only 12% above the national average, compared with 40% above average for the San Francisco region, have drawn Bay Area residents in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some say the cooling housing market's impact on the high-rise projects has been overstated. Lenders leery of financing projects in smaller cities like Sacramento -- not lack of demand for luxury downtown living -- have delayed the start of construction on Denver-based BCN Development's Aura tower, according to BCN President Craig Nassi. Mr. Nassi says he has sold about 70% of the 268 units in the tower, designed by architect Daniel Libeskind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, construction halted on a second luxury high-rise project, proposed to include two 54-story towers, partly because of higher-than-expected building costs, according to the developer, John Saca, president of Saca Development. A spokeswoman for the California Public Employees' Retirement System says the pension fund has invested $25 million in the project, but won't put in any additional money. Mr. Saca is negotiating with Calpers to buy Calpers's interest in the project. At the same time, Calpers says it is moving forward to develop a five-block area that is to include loft-style housing adjacent to Calpers's Sacramento headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial real-estate market hasn't experienced the same severe downturn that has hit the residential market and the overall economy has remained stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downshift in the construction-sector jobs stemming from the lackluster housing market has been offset in part by a rise in government jobs as California's economy has improved and boosted state government, one of the area's major employers, according to Moody's Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One massive mixed-use plan took a step forward last year. Thomas Enterprises, a Georgia-based developer, paid an undisclosed price in December for a 240-acre former rail yard and former brownfield site. Located on the edge of downtown Sacramento, the project is planned to contain about 10,000 housing units as well as offices, hotels and retail when completed in about 20 years, says Suheil J. Totah, vice president of development for Thomas.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>400 words</div><div>7 March 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes listed for sale in 18 major metropolitan areas at the end of February was up 3.9% from a month earlier, according to data compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a national real-estate brokerage firm based in Emeryville, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors reported that its index of pending home sales in January fell 4.1% to 108.7 from an upwardly revised 113.3 in December. The index in January was down 8.9% from a year earlier. The index is based on agreements to buy houses, rather than completed transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply increase reported by ZipRealty is roughly in line with the typical rise in February as sellers begin to put houses on the market ahead of the spring home-shopping season. Inventories remain high in much of the country. In February, they were up 36% from a year earlier in the 15 metro areas for which comparable data were available, ZipRealty reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ZipRealty data cover listings of single-family homes, condominiums and town houses on local multiple-listing services. That excludes most newly built homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists are watching home inventories closely for signs of how long the current housing slump will last. Prices have been leveling off or falling modestly in much of the country since late 2005, after several years of unusual double-digit annual increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest increases in February from a month earlier were in the Los Angeles metro area, up 8.1%; Minneapolis, 6.6%; Las Vegas, 6.2%, and Miami, 5.8%, according to ZipRealty. (Compare inventory rates with an interactive chart on WSJ.com.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Lawler, a housing economist in Vienna, Va., says that the inventory trends are worrisome in already glutted markets, such as southern Florida, and that recent tightening of credit standards by subprime lenders will hurt sales this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of listed homes edged down 0.9% in the Washington, D.C., area and 0.5% in the Baltimore area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Borges LLosa, owner of FranklyRealty.com, a real-estate brokerage firm based in Arlington, Va., says the Washington area market has shown signs of improvement lately. "The buyers are out there, but they're still careful about not overpaying," he says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Mark Whitehouse and Timothy Aeppel </div><div>841 words</div><div>2 March 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. manufacturing sector showed signs of recovering from a recent slump, striking a positive note that boosted stocks and eased concerns the nation's economy could be headed for recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group for corporate purchasing managers, reported yesterday that its index of manufacturing activity rose to 52.3 in February from 49.3 the previous month. The index for new orders, an indicator of future activity, rose to 54.9 from 50.3. Any reading above 50 suggests the sector is expanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-related manufacturers, such as furniture makers, remained among the sector's most sluggish segments, while producers of petroleum, coal, plastics and rubber led the rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM survey caught some economists and investors by surprise, because other recent indicators had shown manufacturing faltering. Tuesday, for example, the Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods plunged 7.8% in January. That report helped trigger Tuesday's stock-market selloff, which ended with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 416.02 points, its seventh-largest point decline ever. The next day, the department reported that economic activity in the fourth quarter was weaker than previously thought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the ISM report, which covers the month of February and provides a more current look at business conditions, signaled that industrial activity is regaining momentum. "This gives some hope that manufacturers are working off excess stocks and should be poised to start growing again," said Daniel Meckstroth, chief economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a policy and research group in Arlington, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the report indicates that the weakness in the fourth quarter and in January "is not an indication that the manufacturing sector is entering a recession" that could drag down the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday's manufacturing news had an immediate effect on investors, helping the Dow Jones Industrial Average erase much of its 209-point drop earlier in the day. The Dow industrials closed at 12234.34, down 34.29 points, or 0.3%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to yesterday's assessment, the Commerce Department reported that consumer spending rose 0.5% in January from the previous month, down from December's 0.7% growth rate but still a healthy pace. The January spending growth was fueled, in part, by a 1.0% rise in personal income, which reflected rising wages, but also the nonrecurring effect of bonuses and executives cashing in on stock options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, manufacturers face head winds. They still have plenty of unsold inventory, and the latest data show businesses cutting back on investments in big-ticket capital goods -- all of which could slow production. Still, yesterday's reports offered reason for optimism, economists said. The data suggest consumer spending, which makes up two-thirds of the economy, is on track to grow at an annualized, inflation-adjusted rate of well more than 3% this quarter. That could help manufacturing turn around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumption entered the first quarter on a pretty strong note," said Mike Englund, chief economist at Action Economics, a consultancy in Boulder, Colo. "As long as the consumer remains healthy, production has to catch up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roger Douglas, president of Douglas Manufacturing Corp., Crete, Neb., a maker of products like voting booths and metal storage boxes, said it "seemed like everyone was on a long holiday vacation" at the end of last year and the first month of 2007. "But everything seems to be waking up right now -- inquiries, orders, everything seems to be taking a sudden upturn."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everything in yesterday's reports was positive. Americans are still spending beyond their immediate means: In January, their spending exceeded their disposable income by $116.4 billion, or 1.2%. As falling housing prices make consumers feel poorer, they may yet decide to cut back and save more. Though the latest data from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight showed house prices up 1.1% in the fourth quarter from the third, most economists believe prices have a way to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The personal-income report also contained a whiff of inflation. The Fed's preferred gauge of inflation -- the price index for personal consumption, excluding food and energy -- rose 0.3% in January after rising only 0.1% in December, and was up 2.3% from the year earlier. That is above the Fed's comfort range of 1% to 2%. Meanwhile, the housing slump keeps weighing on construction activity, which fell 0.8% in January from the previous month, the Commerce Department said. Construction of houses and other residential properties fell 1.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, manufacturers in sectors tied to housing and autos have been among the hardest hit. But Norbert Ore, a procurement executive at Georgia-Pacific LLC, who oversees the manufacturing report, said signs of life in some sectors, such as wood products and textiles, suggest the worst may have passed. </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">U.S. revises growth down to 2.2% --- GDP estimate is cut for fourth quarter; new-home sales sink   </span>
</div><div class="author">By Jeff Bater   </div><div>517 words</div><div>1 March 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. economy grew only modestly in the final months of 2006, the government said, lowering its original estimate because of a smaller-than-expected rise in business inventories.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross domestic product rose at a 2.2% annual rate in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said yesterday. Originally, growth for the period was estimated at 3.5%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate Commerce report yesterday showed new-home sales plunged in January to the lowest level in nearly four years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new estimate of a 2.2% seasonally adjusted rise in GDP meant America's economy was just a little stronger than in the third quarter, when the growth rate was 2%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"After almost three years of above-average GDP growth, the economy has entered a new phase of below-average growth," said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics. "This is no random event or accident; it is the direct consequence of the 4.25 percentage points of Fed-led increases in short-term interest rates."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the past two years, the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised its federal-funds rate target to 5.25% from 1% to prevent the economy from overheating and inflation from getting out of control.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price gauges within the GDP report suggested inflation is backing down. The price index for personal consumption excluding food and energy rose at a 1.9% annual rate in the fourth quarter. That was below a previously estimated 2.1% increase and lower than the third quarter's 2.2% climb, and also within the Fed's comfort zone of 1% to 2%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While the top-line growth numbers are a little weaker than is consistent with the Fed's forecast, Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues can take comfort in the fact that inflation is easing," said Global Insight Chief Economist Nariman Behravesh, referring to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big factor in the downward revision of fourth-quarter growth was businesses making less investment in inventories than previously thought. The GDP data showed businesses increased inventories by $17.3 billion; originally Commerce had estimated an increase of $35.3 billion.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses had kept accumulating inventories even though the economy was slowing. In the fourth quarter, companies lowered inventory growth in a belated response to receding demand.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trade didn't give the fourth-quarter economy as big a boost as originally reported. U.S. exports rose 10.5%, while imports fell 2.2%.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big drag on U.S. economic growth was the housing sector. Residential fixed investment, which includes spending on housing, plunged 19.1% in the fourth quarter.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things weren't much better for the sector in the new year. New-home sales fell 16.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 937,000 in January, the weakest sales rate since 936,000 in February 2003.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price fell to $239,800 from $244,900 a year earlier.   </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Drag From Housing Could Persist --- Steep Sales Drop Suggests Effect on Economic Growth May Continue for Months</span>
</div><div class="author">By Christopher Conkey and Mary Ellen Lloyd </div><div>501 words</div><div>1 March 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- New-home sales plummeted in January, an indication that turbulence in the housing market will continue weighing on the nation's economic growth and housing-related businesses in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes plunged 16.6% to an annual pace of 937,000 units, the Commerce Department said. That rate was 20% below a year earlier, and the median sales price of $239,800 was down 2.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly readings are volatile and prone to weather-related distortions, but the January decline adds to the uncertainty as to whether demand for housing is stabilizing. Home builders have been lowering prices or beefing up incentives in an effort to jump-start sales, but cancellation rates remain high. That has forced many builders to slash production, which has limited economic growth and damped earnings for building-material and home-furnishing suppliers. Home Depot Inc. warned yesterday that 2007 earnings will drop a sharper-than-expected 4% to 9% as it spends $2.2 billion on renovating its retail operations and grapples with a challenging business environment. The outlook is more cautious than that of smaller rival Lowe's Cos., which last week projected same-store sales would be flat to up 2% in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lowe's forecast was based on the view that sales of new and existing homes will flatten as 2007 wears on. "I hope they're right about the market," Home Depot Chief Executive Frank Blake said. "I tend to the more cautious side on that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Longer term, the Atlanta home-improvement chain said its per-share earnings should increase 10% or more annually as the investments in its core business boost productivity. That view assumes the housing and residential construction markets improve late in the second half of 2007 or early 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While the current home-improvement market remains challenging, the long-term fundamentals of our company are strong, and we believe we can improve our performance and grow at, or faster than, the market beyond 2007," Mr. Blake said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the threat of further deterioration in the housing market is the biggest risk to economic growth this year. A recent rise in default rates for subprime mortgages has raised the prospect of a broader credit crunch, and the biggest fear is consumers will curtail their spending if the housing slump becomes prolonged. (See related articles on auto sales and the mortgage market on pages A6 and D1.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, a housing market at or near its bottom would pave the way for a resumption of home building this year. In January, though, the slower sales pace raised the inventory. The inventory of unsold new homes on the market rose to the equivalent of a 6.8-month supply, up from a 5.7-month supply in December. </p>
