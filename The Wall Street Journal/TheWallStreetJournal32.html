<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A co-op studio apartment for sale in Olinville in the Bronx is priced at $59,900. An article on the Property page on Thursday about low-end homes incorrectly said it was priced at $59,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ August 20, 2010)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cheapest property on the market in New York City right now is a 300-square-foot studio co-op in a six-story brick building in the Bronx's Fordham Manor. The kitchen needs an update, but Midtown is only a 45-minute subway ride away. The cost: $45,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey compiled by PropertyShark.com for The Wall Street Journal reveals a snapshot of the extreme low end of the housing market in the five boroughs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Properties with rock-bottom prices include a one-bedroomco-op in St. Albans, Queens, priced at $59,000; a 350-square-foot studio in St. George, Staten Island -- a short walk from the ferry terminal -- priced at $82,500; and a one-bedroom co-op near Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, a foreclosure that hit the market while undergoing a renovation, listed for $54,900. These bargain-basement listings show that purchase prices are much lower than their highs 1 1/2 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many, homeownership at this end of the market is far cheaper than renting: With a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage and a 4.5% interest rate, the one-bedroom co-op in Queens will cost about $300 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when it comes to apartments in a city where the median sales price is $370,000, "cheap" is a relative term. According to Jonathan Miller, president and chief executive of Miller Samuel, a real-estate appraisal firm, low-end sales prices in the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island currently hover around $250,000. In Brooklyn, that number is closer to $400,000. In Manhattan, cheap tops out at about $600,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City housing prices are off as much as 30% from their peaks in late 2006 to 2008 when the market was booming, said Mr. Miller. But unlike the high end of the market, low-end units -- which make up 37% of current listings -- saw less of a decline in prices, mainly because of a federal tax credit that was worth as much as $8,000 for first-time home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The entry-level market is usually the first to drop . . . and the first to come back," according to Mr. Miller. He said that "2009 saw a large share of entry-level or lower-priced sales. And in 2010, we saw the return of the high-end properties, resulting in a more normal mix of activity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, properties at this end of the market move faster than they did during the financial crisis, but they're not flying off the shelves, said Mr. Miller. Obtaining financing remains an obstacle for potential buyers. Even at bargain-basement prices, some properties can spend months or even years on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A mobile home on leased land in Mariners Harbor, Staten Island, is priced to move at $59,900. "It's not the greatest," said Jo Ann Bodenschatz, who took ownership of the home after her mother passed away in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home has '80s wood paneling throughout, brown linoleum floors in the kitchen, and walls crying out for a new coat of paint. Ms. Bodenschatz described interest in the home, on the market since February, as "slow."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or there's the co-op studio in Olinville in the Bronx that has been listed since October 2009 and is priced at $59,000. "I've had bad luck" in trying to find a buyer for the unit, said broker Michael A. Brown, who has sold four other studios in the building recently. The remaining unit -- the cheapest of the group -- has a vintage bathroom accented with pink and black tiles and a kitchen with tiled floors and Formica countertops that were updated this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It needs modernizing," Mr. Brown said. But, he added, "there's no holes or leaks."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owning anything in Manhattan will cost at least six figures, and homes on the cheap may come with strings attached. One option is a one-bedroom co-op on West 119th Street in Harlem priced at $125,000. The home, which is located in a Housing Development Fund Corp. building, requires that the buyer have an income not exceeding $93,000. The apartment was listed in March at $130,000, but the price has since been dropped to attract cash offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller says that homes at the low end of the market are predominantly purchased by first-time home buyers or buyers trading up within the lower end of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a limited number of investment purchasers unless they're foreclosure properties," he said, adding that foreclosures tend to sell at 25% below market and attract savvy purchasers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you do take the plunge on the low-end, interior designer Betsy Head says to embrace it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have to surrender to a bad space," said Ms. Head, who purchased her own approximately 350-square-foot studio in Greenwich Village for just over $200,000 in 2005 and recently put it on the market for $350,000. "You can't really be a diva in a space like this. Or a pack rat, either."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. manufacturers increased their output in July as the auto sector continued to recover, pushing overall industrial production up 1%, but housing starts extended their weakness following the spring expiration of a government tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family housing starts fell to the lowest rate since May 2009, while overall starts, driven by multifamily construction, rose slightly after sharp declines since April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong gain in industrial production, following a small dip in June, suggested that underlying demand in the economy may be holding up despite worries about slowing growth in the second half. Most key sectors-- from aircraft to appliances to chemicals -- posted gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Output of vehicles and auto parts increased 9.9%, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday, amid fewer plant shutdowns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"After its brush with death last year, this segment of the economy is becoming a bright light in the recovery," said economist Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts said the gains in overall output may be temporary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surveys of businesses "have been reasonably consistent in saying that orders are flagging and that inventories have been building," <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group</span> economists said in a research note. "If that's the pattern, then gains in production will not last."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improvement came as manufacturers faced higher costs. Producer prices rose 0.2% in July from the prior month, while prices excluding volatile food and energy costs increased 0.3%, the Labor Department said. But weakness in prices for goods used earlier in the production process indicates that underlying inflation will remain low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The softness in housing starts, reflected in a report from the Commerce Department, is unlikely to abate in coming months. Housing activity surged as the April 30 expiration of a federal tax credit for home buyers prompted some people to buy sooner, creating a summer sales lull that is expected to stretch into fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, housing starts rebounded 1.7% to an annualized rate of 546,000 units after sharp declines in May and June. The gain came from a surge in starts for the volatile multifamily category, such as apartment buildings. Single-family starts fell 4.2%, the fourth straight monthly decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was little hope for builders on the horizon as overall housing permits, an indicator of future starts, fell 3.1% to a 14-month low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A high foreclosure rate and weak demand are likely to keep the market under pressure at least into next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Financial distress on the part of many households, ongoing labor-market weakness, and vicious competition from an enormous overhang of existing homes all point to a very tough slog for homebuilders in the months and quarters ahead," said Joshua Shapiro, chief economist at MFR Inc., a consultancy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. industrial production rebounded last month, a reassuring sign from a segment of the economy that has helped drive the recovery, while a producer-price rise should ease deflation concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, July housing starts increased, but a decline in building permits suggests future construction could be lackluster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production last month rose 1% from June, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday, following June's decline of 0.1%. The report was slightly better than expected. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires were forecasting a 0.7% rise in manufacturing output.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy started to expand again just over a year ago, with manufacturing a key area of support amid weakness in other segments, particularly housing. But the recovery has recently been losing momentum, prompting the Federal Reserve to resume buying government debt in an attempt to kick-start growth. Some Fed officials worry the U.S. could experience a Japan-like period of low growth and falling prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report Tuesday showed U.S. producer prices rose for the first time in four months in July as the price of cars and light trucks increased, easing concerns that the economy could become so weak that it leads to deflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed report showed most sectors registered output gains in July. Production of motor vehicles and parts jumped 9.9% after a 2.5% decline in June. Excluding autos, production in other parts of the economy expanded 0.6% in July following a flat performance the month before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Output in the mining industry rose by 0.9% on the back of higher crude-oil production, while defense and space equipment gained 1.1%, largely because of a rebound in cargo-plane production following the end of a strike in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing report, meanwhile, was mixed. While the market is unlikely to return to the depressed levels seen roughly a year ago, July's 1.7% rise from a month earlier to 546,000 still leaves the level well below April's 679,000. Home sales have been coming down following the April 30 expiration of the government tax credit for first-time purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The July rise comes after a 13.4% decline in May and an 8.7% drop in June. However, it was almost entirely the result of a large increase in groundbreaking activity in the volatile multifamily sector, while single-family starts declined by 4% to 432,000 units. Building in coming months will likely be sluggish, as the latest data showed July permits fell 3.1% to an annual rate of 565,000. Building permits are a sign of future construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expected overall housing starts to increase to 550,000. Building permits were seen rising by 2.1% in July to a rate of 586,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration's tax credit had helped housing up until April, but the sector is hurting again following the end of the stimulus. The positive manufacturing report, one of the few sectors of the economy that has constantly added jobs in recent months, provides some relief that the U.S. will avoid a double-dip recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Federal Reserve officials are concerned that weak consumer demand, a key growth engine for the economy, could put downward pressure on prices and lead to deflation. Deflation can become a dangerous spiral in which consumers are encouraged to save more on expectations they can buy goods and services later at a lower price, thus hurting the economy further. Central-bank officials may find some comfort from the producer-price report out Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index of producer prices, which measures how much manufacturers and wholesalers pay for goods and materials, rose 0.2% in July from June, a Labor Department report showed. It was the first increase since March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stripping out more volatile food and energy prices, the government report showed that wholesale inflation rose 0.3%, its largest increase since a 0.3% rise in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires were expecting producer prices to rise 0.2% last month. Underlying producer prices were expected to be up 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the 12 months ended in July, the producer-price index rose 4.2%, accelerating from a 2.8% increase in June. It was the ninth straight year-on-year increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of raw materials, known as crude goods, rose 2.7% after a 2.4% drop in June. Almost two-thirds of the July increase was a result of the index for crude energy materials, which moved up 4.5%. Natural-gas prices rose 1.7%.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All year long, the Obama administration has defended its decision to postpone the debate over the fate of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> by arguing that it first needed to put the housing market back on track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, as mortgage-industry executives and government officials prepare to meet for a summit on Tuesday to begin those discussions in earnest, policy makers are facing an unexpected problem: The housing market appears to be stalling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That will make officials more cautious in considering any dramatic overhaul, because a shaky outlook further underscores the market's heavy dependence on Fannie and Freddie, which together with the Federal Housing Administration are backstopping nine out of every 10 new loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It pulls the debate in the opposite direction," said Howard Glaser, an industry consultant. "If we're stuck in the midst of this semi-permanent housing crisis, the question of the federal role becomes almost intractable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year, housing prices across much of the country began to stabilize as the government spurred sales by providing federal tax credits for home buyers and by holding down mortgage rates. The removal of those supports has exposed lingering weakness, putting renewed pressure on prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While mortgage rates are still at record lows, home sales have plunged in the months following the expiration of home-buyer tax credits in April. In July, they dropped 27% in Denver, 42% in Minneapolis and 45% in Milwaukee from a year earlier, according to data from local real-estate brokers' groups. Meanwhile, efforts to modify mortgages, which have held potential foreclosures off the market, have fallen short of their goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Tuesday's sessions could help build broader support for the road map the White House has promised to deliver by early next year. They may also help shield the administration against accusations of foot-dragging as the two-year anniversary of the government takeover of Fannie and Freddie approaches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Panelists include capital markets veterans Lewis Ranieri, the co-inventor of the mortgage-backed security, and <span class="companylink">Pacific Investment Management Co</span>.'s Bill Gross; the heads of the mortgage banking divisions at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp;Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>.; and academics and economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, administration officials have said the previous ownership model for Fannie and Freddie should be discarded. For decades, a fuzzy "implied" guarantee allowed the companies, owned by private shareholders, to borrow cheaply because investors assumed that the government would rescue the firms at the first whiff of trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, a consensus of academics, industry officials and investors has coalesced around the idea of using the government to provide explicit guarantees for securities backed by mortgages that meet certain standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tough questions loom over how those guarantees would be structured and priced and what entities would provide them. One overarching goal is to restore the private sector to its historical role in taking credit risk for a larger share of the market. "We have to get back to some semblance of that world," an administration official said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some conservatives, including congressional Republicans, have come out against returning to any mortgage market that relies on government subsidies or guarantees. That could lead to higher costs, but they say it is the only way to prevent taxpayers from being on the hook again for massive losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the administration has promised to deliver "fundamental change," officials are likely to proceed slowly -- focusing as much attention on any transition as they do on the final destination -- to avoid rattling the $5 trillion bond market for government-backed mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers appear less likely to push for wholesale changes such as any move away from supporting long-term, fixed-rate loans or from a secondary market built upon securitization, where loans are packaged and then sold to investors as bonds.</p>

In June, the number of homeowners whose government loan modifications were canceled, because they didn't make their payments or couldn't provide qualifying documents, was double the number of borrowers who entered the program. If more homes that represent a "shadow supply" of delinquent loans and foreclosures hit the market, home prices could tumble further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's been a feeling in government, which seems to be more pervasive than it was six months ago, that says, 'We've solved this housing problem; let's move on to Fannie and Freddie,'" said Laurie Goodman, a senior managing director at mortgage-bond trader <span class="companylink">Amherst Securities Group LP</span> in New York. "But you haven't solved this housing problem. We have another round of home prices going down a little more."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Tuesday's sessions could help build broader support for the road map the White House has promised to deliver by early next year. They may also help shield the administration against accusations of foot-dragging as the two-year anniversary of the government takeover of Fannie and Freddie approaches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Panelists include capital markets veterans Lewis Ranieri, the co-inventor of the mortgage-backed security, and <span class="companylink">Pacific Investment Management Co</span>.'s Bill Gross; the heads of the mortgage banking divisions at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>.; and academics and economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, administration officials have said the previous ownership model for Fannie and Freddie should be discarded. For decades, a fuzzy "implied" guarantee allowed the companies, owned by private shareholders, to borrow cheaply because investors assumed that the government would rescue the firms at the first whiff of trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, a consensus of academics, industry officials and investors has coalesced around the idea of using the government to provide explicit guarantees for securities backed by mortgages that meet certain standards. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has said there is a strong case for "some type" of government guarantee that allows people to finance a home purchase even during a severe recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tough questions loom over how those guarantees would be structured and priced and what entities would provide them. One overarching goal is to restore the private sector to its historical role in taking credit risk for a larger share of the market. "We have to get back to some semblance of that world," an administration official said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some conservatives, including congressional Republicans, have come out against returning to any mortgage market that relies on government subsidies or guarantees. That could lead to higher costs, but they say it is the only way to prevent taxpayers from being on the hook again for massive losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the administration has promised to deliver "fundamental change," officials are likely to proceed slowly—focusing as much attention on any transition as they do on the final destination—to avoid rattling the $5 trillion bond market for government-backed mortgages. "People who have big reform ideas and objectives and no way to get there, that's not realistic," the administration official said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers appear less likely to push for wholesale changes such as any move away from supporting long-term, fixed-rate loans or from a secondary market built upon securitization, where loans are packaged and then sold to investors as bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government took over Fannie and Freddie in September 2008 through a legal process known as conservatorship and has since pledged to inject unlimited amounts of taxpayer money to keep the firms afloat. So far, it has committed $148 billion. That tab could grow if prices fall further.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Craig Karmin </div><div>759 words</div><div>12 August 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A21</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decades-old federal law initially intended to reduce fraud in sales of Florida swampland was applied for the first time to help dissatisfied buyers of Manhattan condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A federal judge in Manhattan ruled on Tuesday that a company controlled by property developer Africa Israel, a unit of Israeli-based AFI Group, had to return deposits to three buyers of condos in a downtown apartment building because of inadequate disclosure in the condo's offering plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The judge referred to the obscure federal law known as the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act, or ILSA, as the basis for allowing the three buyers of units at 111 Fulton St. to get out of their contracts and receive refunds on their deposits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials at Africa Israel didn't respond to calls seeking comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judges in other states have cited ILSA when ruling on behalf of home buyers but lawyers say this decision marks the first time in New York that a developer hasn't prevailed in an ILSA case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ruling comes at a time when hundreds of New York condo buyers have been trying to escape contracts signed around the market's peak and whose units have since fallen significantly in value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawyers have pored through piles of documents and arcane laws in an effort to find something that would enable buyers to invalidate their contracts. Starting in early 2009, many buyers have based their cases around interpretations of ILSA. Some attorneys suggest that Tuesday's ruling could make way for pending cases and new appeals based on the act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's quite significant," says James Schwartz, partner at Mitchell Silberberg &amp;Knupp, a New York law firm not involved in the case. "It opens the door for wholesale use of the act to get out of contracts."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. District Court Judge George B. Daniels ruled that the developer failed to comply with ILSA, which requires that buildings with more than 100 units provide buyers with documents that include a long list of disclosure details, from information about the condo association to zoning regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the developer fails to meet the disclosure requirements, buyers under the act have the right to tear up their contracts and receive refunds on their deposits within two years of their contract signings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In previous New York cases, developers have argued successfully in court for exemptions from ILSA, such as saying that even though their buildings were marketed as having more than 100 units, fewer than 100 were actually sold. The law was initially intended to protect consumers from fraud on sales of Florida swampland and Arizona desert land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce H. Lederman, an attorney with D'Agostino, Levine, Landesman &amp;Lederman who has represented developers in other ILSA cases, says that Tuesday's ruling wouldn't have a far-reaching effect. "The judge decided that the very specific language of that condo offering plan did not qualify for exemption," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Lawrence Weiner, a <span class="companylink">Wilentz, Goldman &amp;Spitzer</span> attorney who represented the buyers in the case, said developers had sometimes said that ILSA does not apply to high-rise condominiums. "This case reconfirms that it does apply," says Mr. Weiner. He added he has about nine pending ILSA cases related to New York buildings, involving more than 50 purchasers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is also appealing two other ILSA-related cases, one in Harlem and one in Long Island City, where the court ruled on behalf of the developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent federal court rulings in Virginia and Florida that sided with buyers in ILSA cases had given hope to New York lawyers working with condo owners that their state would follow the same logic. "Even though it's a different jurisdiction, the ruling was persuasive and supports the purchaser," Mr. Weiner said of the Virginia case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 163-unit Fulton Street building began selling condos in June 2007, and three condo owners in the case signed contracts in 2007 and 2008. Their combined deposits totaled about $300,000, and the purchase price of their apartments ranged between $800,000 and $1.485 million, court documents said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Africa Israel is headed by Lev Leviev, an Uzbekistan-born diamond merchant who immigrated to Israel and in recent years has bought up trophy properties in Brooklyn and Manhattan. That includes the historic Apthorp on the Upper West Side which is being converted into a high-end condo from a rental.</p>

</div><div class="author">By A.D. Pruitt </div><div>717 words</div><div>11 August 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 22,400-square-foot parking lot in the heart of Philadelphia's central business district was supposed to be the new home of a 58-story luxury hotel and condominium tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the lot at 1441 Chestnut St. is scheduled to be sold to the highest bidder in a public auction this October. Purchased for about $12 million in 2000, the site likely will sell for less than that given how weak the market is for new development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site, which sits next to a Ritz-Carlton Hotel and Residences and can accommodate a structure of more than 800,000 square feet, will be offered "absolute, regardless of price," said Doug Johnson, a managing director of CB Richard Ellis Auction Services, which is handling the auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Observers said it likely will remain as a parking lot until the market for office space, condominiums or hotel rooms improves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Johnson said one of the best things the site has going for it is the parking lot, which generates more than $600,000 in revenue a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The buyer of this property will be able to offset their cost of carry until they develop the property," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An office building would be tricky. The last new office building completed in the city was the headquarters for <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp</span>. That project moved forward only because it had nailed such a tony tenant. Hether Smith, senior vice president and branch manager for Studley Inc. in Philadelphia who represents tenants, said the landlord would have to prelease at least 600,000 square feet to a credit-worthy tenant. She said this could be difficult given the small universe of potential tenants that would be interested in that size range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, vacancy trends don't look promising. The Philadelphia office market in the second quarter saw vacancies of 13.9% compared with 11.1% in the second quarter of 2007, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The residential and hotel markets, meantime, remain sluggish. Hotel occupancy in Philadelphia was 63.3% in the first half, up 5.9% from the same period last year, but still slow. Revenue per available room was $68.60 in the first half, up 1.6% from the year-ago period, according to <span class="companylink">Smith Travel Research</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin Gillen, vice president of Econsult Corp., an economic-consulting firm in Philadelphia, said that while condominium sales have started to pick up and inventories are coming down slowly, it still is a buyer's market. He said condominium inventory, with roughly 1,700 units up for sale, is double the historical average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the monthly average of the percentage of condos sold is 10%, up from 2% last year but down from the 15% during the boom years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The likelihood of a new residential tower being put up in Philadelphia right now is relatively low. The last iteration of residential condo towers in Philadelphia were planned at or before the height of the market that were all delivered after the market had already turned," said Jerome Kranzel, senior vice president of investment sales for <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. He said there still is a significant inventory of new luxury condos nearby at the 10 Rittenhouse and Murano towers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kranzel said it would cost between $500 and $700 a foot to put up a new condo building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim Mahoney, president and chief executive of Mariner Commercial Properties, purchased 1441 Chestnut in 2000 for about $12 million. At the time, it was a two-story office building that housed a Dalton Book Store. Mariner joined with Brook Lenfest, who runs venture-capital firm Brooks Capital Group, to build a $420 million Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. The first 24 stories would be hospitality and the rest luxury condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were about to open up a new sales center in February [2009] when we just said you know what . . . the timing is wrong. The market is not going to get better," Mr. Mahoney said. He said it would have been difficult to obtain financing for the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mahoney said he has since sold his interest in the site to Mr. Lenfest. A representative for Mr. Lenfest couldn't be reached to comment.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Juliet Chung </div><div>1064 words</div><div>11 August 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in the up-and-down world of real estate, this pitch may sound a little funny: "Affordable housing for the affluent."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the strategy developers of high-end vacation homes are devising as home sales slump in major markets across the country and inventories of unsold homes rise. They are building smaller, less expensive houses in resort communities. As a result, from Turks and Caicos in the West Indies to the Colorado Rockies, some vacation communities are getting just a bit less exclusive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal is to avoid lowering the sales prices on existing homes and upsetting homeowners who paid more for their homes. The communities typically cater to people seeking a second, or third, or even fourth home as well as amenities like a clubhouse, beach access, or golf courses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're trying to get the point across that you can have a great place in a wonderful island for, quite frankly, a reasonable price," says Steve Schram, who is developing a Turks and Caicos resort community which has a new push labeled "affordable housing for the affluent."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a private, 1,100-acre island, Turks &amp;Caicos Sporting Club at Ambergris Cay offers members access to white sand beaches, sports fishing, scuba diving and a jet strip. This year, Mr. Schram, chairman at DPS Sporting Club Development Co., and a partner rolled out an option to build a small house, designed by architects they'd hired, that could limit a buyer's purchase of house and land to as low as $1.4 million. That's 44% less than the $2.5 million required for the island's least expensive property and home previously. And it's a big comedown from 2007, when a buyer paid about $6.5 million for an undeveloped eight-acre lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In central Florida, at Pine Creek Sporting Club, a hunting retreat where members shoot quail and deer and ammunition is included in homeowners' dues, new buyers can purchase cabins, starting at 1,500 square feet and $600,000. Previously, the least expensive option was to pay about $2 million and up for a 40-plus acre ranch site and custom home. Developer Stephen Myers Jr., who converted a ranch site into 23 cabin sites in September, says he is considering converting another ranch site into cabins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private wealth manager Kim Fonseca, of North Palm Beach, Fla., purchased one of the new cabins, paying less than $700,000 for a three-bedroom cabin. His wife Nicole furnished it in a hunting motif. The house has wood beams, slate tile floors and a big moose head over the fireplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the cabin was completed in March, the Fonsecas have spent nearly every weekend there with their family or friends, and their dogs. Recently, the club's chef cooked a turkey his son had shot for their dinner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a smaller house, "I can lock it and leave" instead of keeping a staff on-site, says Mr. Fonseca, 55.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some ways, the luxury resorts are acting more like typical planned communities. Some developers are making sample floor plans for the first time instead of having buyers design their own homes -- often a more expensive proposition. Others are decreasing lot sizes. Developers say they're also responding to what post-boom buyers want: value and convenience, rather than supersized lots and homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Marabou, a 1,700-acre ranch community near Steamboat Springs, Colo., where amenities include fly-fishing and cattle-driving, new buyers are offered incentives to purchase undeveloped lots that start at about $1.8 million, a 20% price cut. The developer is offering to pay down points on some mortgages to lower buyers' interest rates. In other cases, the developer is offering to pay a portion of homeowner dues, which run $24,000 annually. And for the first time since the development broke ground in 2006, prices on a few properties have dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think our owners understand the market is tough right now," says developer Jeff Temple, who said 2009 was Marabou's worst year of sales, but that sales had picked up since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Bend, Ore., golf-club community Pronghorn has designed a series of homes starting at $700,000. That's 50% less than the minimum required to buy a lot and build a custom home, the next cheapest form of ownership there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The whole world doesn't live in second homes that are over $2 million," says Terry Russell, president of the development and management group at Atlanta-based Reynolds Co., which owns and manages more than a dozen developments around the Southeast. It is also adding lower-priced homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Gatti bought into a golf development in the Blue Ridge Mountains near Blowing Rock, N.C., in 2006. He estimates he and his wife spent about $2 million to buy two acres and build a five-bedroom custom vacation home with what he describes as "endless" views of the mountain ranges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reynolds bought the 6,300-acre development in December 2008 as it was going through foreclosure, renaming it Reynolds Blue Ridge and creating a system of trails leading to swimming holes. Tennis courts, a gym and other amenities are in the works. This summer, the company began building cottages a few miles from Mr. Gatti's home that are on the market for less than $600,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To some extent, anything that keeps the development moving forward, we're all for it," says Mr. Gatti, 50, who owns a tax preparation company. "We're at a different place than we were three or four years ago."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 22,400-square-foot parking lot in the heart of Philadelphia's central business district was supposed to be the new home of a 58-story luxury hotel and condominium tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the lot at 1441 Chestnut St. is scheduled to be sold to the highest bidder in a public auction this October. Purchased for about $12 million in 2000, the site likely will sell for less than that given how weak the market is for new development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site, which sits next to a Ritz-Carlton Hotel and Residences and can accommodate a structure of more than 800,000 square feet, will be offered "absolute, regardless of price," said Doug Johnson, a managing director of CB Richard Ellis Auction Services, which is handling the auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Observers said it likely will remain as a parking lot until the market for office space, condominiums or hotel rooms improves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Johnson said one of the best things the site has going for it is the parking lot, which generates more than $600,000 in revenue a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The buyer of this property will be able to offset their cost of carry until they develop the property," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An office building would be tricky. The last new office building completed in the city was the headquarters for <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp</span>. That project moved forward only because it had nailed such a tony tenant. Hether Smith, senior vice president and branch manager for Studley Inc. in Philadelphia who represents tenants, said the landlord would have to prelease at least 600,000 square feet to a credit-worthy tenant. She said this could be difficult given the small universe of potential tenants that would be interested in that size range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, vacancy trends don't look promising. The Philadelphia office market in the second quarter saw vacancies of 13.9% compared with 11.1% in the second quarter of 2007, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The residential and hotel markets, meantime, remain sluggish. Hotel occupancy in Philadelphia was 63.3% in the first half, up 5.9% from the same period last year, but still slow. Revenue per available room was $68.60 in the first half, up 1.6% from the year-ago period, according to <span class="companylink">Smith Travel Research</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin Gillen, vice president of Econsult Corp., an economic-consulting firm in Philadelphia, said that while condominium sales have started to pick up and inventories are coming down slowly, it still is a buyer's market. He said condominium inventory, with roughly 1,700 units up for sale, is double the historical average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the monthly average of the percentage of condos sold is 10%, up from 2% last year but down from the 15% during the boom years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The likelihood of a new residential tower being put up in Philadelphia right now is relatively low. The last iteration of residential condo towers in Philadelphia were planned at or before the height of the market that were all delivered after the market had already turned," said Jerome Kranzel, senior vice president of investment sales for <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. He said there still is a significant inventory of new luxury condos nearby at the 10 Rittenhouse and Murano towers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kranzel said it would cost between $500 and $700 a foot to put up a new condo building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim Mahoney, president and chief executive of Mariner Commercial Properties, purchased 1441 Chestnut in 2000 for about $12 million. At the time, it was a two-story office building that housed a Dalton Book Store. Mariner joined with Brook Lenfest, who runs venture-capital firm Brooks Capital Group, to build a $420 million Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. The first 24 stories would be hospitality and the rest luxury condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were about to open up a new sales center in February [2009] when we just said you know what … the timing is wrong. The market is not going to get better," Mr. Mahoney said. He said it would have been difficult to obtain financing for the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The capital markets had shut down, [and] the market was already showing incredible signs of weakness," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mahoney said he has since sold his interest in the site to Mr. Lenfest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A representative for Mr. Lenfest couldn't be reached to comment.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anita Likus </div><div>853 words</div><div>11 August 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>22</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON -- U.K. banks and other creditors are speeding up distressed sales of commercial-property assets partly because they are concerned the recent increase in prices may be leveling off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But buyers shouldn't expect cheap property to flood the market and reduce prices. While banks will accelerate property sales, they will continue to sell assets in an orderly manner to protect prices in a recovering market, observers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, there have been 64 deals that included a bank or receiver for a total of GBP 1.71 billion ($2.72 billion), compared with GBP 1.91 billion for the whole of 2009, according to data provider Property Data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent deal marks the first time that an issue of commercial mortgage-backed securities backed by British properties was placed in liquidation since the downturn. It involves a group of U.K. office properties, called the White Tower portfolio. Entrepreneur Simon Halabi borrowed some GBP 1.15 billion, mostly backed by the portfolio. His company defaulted on the loan after falling property values left it in violation of a covenant governing the ratio of the loan's size to the portfolio's value. Control of the properties went to receiver <span class="companylink">Ernst &amp;Young LLP</span>, which sold six of the nine assets to Carlyle Group LLC for GBP 671 million in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other deals include the GBP 215 million sale of the Cumberland Hotel in London to <span class="companylink">Starwood Capital Group</span> by the <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC</span>, and the sale of the office block Central Cross for GBP 146 million to property specialist <span class="companylink">Derwent London PLC</span> by property investment and development company Glebe Holdings Ltd., which was forced to sell by lender <span class="companylink">Lloyds Banking Group PLC</span>. Glebe bought the Central Cross office property in 2007 for GBP 223.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The assets coming on the market include distressed real estate taken over by lenders as well as troubled loans whose borrowers have defaulted. Most are being sold below book value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The scale of the deleveraging task facing the banks is huge. With their teams now in place, plus growing awareness over potential future occupier weakness, banks do have to move forward and start to make progress," said Bill Hughes, managing director at <span class="companylink">Legal &amp;General Property Ltd</span>. <span class="companylink">Legal &amp;General</span> has bought GBP 350 million of bank-related transactions since June 2009 from five different lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.K. banks lent generously to commercial-property owners and developers before the credit crunch. When property values started falling, many borrowers defaulted on payments and loans breached covenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to protect the market from further declines, banks have tried to avoid seizing collateral if the owner has been able to service debt. Banks have sold only a limited number of distressed assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some observers predict sales will accelerate partly because banks have completed the process of going through their troubled loans and decided which to keep and which to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, some banks are eager to lock in the recent rise in prices. Property values reached their trough in the summer of last year, after falling some 45% since the credit crunch in 2007. They have increased since then, but some are concerned that the increase in values is slowing down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While banks have been reducing their exposure to commercial real estate, they have a long way to go to clean up their balance sheets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is still a lot of debt that needs to be taken out of U.K. commercial property," said Bart Gysens, a <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> analyst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lloyds has been reducing its exposure to commercial-property loans, which fell to GBP 35 billion in the first half of this year compared with GBP 47 billion in 2008. The bank has identified new lending to commercial real estate as noncore, which means they won't be expanding this part of the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks can afford to take more write-downs because their balance sheets are looking better, analysts said. They also are concerned some of their collateral might look less attractive to investors in the future because tenant leases are getting closer to expiration and the rental market shows little sign of improving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank sales have accounted for a higher share of market activity in 2010, making up 13% of all transactions. They accounted for about 7.5% of all deals last year. Much of the increase this year is due to the sale of the White Tower portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the willingness of banks to sell, some observers predict lenders will be careful to make sure the surge in selling doesn't hurt prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The overall level of distressed sales resulting for bank action remains limited," said Peter Damesick, executive director at real-estate-services company <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>. "We expect sales by banks to increase somewhat going forward, but it is likely to be a flow, not a flood."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the global economic crisis hit New York's commercial real estate market, many in the industry predicted one of its first casualties would be Joe Moinian, an Iranian-born rags-to-riches developer who went on a highly leveraged acquisition tear during the boom years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now it's beginning to look like the reports of his impending demise were greatly exaggerated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as he took advantage of cheap debt to enter the pantheon of major New York landlords during the go-go years, Mr. Moinian is now taking advantage of lenders' reluctance to foreclose on property during the downturn to stay there. While a lender has taken back one of his properties, his current holdings still exceed 20 million square feet in New York, Dallas, Chicago, Los Angeles and other cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, Mr. Moinian announced that he had restructured about $400 million of debt backing two downtown properties, 17 Battery Place and 180 Maiden Lane, and arranged $150 million in new financing for the Ocean, a luxury rental apartment building downtown. In his latest workout, Mr. Moinian last month closed on a deal to reduce the interest rate and change other terms to a loan of about $120 million backing the International Jewelry Center in Los Angeles, allowing him to hold on to the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mr. Moinian, 56 years old, is in the end game of his efforts to work out deals with creditors on two of his most high-profile projects: the $240 million development of a W Hotel and condo tower downtown and the $100 million upgrade of 3 Columbus Circle, a 700,000-square-foot office building. Those talks could still break down, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But his success so far in holding on to many properties is an example of how some New York developers who piled on debt during the boom have managed to keep their empires mostly intact despite the worst credit squeeze since the Great Depression. "A lot of investors who lost money in this cycle are going to be given a pass due to the unique nature of the downturn," says Dan Fasulo, a managing director for research firm <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moinian has been advised in some of his restructurings by Robert Verrone, the former head of <span class="companylink">Wachovia Corp</span>.'s commercial real estate unit who was known as "Large Loan Verrone" during the boom years for his deal-making appetite. He left <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> in 2008 and has since been involved in advisory work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Messrs. Moinian and Verrone declined to comment. In a written statement, Mr. Moinian said: "We have stabilized our portfolio to a great extent and will always be vigilant about protecting our assets and tenants/residents, as well as our investment partners."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moinian immigrated to the U.S. from Iran in 1971 by himself at the age of 16. His first job here was working in a restaurant in Forest Hills, Queens, and later he followed in the footsteps of family members who are in the textile business in Iran and started a garment company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moinian began buying loft buildings in the 1980s and gradually bought bigger and more expensive properties. At the height of the bubble his company, the Moinian Group, was one of the most aggressive buyers in New York. When an investor who was buying 95 Wall St. offered to "flip" the property to Mr. Moinian in 2004, Mr. Moinian agreed to do the deal while he was in Orlando—without inspecting the building first, says Yoron Cohen, a <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> commercial real-estate broker who has worked with Mr. Moinian for three decades. Mr. Moinian agreed to buy the building subject to a tour, a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically Mr. Moinian bought low-profile properties, but a few of his deals involved well-known trophy assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, in 2003 he participated in the group that bought Chicago's former Sears Tower, the tallest building in the United States, which last year changed its name to the Willis Tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the financial crisis hit, Mr. Moinian was pressured to enter restructuring talks with lenders on many of his deals. Mr. Moinian and majority partner Westbrook Partners handed back the keys to 475 Fifth Ave. to its lender more than one year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Moinian has mostly been able to hold on. Part of this is because he has been willing to contribute more of his own money to deals. For example, at 180 Maiden Lane, a 40-story tower in the Financial District occupied mainly by insurer <span class="companylink">American International Group Inc</span>., Mr. Moinian contributed $6 million in additional collateral, according to data firm Trepp LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moinian has also taken advantage of an unusual lending environment. Lenders have been wary of foreclosing on property in part because they see few opportunities to sell at acceptable prices and because some are hesitant to take hits on their balance sheets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the commercial real estate market remains precarious and Mr. Moinian still has problems to solve. He has been struggling for months to restructure the debt on 3 Columbus Circle and the W New York Downtown Hotel &amp; Residences at 123 Washington St.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moinian's spokeswoman says that he is "totally current" on the debt on 3 Columbus Circle debt and his talks with creditors of the W Hotel project are "amicable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moinian has faced some issues over unpaid bills. Earlier this year, for example, architecture firm Cetra/Ruddy sued Mr. Moinian's company for nearly $170,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He's a tough guy to do business with, but who isn't these days," architect John Cetra said. He and a spokeswoman for Mr. Moinian both declined to comment on the lawsuit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as he restructures his debts, Mr. Moinian has also moved to alleviate any concern that he is low on cash. The first purchases of condominiums in the 58-story W Hotel and condo project closed this summer. Meantime, the Moinian Group is putting in escrow funds for the "right tenant" interested in leasing space at 3 Columbus Circle to assure them that the landlord is able to complete all interior work and pay broker commissions, Mr. Moinian said in his statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman said tenants have agreed to lease more than one million square feet in Mr. Moinian's portfolio in the last 45 days.</p>

</p><div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">WEEKEND INVESTOR --- How to Beat Deflation --- Strategies to protect your portfolio from -- and take advantage of -- the dreaded 'D' word</span>
</div><div class="author">By Jane J. Kim and Eleanor Laise  </div><div>1738 words</div><div>7 August 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The markets are signaling that a bout of deflation may be coming. Many economists still dismiss the threat. But if they are wrong, and deflation does set in, what would it mean for stocks, bonds, gold and other investments?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time deflation fears gripped the markets was in 2003, when the economy was recovering slowly from the dot-com recession. The worries of a sustained fall in prices across the economy turned out to be overblown as growth snapped back, prices for oil and other commodities jumped, and inflation rose enough for the Federal Reserve to begin tapping on the monetary brakes in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the signs seem more ominous this time around. The core inflation rate rose just 0.9% in June from a year earlier -- among the lowest levels seen since 1966.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And on Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that the core price index for personal-consumption expenditures -- a key inflation gauge watched closely by the Fed -- was up only 1.4% in June from a year earlier, below the 1.5% to 2% rate the Fed likes to see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the bond market, meanwhile, investors have been flocking to all manner of fixed-income investments recently, from Treasurys to "junk" bonds. The attraction: steady interest payments, which would become increasingly valuable if deflation were to take hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How striking has the rally been? Investors have bid up high-grade corporate bonds so much that their yields, which move in the opposite direction to price, now are close to the yields on ultrasafe U.S. Treasury bonds. The yield of the <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>' U.S. Corporate Investment-Grade Index is barely a percentage point above the current 10-year Treasury yield of 2.83%. The spread was about 1.6 points last October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some prominent economists are beginning to sound alarms as well. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, for example, said recently that the risk of deflation has risen, and warned of a period of falling prices and slow growth in the U.S similar to that of Japan in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deflation doesn't mean prices for goods and services will plunge -- that rarely happens. But the longer prices edge lower, the bigger the changes in behavior for consumers and businesses. As corporate profits drop, managers tend to lay off more workers and cut spending, while consumers, expecting lower prices in the future, pull back on buying, weighing on profits even more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You will know you are in period of true deflation when there is a sustained decline in prices over a couple of years, not just a negative core CPI reading for a few months, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that deflation is much more difficult to stop than its cousin, inflation. Central bankers can raise interest rates sharply to stop rising prices, but they can cut interest rates only as far as zero; after that they have to get creative to put more money into circulation. It can be like pushing on a string.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plenty of economists doubt a long period of deflation will unfold in the U.S. Unlike Japan, which saw steady declines in wages and productivity during the 1990s, the U.S. has had relatively stable growth in both recently, says Tom Porcelli, U.S. market economist at <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span>. "Structurally, we are a different animal from what Japan went through," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has said the central bank would do whatever it can to prevent significant deflation in the U.S. In a now-famous 2002 speech, while he was a Fed governor, he said, "The U.S. government has a technology, called a printing press . . . that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost," and thus fight deflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, if the Fed were to turn on its money machine full blast, that could spark inflationary pressures over the longer term, bringing a whole new set of investing challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some money managers are playing both scenarios, investing with an eye on deflation in the short-term and inflation later on. "We're not sure which side the bubble is on," says David Scott, chief investment officer at Sunrise Advisors Inc. of Leawood, Kan., who is buying inflation hedges -- such as a silver exchange-traded fund and commodity funds -- and deflation hedges like cash and short-term bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If deflation does kick in over the next several months, here is how it might affect your portfolio, from stocks and bonds to cash and real estate:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deflation is generally bad news for stocks, since a period of falling prices and weak demand tends to weigh down corporate earnings and, therefore, share prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that doesn't mean investors concerned about deflation should avoid stocks entirely. Companies with plenty of cash, low debt, steady dividends and products that people will buy even in tough economic times should fare relatively well, analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if inflation does come roaring back in the longer term, these companies might still do well because they tend to have significant pricing power. That means they can raise prices to compensate for their own rising costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many stocks in the consumer-staples sector will likely hold up well in a deflationary period, money managers and analysts say. Investors should seek out companies that dominate their industries, such as spice maker <span class="companylink">McCormick &amp;Co</span>., says Josh Peters, editor of Morningstar DividendInvestor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One sector that warrants caution: financials. As borrowers struggle to pay off debts, lenders could face more defaults. And as loans are paid down, there may be little demand for new borrowing. Both would hurt profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bonds</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a deflationary environment, longer-term government bonds tend to do well. As investors rush to the safety of Treasuries, yields drop and prices jump, resulting in higher total returns. Hence the recent rally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond-fund manager Jeffrey Gundlach -- who thinks yields on the 10-year Treasury note could fall to 2% -- has about 40% of the DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund's assets in longer-term government debt, such as Ginnie Mae securities. If yields on 10-year Treasurys fall to 2% within a year, investors could reap total returns of 10% to 12% as the price of the securities jump, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zero-coupon Treasury bonds, known as strips, can provide the best protection, since the fixed rates are locked in and automatically reinvested at the fixed rate, says Troy Von Haefen, a financial adviser in Nashville, Tenn., who primarily uses Treasury strips as a deflation hedge and holds them to maturity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conversely, inflation-linked securities such as TIPS (Treasury inflation-protected securities) and I Bonds (inflation-linked savings bonds) could lose value in a period of sustained deflation. When the consumer price index turned negative in 2009, for example, rates on I Bonds temporarily dropped to 0%. Investors could see the value of their TIPS decline, since any negative change in the CPI would be applied to TIPS' principal, reducing the interest earned. (If investors buy TIPS at auction and hold the bonds until maturity, the Treasury pays the inflation-adjusted principal or the original principal, whichever is greater.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Janet Briaud, a financial adviser in Bryan, Texas, sold her clients' holdings in TIPS, parked the proceeds in cash and has been putting as much as 20% of clients' money in long-term government bonds. "If markets come down over the next 18 months, we expect that investors will go to the safe haven of Treasury bonds," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash is king in a deflationary world. While investors may not earn much interest, cash gains in value as prices fall. "If you're concerned about deflation in the short-term, cash gives you the best flexibility," says Greg McBride, senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid a flight to safety, yields on money-market mutual funds have fallen to near-record lows, even as banks are more inclined to cut yields on deposit products. Just last week, <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. cut some rates on CDs. Average yields on one- and five-year CDs have fallen from 3.77% and 4.03%, respectively, in August 2007, to 0.66% and 1.93%, according to Bankrate.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But consumers can find higher yields at smaller community banks or credit unions and other financial institutions. The banking units of <span class="companylink">SLM Corp</span>.'s Sallie Mae and <span class="companylink">Discover Financial Services</span> are offering one-year CDs of 1.5% or more, while NewDominionDirect.com is paying 2% on two-year CDs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hard Assets</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deflation generally means falling prices for commodities, real estate and other hard assets. But as with stocks, investors shouldn't write off the category altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold, which many investors consider an inflation hedge, also can be a useful deflation-fighting tool, analysts say. The government tends to respond to deflationary concerns by printing money, which in turn can spark fears of inflation and drive up the price of the metal. Gold is a hedge against financial stress, and "the source of stress doesn't matter, whether deflationary or inflationary," says Joe Foster, manager of the Van Eck International Investors Gold Fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a deflationary period, investors should be especially wary of commercial and residential real estate and the real estate investment trusts that invest in such properties, analysts say. Much of the value of real estate is predicated on an ability to raise rents, says Morningstar's Mr. Peters. A lack of inflation, little rent-raising power and low occupancy rates, he says, "could come back to hammer this group a second time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deflation generally isn't kind to debtors. "If you have $1,000 in debt, and if prices are falling, it will cost you more in terms of forgone goods and services," says Kris Mitchener, an economics professor at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the extent that you have to take on any debt, opt for as short a term as possible, says David Hultstrom, a financial adviser in Woodstock, Ga., who would counsel clients to pay off their mortgages and invest in long-term bonds if they expect a deflationary environment. "You don't want to get locked in."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The markets are signaling that a bout of deflation may be coming. Many economists still dismiss the threat. But if they are wrong, and deflation does set in, what would it mean for stocks, bonds, gold and other investments?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time deflation fears gripped the markets was in 2003, when the economy was recovering slowly from the dot-com recession. The worries of a sustained fall in prices across the economy turned out to be overblown as growth snapped back, prices for oil and other commodities jumped, and inflation rose enough for the Federal Reserve to begin tapping on the monetary brakes in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the signs seem more ominous this time around. The core inflation rate rose just 0.9% in June from a year earlier—among the lowest levels seen since 1966.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And on Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that the core price index for personal-consumption expenditures—a key inflation gauge watched closely by the Fed—was up only 1.4% in June from a year earlier, below the 1.5% to 2% rate the Fed likes to see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the bond market, meanwhile, investors have been flocking to all manner of fixed-income investments recently, from Treasurys to "junk" bonds. The attraction: steady interest payments, which would become increasingly valuable if deflation were to take hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How striking has the rally been? Investors have bid up high-grade corporate bonds so much that their yields, which move in the opposite direction to price, now are close to the yields on ultrasafe U.S. Treasury bonds. The yield of the <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>' U.S. Corporate Investment-Grade Index is barely a percentage point above the current 10-year Treasury yield of 2.83%. The spread was about 1.6 points last October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some prominent economists are beginning to sound alarms as well. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, for example, said recently that the risk of deflation has risen, and warned of a period of falling prices and slow growth in the U.S similar to that of Japan in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deflation doesn't mean prices for goods and services will plunge—that rarely happens. But the longer prices edge lower, the bigger the changes in behavior for consumers and businesses. As corporate profits drop, managers tend to lay off more workers and cut spending, while consumers, expecting lower prices in the future, pull back on buying, weighing on profits even more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You will know you are in period of true deflation when there is a sustained decline in prices over a couple of years, not just a negative core CPI reading for a few months, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that deflation is much more difficult to stop than its cousin, inflation. Central bankers can raise interest rates sharply to stop rising prices, but they can cut interest rates only as far as zero; after that they have to get creative to put more money into circulation. It can be like pushing on a string.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plenty of economists doubt a long period of deflation will unfold in the U.S. Unlike Japan, which saw steady declines in wages and productivity during the 1990s, the U.S. has had relatively stable growth in both recently, says Tom Porcelli, U.S. market economist at <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span>. "Structurally, we are a different animal from what Japan went through," he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, if the Fed were to turn on its money machine full blast, that could spark inflationary pressures over the longer term, bringing a whole new set of investing challenges.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1886, railroad magnate E.H. Harriman paid $52,500 for 7,863 acres in Orange County, where he built a 100,000-square-foot mansion. Now, the mansion and about 450 acres of land around it are on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arden House, an estate built atop a 1,300-foot mountain in the Ramapo range, is being sold by Open Space Institute, a conservation group based in New York. The price is to be determined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1950, Mr. Harriman's son, W. Averell Harriman, who once served as New York's governor, deeded Arden House to Columbia University under then university President Dwight Eisenhower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property housed the American Assembly, a public-policy institution, and eventually was used by the Columbia Business School's program for executives who took classes on weekends. The vast remainder of the land became Harriman State Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, OSI bought the property from Columbia University for $4.5 million. But the group now plans to sell the estate for asset deployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers marketing the property say that so far, they have received offers of $10 million this time around. The brokers, working at Colliers International, have determined that its best use would be by educational institutions or think tanks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billed as "America's first conference center," Arden House, a National Historic Landmark, is deeded for sales to educational, cultural, and related nonprofits. OSI is seeking out nonprofit buyers initially—since brokers think a nonprofit would be more likely to buy it in the current market. But if that fails, a for-profit company could negotiate a long-term lease with OSI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given that we want a nonprofit owner and that the real-estate market has declined, I think, recognizing that whoever wants to use it will have to invest to bring it up to modern standards, we would be interested in something less than our purchase price," said Kim Elliman, OSI's chief executive. A conservation easement on the property also prevents development on all but 50 acres, including the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding a buyer may be about more than money. "We want a user who is going to be easy to work with and consistent with our conservation policies," Mr. Elliman said, adding that he wouldn't sell it to a hunting group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property has a large outdoor pool, a music room, sweeping views of surrounding parkland, 97 guest rooms, a lake, an auditorium, and even a defunct bowling alley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it needs work. To bring it up to modern standards, the buyer would need to sink in about 30% of its cost, according to Jim Stuckey, dean of New York University's Schack Institute of Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Mr. Elliman, for optimal use the facility would need upgraded water, work on the access road, a heating tune-up, centralized air conditioning and Wi-Fi. The last major update was in the 1980s. "There will have to be some TLC," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OSI now pays about $100,000 a year to maintain the site Mr. Elliman said. With light and heat, he estimated it would add up to $250,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arden House is 40 miles north of the city, or about an hour and a half's drive from Midtown Manhattan. It would be recognized by bargain hunters because of its proximity to the Woodbury Commons Shopping Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When many barons were building European-style castles upstate more than 100 years ago, Mr. Harriman asserted his preference for all things domestic by having Arden House built with American craftsmen and materials. Most of the stone in Arden House even came from the estate's mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not an architectural gem but it's interesting," Mr. Elliman said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities gained Tuesday as weak economic data further fanned expectations that the Federal Reserve may need to restart its asset purchases to support the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two-year yield was pushed down to a record low of 0.515% at one point during the day, as the price rose, after surprisingly weak reports on consumer spending, pending home sales and factory orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk that the Fed could revive its bond purchase program was set off by a Wall Street Journal article that said policy makers will consider changing the way the bank manages its securities portfolio at next week's meeting. The Fed could use the cash from its maturing mortgage bond holdings—about $200 billion in 2011—to purchase new mortgage bonds or Treasurys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While the technical impact of rolling MBS proceeds into new Treasurys would not be large, it is a signal to the market that the Fed is concerned and willing to do more to support the economy," said John Briggs, U.S. interest rate strategist at RBS Securities Inc. in Stamford, Conn. "It will push even further out the date for the first Fed rate hike," and lower rates overall, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed has already pledged to keep rates ultra-low for an extended period which has helped keep Treasurys yields low and borrowing costs down for consumers and corporations. The two-year note's yield, among the most sensitive to changes in official rate policy outlook, has consistently hit fresh record lows over the past two weeks. It ended up 2/32 point or $0.625 for every $1,000 invested, to yield 0.546%. Yields fall when prices rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year note rose 13/32 point to yield 2.916%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Fed opts to buy Treasurys, the 10-year yield could initially fall another half percentage point, analysts estimate, similar to the drop seen when the central bank started to buy Treasurys last year. But in the end, the $300 billion in Treasury purchases lowered yields by a smaller 0.20 to 0.40 point, said Chris Bury, co-head of fixed income at <span class="companylink">Jefferies &amp; Co</span>. The Fed's purchases—which ran from March to October 2009—didn't stop the 10-year yield from briefly rising above 4% in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage bonds also benefited from the chatter, even though many think the Fed isn't likely to buy these securities if it decides to relaunch its purchase program. It has already purchased $1.25 trillion of mortgage securities in a program that ended in March and would be wary of driving up prices in an already expensive market, where some bonds are trading at record high prices, traders said. Supply of new mortgage bonds has been low as the housing market continues to struggle. Mortgage rates are at record lows—the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is at 4.54%— and mortgage bond risk premiums over Treasurys are also close to historic lows. Tuesday they stood at 1.32 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It makes sense for the Fed to buy short-term Treasurys, and stay away from mortgages," said David Cannon, global co-head of asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities trading at RBS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Junk-Bond Issuers Sell $1.75 Billion in Debt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speculative-grade corporate borrowers flooded the junk-bond market with more than $1.75 billion in newly minted notes Tuesday, joining dozens of higher-rated companies that have come to market this summer to take advantage of unusually low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Junk-bond issuance continues to be driven by companies—<span class="companylink">Petrohawk Energy Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Tenet Healthcare</span> among them—looking to sell bonds at a time of low interest rates to refinance existing debt at lower costs, extend debt maturities, or both. Modest coupons on new deals have belied the speculative-grade market's "high yield" moniker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average yield on speculative-grade debt is 8.27%, according to <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>, hovering near the lowest level since early May, as investors again embrace riskier notes when returns on Treasurys and investment-grade corporate bonds have reached historic lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Junk bonds sputtered in May and June but found their footing in July, returning 3.56%. Companies sold $14.3 billion of speculative-grade last month, among the highest July totals on record, according to <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>. The market was helped by investors pouring $2.79 billion into high-yield mutual funds in the four weeks ending July 28, the strongest four-week period since early June 2009. That momentum is carrying over into early August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Petrohawk Energy</span> led on Tuesday, selling $825 million of senior unsecured 8-year notes to yield 7.25%, which it will use to retire existing debt—saving 1.875 percentage points in interest costs while buying an extra seven years before that debt matures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other companies followed similar blueprints. Tenet sold $600 million in senior unsecured 10-year notes—which carry the riskiest triple-C speculative-grade ratings—at an 8% yield. Tenet will use proceeds to buy back its existing 7.375% senior notes due 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Junk bonds have been holding firm in secondary market trade this week although trading levels remain muted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All the attention is going to the new issues," said Greg Hopper, high-yield fund manager at <span class="companylink">Artio Global Investors</span>, adding that "we still think there's plenty of value out there."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of pending home sales dipped in June, continuing a decline tied to the expiration of a tax credit for home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' pending homes sales index, a leading indicator for the housing sector, fell 2.6% to 75.7. The measure, which was down 18.6% from its June 2009 level, tracks transactions for existing homes in which a contract has been signed but the deal has not yet closed. Closings tend to occur one or two months after a contract signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index tumbled 30% in May after the government's April 30 deadline for contract signings to be eligible for the federal tax credit. Those sales must close by Sept. 30 to receive the tax break.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because home buyers rushed to sign deals ahead of the April 30 deadline, sales activity was expected to weaken throughout the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There could be a couple of additional months of slow home-sales activity before picking up later in the year, provided the job market continues to improve," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales were worst in the Northeast, which dropped 12.2%. The Midwest fell 9.5%, while the West slipped just 0.2%. The South, the area in the U.S. with the most housing activity, rose 3.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ample inventories and high unemployment are likely to keep the housing market under pressure in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outlook for housing demand this year "remains very uncertain," said Yelena Shulyatyeva, an analyst at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>. "Only when jobs start being created at a sufficient pace will potential home buyers get back to the market, and home sales return to sustainable healthy levels."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department said Tuesday that factory orders fell in June for the second-straight month. New orders for U.S. manufactured goods declined 1.2% to $406 billion, in part as a result of fewer orders for construction machinery and defense communications equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a key gauge of investment by business—nondefense capital-goods orders excluding aircraft—increased 0.2% in June from May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New data showing a drop in factory inventories of nondurable goods in June suggest the economy grew less in the second quarter than the 2.4% the Commerce Department estimated on Friday, based on preliminary data. <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> economist Ted Wieseman estimated that growth will be revised down to 1.9%, while <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span>'s Michael Feroli put it closer to 1.7%. But Maury Harris of <span class="companylink">UBS</span>, who also put the expected revision at 1.9%, noted that other elements of the gross domestic product are likely to be revised as well, possibly muting the inventory effect.</p>

</div><div class="author">By                         Lingling Wei                                    And Dinny McMahon   </div><div>1132 words</div><div>4 August 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a major push into the battered U.S. commercial real-estate market, China's $300 billion sovereign-wealth fund is in advanced talks with Harvard University's endowment to buy its stakes in half a dozen U.S.-focused real-estate funds for about $500 million, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal would follow commitments that <span class="companylink">China Investment Corp</span>., or CIC, has made to invest $1 billion in funds managed by <span class="companylink">Brookfield Asset Management</span>, headquartered in both Toronto and New York, and $1 billion to Cornerstone Real Estate Advisers, of Hartford, Conn., people with knowledge of the situation say. Representatives at CIC, Harvard, Brookfield and Cornerstone declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deals reflect a broader push by CIC to deploy its capital after staying largely on the sidelines amid the global financial crises. With more capital available than any other investor in the world, CIC has increased the proportion of assets allocated to higher-risk assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move also contrasts with the retreat from commercial real estate by many American institutional investors, like Harvard, that are struggling with large investments made in the sector during the boom years. The transaction is expected to close in the next couple of months, though it could still fall apart as terms haven't been finalized, these people say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Current terms of the Harvard deal weren't available. But over the past year, real-estate funds have been offered for as much as 80% below net asset value, industry experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CIC is looking to boost exposure to U.S. real estate in a way that avoids the political and public-relations backlash that often accompanies foreign investment in high-profile U.S. assets. In 2005, for example, such an outcry helped convince <span class="companylink">Cnooc Ltd</span>., a large Chinese oil concern, to drop its bid for <span class="companylink">Unocal Corp</span>. To limit such potential fallout, CIC has targeted investment funds rather than specific properties partly to avoid such a stigma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CIC also is timing its foray into the U.S. market to avoid the mistake of overpaying for U.S. real estate. Commercial property today is particularly appealing to foreign investors because values are around 20-year lows and more than $1 trillion of property debt is set to mature in the next five years. That is causing huge headaches for U.S. landlords and creditors, but it means opportunities for cash-rich investors looking to fill funding needs and rack up handsome returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harvard's real-estate portfolio had a loss of more than 50% in the year that ended June 2009, according to the latest available performance report by <span class="companylink">Harvard Management Co</span>., which oversees the endowment. Since 2009, the $26 billion Harvard endowment, the largest of any major U.S. college, has been trying to pare down its $5.4 billion real-estate portfolio as it seeks to cut its exposure to illiquid assets like real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund's aggressive push into these asset classes left it without enough cash to meet its obligations when the financial crisis erupted two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harvard has tapped bankers at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> and <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group</span> to try to sell its partnership interests in a number of real-estate funds, people with knowledge of the situation said. Both firms' representatives declined to comment. Some of the largest real-estate commitments Harvard has made are with fund managers, including Lubert-Adler, Beacon Capital Partners and Westbrook Partners, the people said. The largest single commitment Harvard has made is $500 million in Lubert-Adler Fund VI, whose holdings include a six-million-square-foot mixed-use development project in Stamford, Conn., and a shopping mall in San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other foreign investors also are looking to take advantage of low values in U.S. real estate. In the second quarter, investors from Canada, South Korea, the Netherlands, Kuwait and other countries acquired about $2.2 billion of skyscrapers and other properties in the U.S., more than five times the amount seen a year earlier, according to research firm <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, a group of investors, including Korean Federation of Community Credit Cooperatives, paid $333 million for a 655,398-square-foot, fully leased office building at 333 Market St. in San Francisco. In another large deal, <span class="companylink">CPP Investment Board</span>, which invests on behalf of the Canadian Pension Plan, paid $576 million for a 45% interest in the 1.6 million-square-foot McGraw-Hill Building, at 1221 Ave. of the Americas in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the current inflow of foreign capital still pales in comparison to the levels seen from 2003 to early 2008. For example, overseas investments totaled about $8.7 billion in the third quarter of 2007 alone, the peak of the property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the woes in the U.S. marketplace might work in the favor of CIC and other foreign investors. U.S. real-estate executives are lobbying Congress to amend tax law to encourage overseas capital to flow into U.S. real estate, thus helping prevent a further decline in commercial-property values. In the early 1980s, Congress approved a tax on capital gains from foreign sales of U.S. property to discourage foreign investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unclear how much CIC intends to allocate to U.S. real estate. CIC issued its second-ever annual report on Thursday but didn't say how large a role property investment plays in its portfolio. Michael McCormack, an executive director at Z-Ben Advisors, a consulting firm in Shanghai, estimates that less than $5 billion, or 5%, of the fund's global portfolio is invested in real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People familiar with the situation say that CIC's funds have been almost fully invested and that it has applied to Beijing for a capital injection. At the end of last year, it had about $332.4 billion of assets under management, of which only $16.4 billion was held in cash and deposits, down more than 70% from a year earlier. About $81.1 billion of CIC's funds were invested outside China at the end of 2009. CIC posted an 11.7% return on its overseas investments last year, reversing a 2.1% decline in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McCormack says that assuming CIC gets allocated a further $100 billion, he expects it to invest an additional $10 billion to $15 billion in property over the next 18 months. Real-estate funds are "a good bet when you need to make a big investment and yet still stay under the radar," he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one of the most high-profile signs so far that foreign capital is swooping in on distressed U.S. property, China's $300 billion sovereign-wealth fund is in advanced talks with Harvard University's endowment to buy the university's stakes in half a dozen U.S.-focused real-estate funds for about $500 million, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representatives at CIC and Harvard declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CIC is looking to boost its exposure to U.S. real estate, and the fund is hoping to learn from the mistakes of other foreign investors who were clobbered by political and financial repercussions from their acquisitions of U.S. property. For example, there was an enormous backlash against the Japanese two decades ago, when investors from that country purchased such American trophies as Rockefeller Center and the Pebble Beach golf course in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To limit the public-relations and political fallout, CIC has targeted investment funds rather than specific properties partly to avoid such a stigma. Besides negotiating with Harvard, CIC recently made a $1 billion commitment to U.S. real-estate funds managed by <span class="companylink">Brookfield Asset Management Inc</span>., headquartered in both Toronto and New York, and a $1 billion commitment to Cornerstone Real Estate Advisers, of Hartford, Conn., according to people familiar with the matter.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of pending home sales dipped in June, continuing a decline tied to the expiration of a tax credit for home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, U.S. consumer spending and personal incomes, key drivers of economic growth, were both flat in June, according to the Commerce Department on Tuesday, pointing to a weaker economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' pending homes sales index, a leading indicator for the housing sector, fell 2.6% to 75.7. The measure, down 18.6% from its June 2009 level, tracks transactions for existing homes in which a contract has been signed but the deal hasn't yet closed.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ample inventories and high unemployment are likely to keep the housing market under pressure in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department's consumer spending figure was unchanged last month after growing a revised 0.1% in May. The May figure was originally reported as a 0.2% rise. Personal incomes were also flat in June, as private wages and salaries fell. Incomes in May rose 0.3%, slightly less than what the government had previously reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the U.S. economy began emerging from the recession in the second half of 2009, the high unemployment rate has taken a toll on consumer purchases and weighs heavily on the recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the economy looking weak, Americans are saving more. The report showed that U.S. consumers boosted savings in June and May. Americans last month saved $725.9 billion as the national saving rate rose to 6.4% from 6.3% in May. In April, the savings rate stood at 6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, Commerce said factory orders fell in June for the second-straight month. New orders for U.S. manufactured goods declined 1.2% to $406 billion, in part as a result of fewer orders for construction machinery and defense communications equipment. But a key gauge of investment by business -- nondefense capital-goods orders excluding aircraft -- rose 0.2% from May to June.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of pending home sales dipped in June, continuing a decline tied to the expiration of a tax credit for home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' pending home sales index, a leading indicator for the housing sector, fell 2.6% to 75.7. The measure, which was down 18.6% from its June 2009 level, tracks transactions for existing homes in which a contract has been signed but the deal has not yet closed. Closings tend to occur one or two months after a contract signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index tumbled 30% in May after the government's April 30 deadline for contract signings to be eligible for the federal tax credit. Those sales must close by Sept. 30 to receive the tax break.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because home buyers rushed to sign deals ahead of the April 30 deadline, sales activity was expected to weaken throughout the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There could be a couple of additional months of slow home-sales activity before picking up later in the year, provided the job market continues to improve," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales were worst in the Northeast, dropping 12.2%. Sales in the Midwest fell 9.5%; the West slipped 0.2%. Sales in the South rose 3.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ample inventories and high unemployment are likely to keep the housing market under pressure. The outlook for housing demand this year "remains very uncertain," said Yelena Shulyatyeva, an analyst at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>. "Only when jobs start being created at a sufficient pace will potential home buyers get back to the market, and home sales return to sustainable healthy levels."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department said Tuesday that factory orders fell in June for the second straight month. New orders for U.S. manufactured goods declined 1.2% to $406 billion. But a key gauge of investment by business -- nondefense capital-goods orders excluding aircraft -- increased 0.2% in June from May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New data showing a drop in factory inventories of nondurable goods in June suggest the economy grew less in the second quarter than the 2.4% the Commerce Department estimated on Friday, based on preliminary data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> economist Ted Wieseman estimated that growth will be revised down to 1.9%, while <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span>'s Michael Feroli put it at 1.7%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Min Zeng, Prabha Natarajan and Deborah Lynn Blumberg </div><div>783 words</div><div>4 August 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C11</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities gained Tuesday as weak economic data further fanned expectations that the Federal Reserve may need to restart its asset purchases to support the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two-year yield was pushed down to a record low of 0.515% at one point, as the price rose, after surprisingly weak reports on consumer spending, pending home sales and factory orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk that the Fed could revive its bond purchase program was set off by a Wall Street Journal article that said policy makers will consider changing the way the bank manages its securities portfolio at next week's meeting. The Fed could use the cash from its maturing mortgage bond holdings -- about $200 billion in 2011 -- to purchase new mortgage bonds or Treasurys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While the technical impact of rolling MBS proceeds into new Treasurys would not be large, it is a signal to the market that the Fed is concerned and willing to do more to support the economy," said John Briggs, U.S. interest rate strategist at RBS Securities Inc. in Stamford, Conn. "It will push even further out the date for the first Fed rate hike," and lower rates overall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed has already pledged to keep rates ultralow for an extended period which has helped keep Treasurys yields low and borrowing costs down for consumers and corporations. The two-year note's yield, among the most sensitive to changes in official rate policy outlook, has consistently hit fresh record lows over the past two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It ended up 2/32 point or $0.625 for every $1,000 invested, to yield 0.546%. Yields fall when prices rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year note rose 13/32 point to yield 2.916%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Fed opts to buy Treasurys, the 10-year yield could initially fall another half percentage point, analysts estimate, similar to the drop seen when the central bank started to buy Treasurys last year. But in the end, the $300 billion in Treasury purchases lowered yields by a smaller 0.20 to 0.40 point, said Chris Bury, co-head of fixed income at <span class="companylink">Jefferies &amp;Co</span>. The Fed's purchases -- which ran from March to October 2009 -- didn't stop the 10-year yield from briefly rising above 4% in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage bonds also benefited from the chatter, even though many think the Fed isn't likely to buy these securities if it decides to relaunch its purchase program. It already has purchased $1.25 trillion of mortgage securities in a program that ended in March and would be wary of driving up prices in an already expensive market, where some bonds are trading at record high prices, traders said. Supply of new mortgage bonds has been low as the housing market continues to struggle. Mortgage rates are at record lows -- the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is at 4.54% -- and mortgage bond risk premiums over Treasurys are also close to historic lows. Tuesday they stood at 1.32 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It makes sense for the Fed to buy short-term Treasurys, and stay away from mortgages," said David Cannon, global co-head of asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities trading at RBS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Junk-Bond Issuers Sell</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$1.75 Billion in Debt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speculative-grade corporate borrowers flooded the "junk" bond market with more than $1.75 billion in newly minted notes Tuesday, joining dozens of higher-rated companies that have come to market this summer to take advantage of unusually low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Junk-bond issuance continues to be driven by companies -- <span class="companylink">Petrohawk Energy Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Tenet Healthcare</span> among them -- looking to sell bonds at a time of low interest rates to refinance existing debt at lower costs, extend debt maturities, or both. Modest coupons on new deals have belied the speculative-grade market's "high yield" moniker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average yield on speculative-grade debt is 8.27%, according to <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>, hovering near the lowest level since early May, as investors again embrace riskier notes when returns on Treasurys and investment-grade corporate bonds have reached historic lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Junk bonds sputtered in May and June but found their footing in July, returning 3.56%. Companies sold $14.3 billion of speculative-grade last month, among the highest July totals on record, according to <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>. The market was helped by investors pouring $2.79 billion into high-yield mutual funds in the four weeks ended July 28.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK—Consumer-discretionary stocks were among the weakest performers as data showed U.S. consumer spending was flat in June and pending home sales fell again during that month, reigniting worries about the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retailers and other discretionary stocks have been under pressure in recent weeks on trepidation about the rate of the economy's recovery. Negative economic data and concerns about Europe's health have worried retail investors, who are anxiously looking toward results from the key back-to-school shopping season. The big data point for the industry is July same-store sales, to be released Thursday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to worries was data showing consumer spending, a key driver of economic growth, was unchanged last month after growing a revised 0.1% in May. The May figure was originally reported as a 0.2% rise, the Commerce Department said in its monthly report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal incomes were also flat in June as private wages and salaries fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Retail Index fell 1.9%, down 16% over the past three months. The S&amp;P 500 slid 0.5%, down 6.8% over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the decliners was <span class="companylink">OfficeMax Inc</span>., which dropped 13%, after cutting its 2010 sales view and projecting third-quarter sales down slightly from the previous year. The outlook also weighed on shares of <span class="companylink">Office Depot Inc</span>., down 2.1%, and <span class="companylink">Staples Inc</span>., down 4.4% to $19.92.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luxury retailers also took a hit, with <span class="companylink">Coach Inc</span>. slumping 3.4%. While fiscal fourth-quarter results appeared to top estimates, <span class="companylink">Wall Street Strategies</span> analyst Brian Sozzi noted one extra week of sales provided the upside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Strip out the influence from the extra week, and Coach had an in-line quarter in spite of solid gross margin expansion, operating expense control, and 10.9 million in share repurchases," he said. He noted that margins declined sequentially for the first time in more than three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of other luxury retailers trading lower included jewelry retailer <span class="companylink">Tiffany &amp; Co</span>., and upscale department chain <span class="companylink">Saks Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Department-store operators in general slumped, including shares of <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney Co</span>. falling 8.2% and <span class="companylink">Kohl's Corp</span>. losing 4% .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders traded lower too as the National Association of Realtors' index for pending sales of used homes decreased by 2.6% to 75.7 in June. Home sales have fallen two straight months as a tax credit for buyers expired April 30, and economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected pending home sales would be flat in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>. fell 6.1% and <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> lost 4%. <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>. shares dropped 5.8% as investors worried about orders despite the building giant reporting it swung to a fiscal third-quarter profit.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-capitalization stocks jumped on better-than-expected earnings reports and encouraging manufacturing data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong earnings Monday from large-cap European banks boosted global markets. U.S. stocks followed, gaining steam after the Institute for Supply Management's July manufacturing survey beat forecasts and construction spending in June unexpectedly increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks gained 10.97 points, or 1.7%, to 661.86. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> SmallCap 600 index climbed 5.84 points, or 1.7%, to 354.34. All of its sectors closed in the black.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While investors said second-quarter earnings have been encouraging, many small-cap stocks have yet to report. Chris Hobart, founder of Hobart Financial Group, said expectations for small-cap companies are high after so many large-cap stocks exceeded both earnings and revenue expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Monday underlined that the economy isn't out of the woods yet. Mr. Bernanke said the U.S. has a "considerable way to go to achieve a full recovery in our economy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ripples in the U.S. economy likely would weigh more on smaller companies, Mr. Hobart said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're still very fragile, and small-caps will be the ones to feel that quicker than the large ones will," he said. For purposes of this column, small-caps are considered those companies with a market capitalization of less than $2 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Materials climbed highest Monday, boosted by the manufacturing data and better-than-expected earnings. Leading the sector, specialty polymer materials firm <span class="companylink">PolyOne</span> jumped $1.15, or 11%, to $11.46, after swinging to a second-quarter profit and reporting record earnings and margins from its specialty and distribution businesses. Building-products company Headwaters gained 24 cents, or 6.9%, to 3.70. Both are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a day when investors embraced riskier assets, safer consumer staples lagged. Brewer <span class="companylink">Boston Beer</span> (NYSE), shed 1.76, or 2.5%, to 67.60. Chicken processor <span class="companylink">Sanderson Farms</span> slipped 93 cents, or 2%, to 45.82.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Casino operator <span class="companylink">Boyd Gaming</span> (NYSE) gained 55 cents, or 6.5%, to 9.01, after giving up its year-and-a-half effort to take over certain assets of its chief rival, bankrupt <span class="companylink">Station Casinos</span>. The Las Vegas company's chief executive, Keith Smith, said the assets' potential value is limited and that the pursuit no longer makes sense for Boyd "given the bidding procedures that favor Station insiders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Book retailer <span class="companylink">Barnes &amp; Noble</span> (NYSE) got a boost after Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal began a preliminary review of agreements between the nation's largest electronic book publishers and online retailer <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span> and Apple, saying he is concerned the pacts could be anticompetitive. <span class="companylink">Barnes &amp; Noble</span> rose 85 cents, or 6.6%, to 13.82.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York Times (NYSE) climbed 58 cents, or 6.6%, to 9.32, after the New York newspaper publisher said it would unveil Press Engine, a technology and design platform that will allow publishers and media organizations to deliver content across devices such as Apple's iPhone and iPad. The platform is expected to launch in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For-profit educator Corinthian Colleges rose 15 cents, or 1.7%, to 9.25, after saying it plans to buy back up to $200 million of common stock, which BMO Capital estimates could add up to 49 cents to fiscal 2011 per-share earnings at the Santa Ana, Calif., company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank-holding company <span class="companylink">First Commonwealth Financial</span> (NYSE) fell 25 cents, or 4.7%, to 5.05, after the Indiana, Pa., company said it plans to offer $75 million of common stock to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">WSFS Financial</span>, the parent of Wilmington Savings Fund Society, slid 1.78, or 4.7%, to 36.22, after deciding to offer about $40 million in stock, increasing shares outstanding by about 15%. The Wilmington, Del., company plans to use the proceeds for organic growth or to finance its June acquisition of <span class="companylink">National Penn Bancshares</span>' <span class="companylink">Christiana Bank &amp; Trust</span> business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Industries (NYSE), which makes components for manufactured homes and recreational-vehicle parts, climbed 92 cents, or 4.4% to 22.05, after its second-quarter earnings beat analysts' expectations. The White Plains, N.Y., company benefited from an increase in industrywide wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth-wheel RVs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Auto-parts maker <span class="companylink">Standard Motor Products</span> (NYSE) rose 33 cents, or 3.4%, to 10.13, after its second-quarter earnings topped Street expectations. The Long Island City, N.Y., company benefited from cost-cutting actions started over the past few years and saw strong sales for both engine management and temperature control.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stock investors welcomed August with a bang on the back of encouraging manufacturing and construction spending data and better-than-expected European bank earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 188.61 points, or 1.8%, to 10654.25 in early afternoon trading, adding to a July that saw the Dow gain 7.1%, its biggest monthly climb since July 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks were helped by a better-than-expected July reading of the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index and an unexpected climb in June construction spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market had burst out the gate with triple-digit gains following stronger-than-expected quarterly reports from European banks that fueled a global rally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.6% to 2290.34. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500-stock index jumped 2% to 1123.30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies with significant global exposure led the Dow's climb as confidence mounted in the overseas economic recovery. <span class="companylink">Alcoa</span> jumped 3.4%, while DuPont gained 2.4%. Technology components climbed; <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span> gained 3.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financials were boosted by upbeat earnings from <span class="companylink">HSBC Holdings</span> and <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>. <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> advanced 2.8% and <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> rose 2.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy stocks jumped as crude-oil prices climbed above $81 a barrel and investors scurried toward riskier assets. <span class="companylink">Exxon Mobil</span> rose 3.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European stocks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares climbed on upbeat economic data, solid earnings from the banking sector and a jump in commodity prices that drove basic resources shares higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">HSBC</span>, Europe's largest bank by market capitalization, gave a positive jolt to sentiment when it reported that net profit for the first half of 2010 doubled compared with the year-ago period. Impairment charges fell sharply and the bank booked a gain on the value of its own debt. The stock surged 5.3% in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">France's <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> also reported better-than-expected second-quarter net profit, as robust retail operations and lower bad-loan provisions more than offset a slide in its investment-banking business. Its shares also climbed 5.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stoxx Europe 600 index rose 2.6% to 262.09. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 added 2.6% to 5397.11 and Germany's DAX gained 2.3% to 6292.13. France's CAC-40 finished 3.0% higher at 3752.03.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp;Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prudential Financial Inc. bought out its partner's stake in a Robbinsville, N.J., warehouse in 2006 in a deal that valued the building at $72 million. Prudential invested a total of $48 million in the project. An article on the Commercial Property page Monday incorrectly said Prudential paid $72 million for the whole building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ August 3, 2010)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROBBINSVILLE, N.J. -- Birds chirp and the nearby highway hums. Those sounds aside, the vast asphalt parking lots surrounding many of the giant warehouses at Exit 7A are silent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of all the commercial real estate markets in the region to get clobbered by the global economic downturn, few are hurting as bad as the Robbinsville area, just off Exit 7A of the New Jersey Turnpike. In the boom years, developers added millions of square feet of modern warehouse space here, anticipating demand from companies trying to design a more efficient supply chain. That demand evaporated when the recession hit, putting the 7A area in the epicenter of the state's warehouse bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We thought it was an appropriate time to build a building for clients who didn't have time to wait for a building to be built," says Alec Taylor of Matrix Development Group, which built several warehouses near Exit 7A in recent years that are now empty. "In retrospect, obviously, the story was a mistake."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly half -- 48% -- of the 7.2 million square feet of warehouse space near Exit 7A is vacant, according to real-estate data firm <span class="companylink">CoStar Group Inc</span>. The space has been on the market for an average of three years, CoStar says. David Knee, a <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> broker who is trying to lease some of that space, says rents in the area have dropped as much as 40% from their highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of its seaports and highway, rail, and air connections, New Jersey is where many businesses store their goods for distribution across the East Coast. The state has some 806 million square feet of warehouse space, according to <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group Inc</span>., enough to cover 14,000 football fields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1990s, as the economy expanded, developers envisioned a pickup in demand for bigger warehouses from national retailers hoping to improve efficiency with the latest in warehouse design and inventory tracking technology. With the sites closest to the ports taken, real-estate developers moved south on the Turnpike in search of cheap land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exit 7A, 60 miles by highway from Manhattan and 45 miles from the Port of Newark, was at the vanguard of that expansion. The surrounding farmland offered plenty of room for cheap growth for developers who added roughly 5 million square feet since 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were always scared of it," Emanuel Stern, president of Hartz Mountain Industries, which owns 25 million square feet of warehouse space in Northern New Jersey, said of the Exit 7A area. "There's no barrier to entry -- all you have to do is buy the next farmer's fields."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it turned out, the hoped for demand has been slow to materialize. Tenants in central New Jersey signed 5,290,213 square feet in new leases in the first half of this year, compared with 3.5 million the same period last year and 7.3 million the first half of 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matrix, a closely held developer based in based Cranbury, N.J., pioneered Exit 7A as an industrial market, building several warehouses in the 1990s for tenants like McLean Engineering and <span class="companylink">Amway Global</span>. Then, in the mid-2000s, Matrix saw so much demand that it tried building on speculation and scored lucrative deals with <span class="companylink">Colgate-Palmolive Co</span>. and Eastern Bag and Paper Co.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That success helped attract bigger players to the Exit 7A area. In 2007, private-equity fund KTR Capital Partners sold a newly built 905,000 square-foot warehouse to <span class="companylink">Principal Global Investors</span> for $58 million. Matrix built an 800,000 square-foot warehouse across the street in partnership with the <span class="companylink">California Public Employees Retirement System</span>, the nation's biggest pension fund. Both buildings are still empty and Principal says it's continuing to seek tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in 2008, furniture giant <span class="companylink">Levitz Furniture</span> filed for bankruptcy protection and vacated a million-square-foot warehouse nearby that a unit of <span class="companylink">Prudential Financial Inc</span>. had bought from Matrix for $72 million in 2006. Two smaller tenants are now occupying some of the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, brokers and landlords in central New Jersey are trying to figure out where all those once-promising tenants went. While shipments at the Port of New York and New Jersey are up more than 10% so far in 2010, areas closer to the Port are the first to see an improvement. The area around Exit 7A is still struggling. Part of the problem is that even as the economy recovers, consumer spending is lagging behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Central New Jersey is a consumer-driven market, so that's why it hasn't come back," said Bob Savage, president of KTR Capital Partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exit 8A, 15 miles to the north, is a more established industrial market, but there, too, things aren't looking good -- 17.6% of the 64 million square feet of warehouse space is available, according to <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, banks haven't been eager to take back properties that have been sitting empty, brokers and landlords say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But lenders are getting nervous, says Mitchell Katz, an industrial broker in New Jersey for Newmark Knight Frank. "Now, to get a deal done, you've got to look to the lender for approval," Mr. Katz says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pickup in shipping has some hopeful that big tenants will return to the market. But because Exit 7A is on the fringe of New Jersey's industrial region, it could take years for the market there to stabilize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If one believes that the overall economy is in for a steady, unspectacular recovery, then those buildings will lease up slowly and unspectacularly over the next 12 to 18 months," Mr. Taylor of Matrix says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two recent studies show there's good news and bad news about your coming vacation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bad news first: Your vacation will likely make you happier and probably even healthier, but those effects won't last long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the good: The benefits of your vacation kick in sooner than you'd think. In fact, if you have a trip planned, you're likely already happier than usual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite vacations being a sizable contributor to the world economy—Americans alone will spend $76 billion on summer vacations this year, up $7 billion from last year, according to a survey by travel insurer <span class="companylink">Mondial Assistance</span> USA—there's relatively little research available that measures vacation effects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a study published in the August issue of Work &amp; Stress, an academic journal, authors surveyed 96 Dutch workers over a seven-week period beginning two weeks before their planned vacations. Workers were asked throughout the period about wellness factors, including their health status, mood, level of tension and energy and satisfaction. Participants reported improvements in each of these measures during their vacations, as expected. However, just one week after returning to work, their self-reported measures of wellness plummeted to pre-vacation levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That suggests the benefits of vacations are real but short-lived. What the study results don't show, and what the authors suggest future studies look at, is how changes in vacation time affect the duration of benefits upon return. For example, if a worker has 10 vacation days to use during summer, does he capture greater total happiness by using them all at once on an extended getaway, or by taking Fridays off all summer long?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another study, published in the March issue of Applied Research in Quality of Life, looked at survey results from more than 1,500 Netherlanders, almost 1,000 of whom had gone on vacations. Time off refreshed workers, but the effects were far from lasting. The study also showed a marked increase in the self-reported happiness of vacationers in the weeks leading up to their trips.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The implications for workers are clear. Plan vacations well in advance. Doing so can save money, but more important, it prolongs the anticipatory phase and increases total happiness. How best to handle the dip in happiness upon returning to work? Simple: Start planning your next vacation right away.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Vacant Homes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More troubling news for the nation's housing market: Vacancy rates for both for-sale homes and rental units hardly moved in the second quarter from a year ago, according to the Census Bureau's residential vacancies report released last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data are just the latest to show that home vacancies remain high despite low interest rates and federal tax credits designed to spur home sales. The 2.5% homeowner vacancy rate—which is the share of homes that are vacant and up for sale—was down from 2.8% in the second quarters of 2009 and 2008, but is still high by historical standards. The homeowner vacancy rate bobbed between 1.5% and 1.8% from 1996 to 2005—the final year of the real-estate boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also signs that vacancies are set to grow through the end of the year as foreclosures continue and new-home sales sit at levels not seen for 47 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also showed the rental vacancy rate was 10.6% in the second quarter, flat from a year ago. The latest figure is the highest since the Commerce Department began tracking the data in 1965.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do Kids Need a Windfall?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The single largest concern and obsession of many people, especially wealthy ones, is how to leave money to their children. How much is too much? How can they be prepared?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yu Pengnian, a Chinese real-estate tycoon, has some wise words for Americans pondering their children's windfall. Mr. Yu, who announced in April that he is giving away the last $500 million of his fortune to his charitable foundation, was asked whether his children are angry about the donations. He said "they didn't oppose this idea, at least not in public."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet his greatest pearl of wisdom came when asked the question again recently by the Globe &amp; Mail. This time, he responded:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If my children are competent, they don't need my money. If they're not, leaving them a lot of money is only doing them harm."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Put another way, leaving your children tons of money is like telling them you don't think they can make it on their own. Too many parents focus on preventing their children from failing. But in doing so, they also deprive their kids of the joys of self-made success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea is all the more remarkable coming from a Chinese tycoon. In Asia, wealth is dynastic, and businesses are created to be passed down through the generations. The 88-year-old Mr. Yu is helping to shatter the traditions of inheritance. He says he is passionate about philanthropy because of his own poor upbringing. He started out as a street hawker in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everybody has a different view of money," he told the Globe &amp; Mail. "Some do good things with it, some rich people do nothing with it....My goal is to be a leader, a pioneer who encourages rich people, inside and outside of China, to do something charitable."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phil McGraw, better known as Dr. Phil, has bought an estate in Beverly Hills, Calif., for $29.5 million. Earlier this month, he listed his Beverly Hills home for $16.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate he purchased, which was unlisted, is a Mediterranean-style villa on three acres that has a 14,000-square-foot main house with five bedrooms and 11 bathrooms. There's also a guesthouse and a pool. The house has sweeping views of Century City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McGraw's current home is also a Mediterranean-style house on just under an acre. It has eight bedrooms and seven bathrooms as well as an in-home theater, gym, billiard room and an outdoor dining room. The property is walled and gated and has a two-bedroom detached guest house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known for his syndicated, daily advice talk show, Mr. McGraw first rose to fame when he appeared regularly on the "The Oprah Winfrey Show" in the late 1990s. He has also written several best-selling books. Through a representative, he declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jana Jones-Duffy and Fred Holley of Coldwell Banker Previews International represented the home Mr. McGraw purchased. Billy Dolan, a broker with Hilton &amp; Hyland in Los Angeles, has Mr. McGraw's listing for the $16.5 million property that's currently on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forbes Wyoming Ranch Goes On the Market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A ranch owned by the family of Malcolm Forbes, the late chairman and editor in chief of Forbes magazine, has hit the market in Jackson Hole, Wyo., for $12 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 85-acre ranch sits along the Snake River and borders Teton National Park. A 4,100-square-foot main lodge has a two-story great room, two kitchens, five bedrooms and four bathrooms. There are also six guest cabins and caretaker's quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Malcolm and Roberta Forbes purchased a roughly 150-acre ranch in 1979. Mr. Forbes died in 1990 and Ms. Forbes in 1992. The 85 acres that are for sale are owned by Moira Mumma, their daughter. Ms. Mumma's brother Tim Forbes still owns his portion of the family's ranch, which is adjacent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Viehman, a co-owner of Jackson Hole Real Estate Associates, a Christie Great Estates affiliate, has the listing. He said Ms. Mumma and her husband are selling because they no longer use it enough to justify keeping it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kauai Property on the Block</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate investor Michele Hughes will auction off a seven-acre oceanfront estate on Kauai's Anini Beach next month. Also available is her 40-acre unlisted beachfront property in Kauai's Kilauea for $40 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The auction includes a property with a three-bedroom main home on 1.3 acres overlooking the ocean. It was previously listed for $9.8 million.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daryl Hall, the singer, musician and songwriter best known as half of the pop duo Hall &amp;Oates, is now offering to sell part of his Dutchess County estate for about half the price he originally sought for the entire property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 248-acre estate, about 100 miles north of New York City, originally listed for $16 million last year. Then in May, the price was reduced to $11.9 million, with an option to buy the main house, three guesthouses and just 114 acres for $9.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, buyers can purchase the main house, guesthouses and 114 acres for $7.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Graham Klemm, a broker with Klemm Real Estate who has the listing, says that Mr. Hall plans to either sell the remaining acres to whomever buys the main estate, keep it or possibly donate it to a land trust. Mr. Hall declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hall has created something of a side career restoring historic homes. He began purchasing the land in the Dutchess County estate, which is known as Flint Hill, about 10 years ago. Over the next few years he worked with antique dealers, contractors and historians to build a 24-room manor house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doing so required dismantling and moving two separate 18th-century houses, originally located several miles from each other near Hartford, Conn., and reassembling them into one structure on the Dutchess County property, which is in the town of North East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is a home made with period artifacts and details, including wood-beam floors finished without modern gloss. There are also modern amenities like an indoor swimming pool and a gourmet kitchen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, Mr. Hall said in The Wall Street Journal that he was selling the property because he wanted to focus on other restoration projects.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TORONTO -- The euro advanced modestly on the dollar and yen, pinned between the results of the European bank stress tests and the next round of U.S. economic data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The safe-haven dollar weakened against the euro, the U.K. pound and the yen, with the market largely interpreting the results of the European bank stress tests as a positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The greenback was little moved as U.S. new-home sales for June beat expectations, a rise of 24% against the 3.7% rise economists predicted. The report follows a big downward revision to the prior month's record low, but still represents the second-lowest pace of new home sales since records began in 1963, said RBC Economics Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The June data don't allay concerns about how the U.S. economy will perform in the second half of this year, said Ron Leven, currency strategist at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> in New York. "We need more data," Mr. Leven said. "There is a growing uncertainty about the U.S. economy. There is a growing uncertainty about whether Europe is recovering. Compounding it is that positioning is very light and people's willingness to take risks is very low. And this may last awhile."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By early afternoon in New York, the euro was at $1.2997, compared with $1.2916 late Friday. The dollar moved to 86.93 yen from 87.37 yen. The euro strengthened to 112.98 yen from 111.84 yen. The pound strengthened to $1.5487 from $1.5423. The dollar moved to 1.0479 Swiss francs from 1.0534 francs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. has begun a relatively heavy data week, with consumer condidence and the Case-Shiller house prices due Tuesday, durable goods and the Federal Reserve's Beige Book coming Wednesday, and second-quarter gross domestic product, Chicago PMI and final University of Michigan-Reuters consumer confidence set for Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said last week the economy is headed for a period of "unusual uncertainty."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home buying surged in June after a May plunge caused by the end of a government tax credit, according to a better-than-expected report on the ailing housing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales increased 23.6% from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 330,000, the Commerce Department said Monday. Inventories fell, a hopeful sign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the sales level was the second lowest on record since 1963, the unexpectedly strong increase offered a glimmer of hope about a sector stuck in the doldrums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joblessness in the U.S. continues to restrain big purchases, despite low mortgage rates. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had estimated sales would climb in June by 3.7% to 311,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May sales fell 36.7% to a record 267,000, revised down from an originally reported 32.7% plunge to 300,000. The sharp drop followed buyers rushing to the market before the tax credit ended April 30, causing sales to soar in the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year-over-year, sales in June were down 16.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for a new home declined, year-over-year, in June by 0.6%, to $213,400 from $214,700 in June 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices could fall more if the supply of unsold homes keeps rising. A steady decline in prices can hurt sales. Would-be buyers will wait for a better deal and some owners will keep their property off the market until prices rise. Also, lower home values tend to make owners fell less wealthy, undercutting the desire to spend money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the data Monday showed inventories of new homes fell, dropping by 1.4% in June to an estimated 210,000 homes for sale, from 213,000 at the end of May. The months' supply at the current sales rate dropped to 7.6 from 9.6 in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, new-home sales increased 20.5% in the Midwest, 33.1% in the South and 46.4% in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales fell 6.6% in the West.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes slid in June for a second consecutive month as the effects of a government tax credit program continued to wane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales fell by 5.1% to an annual rate of 5.37 million, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Meanwhile, inventories rose and prices remained fairly stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the number of U.S. workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week by more than expected, reversing declines posted the prior week and signaling there is still little improvement in job market conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires were expecting sales to drop by 8.1% to an annual rate of 5.20 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes in May were unrevised at 5.66 million, the Realtors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year-over-year, existing home sales were up 9.8% in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially, the government's tax credit program, which provided tax credits of up to $8,000 for homebuyers, was expected to lift sales in May and June. The credits required deals to be signed by April 30 and closings to occur by Sept. 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Closings originally were to happen by June's end but Congress pushed back that deadline to accommodate for the increased level of distressed sales which take longer to complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's data provides more evidence that the economic recovery is slowing and that the housing market is struggling without government support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Federal Reserve officials scaled back their forecasts for U.S. growth for the first time in more than a year, saying a soft job market will restrain the economy's progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's data shows sales slowed across all regions in the U.S. except for the Northeast. Sales in the Northeast were up 7.9%. But in the South, sales fell 6.5%. In the West they plunged 9.3%, and in the Midwest they dipped by 7.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of an existing home in June stood at $183,700. Inventory levels in June rose 2.5% to 3.99 million, an 8.9 month supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That 8.9 figure is expected to move even higher in the coming months, NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said. If sustained, that could lead to a drop in home prices, which have largely stabilized over the past year. "Pending contracts suggest that in the upcoming months inventories will surpass 10 months," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should inventories hold at that level for more than three months, prices could move downward, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jobless Claims Increase</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its weekly report Thursday, the Labor Department said the number of U.S. workers filing initial claims for jobless benefits increased by 37,000 to 464,000 in the week ended July 17. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected claims would rise by 21,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disappointing report comes just one day after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told lawmakers that the U.S. economic outlook was "somewhat weaker," although he signaled there are no immediate plans for a shift in the Fed's policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The previous week's level of claims was revised only slightly downward, from 429,000 to 427,000. The four-week moving average -- which aims to give a better idea of the trend by smoothing volatility in the data -- went up by 1,250 to 456,000 in the week ended July 17. The prior week's average was revised to 454,750.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Claims lasting more than one week, meanwhile, dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts widely expected the latest claims data to reverse the decline for the week ended July 10, which was due largely to distortions in the seasonal factors. Normally in July claims tend to rise as factories shut down for part of the summer for annual retooling. But this year, <span class="companylink">General Motors Co</span>. decided to keep most of its plants operating, and Labor Department economists said manufacturers in other industries also broke from the tradition as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Labor Department economist said this latest rebound in claims is also partly because the prior week's data included the July 4 holiday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The failure of claims to show any dramatic reductions this year have left economists concerned about the pace of the labor market recovery. Millions remain out of work, and the unemployment rate stands at 9.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over 2 million people have been stuck without any jobless benefits after Congress let the federal extended-unemployment benefit program expire amid clashes between Democrats and Republicans over how to pay for it. But this week, Democrats managed to overcome Republican opposition and the Senate approved the extension Wednesday evening in a 59-39 vote. The legislation must now be taken up by the House before the president can sign it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Labor Department's report Thursday, the number of applicants filing for federal extended unemployment benefits dropped by 404,049 between June 26 and July 3. The big decline was largely a result of the congressional delay in approving the program's extension.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Labor Department's report Thursday, the number of continuing claims -- those drawn by workers for more than one week in the week ended July 10 -- declined by 223,000 to 4,487,000 from the preceding week's revised level of 4,710,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unemployment rate for workers with unemployment insurance for the week ended July 10 was 3.5%, a 0.2 percentage point decline from the prior week's unrevised rate of 3.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest increase in claims occurred in New York, which saw claims rise by 18,047 in the week ended July 10 due to layoffs in the transportation, service and public administration industries. Other states with large increases included Indiana, Michigan, Georgia and Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest decrease in claims for the week ended July 10 occurred in New Jersey, which saw claims fall by 10,585 due to fewer layoffs in the transportation, warehousing and service industries. Other states with large decreases included California, Massachusetts, Illinois and Oregon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leading Indicators Decline</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index of leading economic indicators fell in June, but the decline was less than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The leading index fell 0.2% in June, after rising a revised 0.5% in May, that had first been reported as a 0.4% gain, the Conference Board said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected an drop of 0.3% in the June index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The indicators point to slower growth through the fall," said Ken Goldstein, economist at the board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He pointed to two reasons for the slowdown. First, industrial output will slow as inventory rebuilding eases. Second, Goldstein said the service sector has been slow to improve, with little indication that it will pick up momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, five of the 10 leading indicators increased, four fell, and new orders for nondefense capital goods held steady.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most positive indicators were the interest rate spread and real money supply. The most negative contributors were average weekly factory hours and supplier deliveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coincident index was unchanged in June after rising a revised 0.5% in May that was first reported as a 0.4% gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lagging index rose 0.1% last month after falling an unrevised 0.1% in May.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos   </div><div>771 words</div><div>23 July 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes declined in June while the inventory of unsold homes rose, a combination that doesn't bode well for prices in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its monthly report on home-sale transactions on Thursday, the National Association of Realtors said sales were running at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 5.37 million last month, down 5.1% from May but up 9.8% from one year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales surged in the spring as buyers rushed to take advantage of tax credits worth as much as $8,000. To qualify, buyers had to sign purchase contracts by April 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales fell in most parts of the country in June except in the Northeast, where they rose 7.9% from May. Existing-home sales were down by 9.3% in the West, the largest regional drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' data for June reflect completions of sales, most of which were based on contracts signed in April and May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newly signed contracts plunged by 30% in May from the previous month, when the tax credit expired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given that, you are going to see a huge drop in closed sales in July, and it's going to continue at a minimum until August," said Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist in Leesburg, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of unsold homes rose by 2.5% in June to 3.99 million. That is 8.9 months' supply at the current sales pace, up from 8.3 months in May and the highest level since August 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in the inventory of unsold homes was particularly disappointing because the tax credits had been designed to help clear through the glut of unsold homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been adding more inventory than we've been selling... That's a worrisome sign in a month when we were paying people to buy homes," said Stan Humphries, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>, a real-estate website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A national survey of real-estate agents showed that traffic at homes for sale was lower in July than at any time since <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> began its survey in 2005, following big declines in May and June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, "rising inventory is going to make everything much worse," said John Burns, a housing consultant based in Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories are expected to grow in the coming months as banks process more foreclosures, which have been held off the market as banks work to complete government-mandated loan modifications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher levels of unsold homes renew the prospect that home prices will fall during the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Excess inventories are the mortal enemies of prices. Inventories go up and prices have got to go down," said Gary Shilling, president of A. Gary Shilling &amp; Co., an economic-consulting and financial-advisory firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unsold homes are also growing as signs of home-price stabilization in some markets have encouraged homeowners to test the market. Karen Wiese moved into her current home in Fair Oaks, Calif., five years ago after she and her husband, a homebuilder, decided to live in it rather than sell for less than the $1.1 million asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, she listed the six-bedroom home for $639,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't even know if we'll get a looker," she said. Ms. Wiese, 59, is building a smaller home on an adjacent lot and said she wants to downsize because her husband died last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One bright spot: falling mortgage rates, which continue to serve as one strong tailwind for the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was quoted at 4.56% this week, according to a weekly survey released by <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> on Thursday. The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.03%. Both are the lowest since Freddie began its survey in 1971.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, the prospect of weak demand has prompted housing economists to taking a dimmer outlook of the housing market, according to a monthly survey released on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 60% of the 109 economists and other analysts surveyed by MacroMarkets LLC expect home prices to decline this year, up from 40% in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> said its monthly house-price index in May was up 0.5% on a seasonally adjusted basis from April. The index is up 1.6% over the last three months, but down 1.2% from a year earlier.</p>

</div><div class="author">By                     Juliet Chung   </div><div>605 words</div><div>23 July 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Chesapeake Energy Corp</span>. Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon, a noted wine collector and part-owner of the NBA's Oklahoma City Thunder, plans to auction off his roughly 4,400-acre ranch in Antlers, Okla. The ranch is the smallest of the three he owns in the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 51-year-old Mr. McClendon bought the land in pieces in 2006 and 2007. He says he's selling because he infrequently visits the property, which is farther from his Oklahoma City base than his other ranches. "It's time to start simplifying," he says. A 410-acre working cattle ranch in nearby Hugo sold in March for $615,000, according to Barry Taylor of Coldwell Banker Taylor Real Estate in Antlers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "271 Ranch" is in the Kiamichi Valley, less than 200 miles from Oklahoma City and Dallas. The property is known as a prime site for hunting deer and is also a working cattle ranch supporting 1,400 head. There are pastures, lakes and more than a dozen structures, including a manager's home. About 1,100 acres have no reserve and will be sold to the highest bidder. Mr. McClendon can accept or refuse any bid on the remaining acreage, which will be auctioned off in pieces. National Auction Group has set the auction for Aug. 5 on the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don King Withdraws Listing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boxing promoter Don King has taken his nearly three-acre oceanfront estate in Manalapan, Fla., off the market. Its two homes were listed in early 2009 for $13.75 million each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. King bought the nine-bedroom main house of nearly 18,000 square feet for $7.8 million in 1999. The same year he paid $6.5 million for the roughly 9,000-square-foot guest house, which has five bedrooms and an ice-cream parlor. There's a replica of the Statue of Liberty in the backyard.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes declined in June as the inventory of unsold homes rose, a combination that doesn't bode well for prices in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its monthly report on home-sale transactions Thursday, the National Association of Realtors said sales were running at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 5.37 million last month, down 5.1% from May but up 9.8% from one year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales surged in the spring as buyers rushed to take advantage of tax credits worth as much as $8,000. To qualify, buyers had to sign purchase contracts by April 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales fell in most parts of the country in June except in the Northeast, where they rose 7.9% from May. Existing-home sales were down by 9.3% in the West, the largest regional drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' data for June reflect completions of sales, most of which were based on contracts signed in April and May. Newly signed contracts plunged by 30% in May from the previous month, when the tax credit expired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given that, you are going to see a huge drop in closed sales in July, and it's going to continue at a minimum until August," said Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist in Leesburg, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of unsold homes rose by 2.5% in June to 3.99 million. That is 8.9 months' supply at the current sales pace, the highest level since August 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in the inventory of unsold homes was particularly disappointing because the tax credits had been designed to help clear through the glut of unsold homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A national survey of real-estate agents showed that traffic at homes for sale was lower in July than at any time since <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> began its survey in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Rising inventory is going to make everything much worse," said John Burns, a housing consultant based in Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories are expected to grow in the coming months as banks process more foreclosures, which have been held off the market as banks work to complete government-mandated loan modifications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher levels of unsold homes renew the prospect that home prices will fall during the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Excess inventories are the mortal enemies of prices," said Gary Shilling, president of A. Gary Shilling &amp;Co., an economic-consulting and financial-advisory firm. "Inventories go up and prices have got to go down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unsold homes are also growing as signs of home-price stabilization in some markets have encouraged homeowners to test the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One bright spot: falling mortgage rates, which continue to serve as one strong tailwind for the market. The average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was quoted at 4.56% this week, according to a weekly survey released by <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> on Thursday. The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.03%. Both are the lowest since Freddie began its survey in 1971.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, the prospect of weak demand has prompted housing economists to taking a dimmer outlook of the housing market, according to a monthly survey released Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 60% of the 109 economists and other analysts surveyed by MacroMarkets LLC expect home prices to decline this year, up from 40% in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> said its monthly house-price index in May was up 0.5% on a seasonally adjusted basis from April. The index is up 1.6% over the last three months but down 1.2% from a year earlier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chesapeake CEO McClendon</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sets Ranch Auction</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Chesapeake Energy Corp</span>. Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon, a noted wine collector and part-owner of the NBA's Oklahoma City Thunder, plans to auction off his roughly 4,400-acre ranch in Antlers, Okla. The ranch is the smallest of the three he owns in the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 51-year-old Mr. McClendon bought the land in pieces in 2006 and 2007. He says he's selling because he infrequently visits the property, which is farther from his Oklahoma City base than his other ranches. "It's time to start simplifying," he says. A 410-acre working cattle ranch in nearby Hugo sold in March for $615,000, according to Barry Taylor of Coldwell Banker Taylor Real Estate in Antlers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "271 Ranch" is in the Kiamichi Valley, less than 200 miles from Oklahoma City and Dallas. The property is known as a prime site for hunting deer and is also a working cattle ranch supporting 1,400 head. There are pastures, lakes and more than a dozen structures, including a manager's home. About 1,100 acres have no reserve and will be sold to the highest bidder. Mr. McClendon can accept or refuse any bid on the remaining acreage, which will be auctioned off in pieces. National Auction Group has set the auction for Aug. 5 on the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don King Withdraws Listing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boxing promoter Don King has taken his nearly three-acre oceanfront estate in Manalapan, Fla., off the market. Its two homes were listed in early 2009 for $13.75 million each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. King bought the nine-bedroom main house of nearly 18,000 square feet for $7.8 million in 1999. The same year he paid $6.5 million for the roughly 9,000-square-foot guest house, which has five bedrooms and an ice-cream parlor. There's a replica of the Statue of Liberty in the backyard. The gated estate, about 10 miles south of West Palm Beach, includes two pools, a goldfish pond and a retractable staircase that leads to the beach. Each house has 150 feet of ocean frontage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 78-year-old Mr. King, whose clients have included Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson and Felix "Tito" Trinidad, says of the estate, "It's too much room for me and my wife." He says he took the houses off the market because he kept receiving low-ball offers and adds that he's still willing to consider offers. "Then I could get into more humble digs," he says.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in the Hamptons and the North Fork of Long Island jumped in the second quarter, the latest sign that New Yorker's favorite vacation-home market continues to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes sold in the region reached 582 in the second quarter, up 19.8% from the first quarter and 89.6% from the second quarter a year ago, according to a new report by Prudential Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel Inc. Prices up 14% from a year earlier, it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Brennan, regional manager for Prudential Douglas Elliman, said some added sales came from homes and condominiums with less-expensive prices. He said in a market such as Southampton, where homes are less expensive, homeowners are in more financial distress and are opting to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first quarter this year, Chief Executive Jonathan Miller of Miller Samuel said that there was an unusually high number of sales in the luxury market. In the second quarter, there was more of a normal sales mix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report data included are for closed sales, meaning that buyers signed contracts with sellers months ago. They don't reflect sales trends in recent weeks.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market, whose collapse pulled the economy into recession in late 2007, is stalling again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In major markets across the country, home sales are deteriorating, inventories of unsold homes are piling up and builders are scaling back construction plans. The expiration of a federal home-buyers tax credit at the end of April is weighing on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the U.S. Census Bureau said single-family housing starts in June fell by 0.7%, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 454,000. The U.S. started 1.47 million homes in 2006, before the housing bubble popped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Future construction looks even weaker. Permits for single-family starts fell 3% in June, following big declines in both May and April. "We're hovering at post-World War II lows," said Ivy Zelman, president of Zelman &amp;Associates, a research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists aren't singling out one reason for the stalling housing market. A variety of factors have led to flagging confidence, they say, including sluggish labor markets, global economic turmoil and falling stock prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the housing downturn dragged the economy into a recession nearly three years ago, now it is the economy that is pulling down housing, says economist Patrick Newport at IHS Global Insight. Without sustained job growth, the housing market likely won't improve. That in turn will ricochet across manufacturing, retail and other trades heavily dependent on home building and consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal's quarterly survey of housing-market conditions in 28 major metropolitan areas shows that inventory levels have grown in many markets. But inventory fell in some of the weakest ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of June, inventory was up 33% from year-ago levels in San Diego, and by 19% and 15% in Los Angeles and Orange County, Calif., respectively, according to data compiled by John Burns Real Estate Consulting. Rising inventory can lead to price declines later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even falling interest rates aren't enough to whet consumer appetites for housing. Last week, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was quoted at 4.57%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the lowest since its survey began in 1971. But demand for home-purchase mortgages sits near 14-year lows, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, down 44% over the past two months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government last fall extended tax credits worth up to $8,000 to home buyers who signed contracts by April 30, causing sales to surge early this year. Those buyers had until June 30 to close their sales until Congress, concerned that the backlog of sales wouldn't close in time, extended the deadline through September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts long expected the withdrawal of a federal tax credit, which had juiced sales, to lead to a slower-than-usual summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's the magnitude that's been the issue,"" says Douglas Duncan, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>. "The drop-off in activity has surpassed expectations.""</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports should show that completed transactions of home sales held up through June. But newly signed contracts in May and June have plunged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, some housing markets show signs of healing. Home-sales activity in New York, Washington, D.C., and parts of California continue to improve. But other markets, including Tampa, Fla., and Chicago, face rising foreclosures and weak job growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market faces two big problems: too many homes and falling demand. More than seven million borrowers are 30 days or more past due on their mortgage payments or in some stage of foreclosure. Rising foreclosures will keep pressure on prices as banks put more homes on the market. Moreover, the pool of potential buyers remains constrained by the unprecedented number of homeowners who are underwater, or who owe more than their homes are worth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial-property sales in Europe still are rising, but the volume of investment is just a fraction of what was seen before the financial crisis as growth of property values slows and investors remain concerned about the global economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European commercial-property sales are up 80% in the second quarter from a year ago, but are less than a third of the levels seen at the peak of the market, according to the latest data on commercial-property investment from <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total amount of investment in commercial property in Europe, the Middle East and Africa rose to 23 billion euros ($29.77 billion) in the second quarter, "a modest 15% increase" from the first quarter of the year, according to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're in a period of steady, but not spectacular recovery," said Arthur de Haast, head of the international capital group at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of the year, commercial-property sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa should reach $130 billion, up 35% from 2009, predicts Mr. de Haast, compared with nearly $350 billion at the peak of the market in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the biggest deals in Europe this year have been in the London area. In the latest deal, the Metro Shopping Fund announced Tuesday that it had sold the N1 shopping center in London's Islington area for 112 million pounds ($170.6 million). The price represents an initial yield of 5.3% for the buyer, <span class="companylink">Henderson Global Investors</span>, for its German business Warbug-Henderson KAG, according to <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> analyst Harm Meijer, who described it as "a good deal for the sellers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, in May, Mohamed al Fayed, the Egyptian tycoon, sold London's legendary Harrods department store to Qatar Holding, the investment group owned by the Qatari royal family, for 1.5 billion euros. And this month, private-equity firm Carlyle Group LLC agreed to pay 671 million pounds for six landmark London buildings. The properties previously were part of the portfolio that secured the White Tower commercial mortgage-backed security, or CMBS. The CMBS was in default, and the properties were sold by special servicer <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United Kingdom accounted for 40% of commercial-property sales in the Europe-Mideast-Africa region in the second quarter, according to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. But the rise in valuations in London is slowing as investors remain cautious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial-property values in the U.K. fell 44% over a 25-month period to July 2009. Property values have rebounded 15% since then, but the pace of recovery is uneven. From August to the end of December, U.K. property values rose 8.6%, but growth has slowed to 5.8% this year, according to the latest data from <span class="companylink">Investment Property Databank</span>, a property-research group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've seen a noticeable change over the past few months, partly because property values stopped racing ahead," said Charles Walker, a senior fund manager at <span class="companylink">Legal &amp;General Group PLC</span>, a British insurer and asset manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the year progresses, <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> expects investors to focus on France, Germany, the Nordic countries and Poland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Investors see that the French and German economies are recovering," said Mr. de Haast. "The euro has fallen against sterling, and this adjustment of European economies is making the Continent more affordable for outside investors."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid uncertainty about the global economy, investors appear more cautious about investing in property. A report issued this week by Preqin, which tracks private-equity investment, shows that private-equity funds are finding it harder to raise money. In the second quarter of 2010, private-equity real-estate funds raised just $7.3 billion, the lowest amount raised in a quarter since the third quarter of 2004. The report also said many funds have failed to reach their targets, and it is taking longer for managers to close funds.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff Gans, a 45-year-old engineer from Baltimore who designs software for car manufacturers, has contemplated buying a house for more than a year. But concerns about job stability have kept him on the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even falling interest rates aren't enough to whet consumer appetites for housing. Last week, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was quoted at 4.57%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the lowest since its survey began in 1971. But demand for home-purchase mortgages sits near 14-year lows, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, down 44% over the past two months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government last fall extended tax credits worth up to $8,000 to home buyers who signed contracts by April 30, causing sales to surge early this year. Those buyers had until June 30 to close their sales until Congress, concerned that the backlog of sales wouldn't close in time, extended the deadline through September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts long expected the withdrawal of a federal tax credit, which had juiced sales, to lead to a slower-than-usual summer. "It's the magnitude that's been the issue," says Douglas Duncan, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>. "The drop-off in activity has surpassed expectations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports should show that completed transactions of home sales held up through June. But newly signed contracts in May and June have plunged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, some housing markets show signs of healing. Home-sales activity in New York, Washington, D.C., and parts of California continue to improve. But other markets, including Tampa, Fla., and Chicago, face rising foreclosures and weak job growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low mortgage rates and falling prices have made homes more affordable in many markets than at any time in the past decade. But those affordability gains have been offset for many buyers by tighter lending standards, particularly for "jumbo" loans that are too large for government backing. Banks are requiring down payments of 20% and more and strong credit scores because they must hold jumbo loans in their portfolios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More broadly, the housing market faces two big problems: too many homes and falling demand. More than seven million borrowers are 30 days or more past due on their mortgage payments or in some stage of foreclosure. Rising foreclosures will keep pressure on prices as banks put more homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, nearly 39,000 borrowers received government-backed loan modifications, but more than 90,000 borrowers fell out of the program, the Obama administration said on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the pool of potential buyers remains constrained by the unprecedented number of homeowners who are underwater, or who owe more than their homes are worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's making it particularly hard for traditional "trade up" homeowners like Maria Billis to pull the trigger on a home purchase. Ms. Billis can't sell her townhouse in Boynton Beach, Fla., because its value has fallen by a quarter. That puts it below the $160,000 that she owes the bank. The 31-year-old human resources consultant, who married last month and wants to start a family, found a half-dozen homes in her price range but doesn't want to sell her current home for less than the amount owed. She has considered buying the new home and renting the townhouse, but concedes, "It's a big risk."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage-finance giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> also are starting to push more repossessed homes onto the market. The companies owned 164,000 homes at the end of March, up 80% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason inventory is rising: "Unrealistic sellers have flooded the market" after reports of bidding wars and home-price increases earlier in the year, says Steven Thomas, president of Altera Real Estate, a brokerage in Orange County. The amount of time that homes there have sat on the market there has swelled to 3.78 months, up from 2.35 months in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The sellers think the market's coming back. They've tacked on an extra 5 to 10 to 15%. The buyers aren't going for it," says Jim Klinge, a real-estate agent in Carlsbad, Calif. Over the next six months, "it's going to feel like a double-dip because sellers are going to have to lower their prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all sellers will take that step. Jerry Anderson has listed his four-bedroom home in Dana Point, Calif., on and off the market for the last two years. He's cut the price to $1.25 million, down from $1.75 million, but hasn't had any offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Anderson, who bought the home in 1987, says he'll take it off the market in December if it doesn't sell rather than cut the price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matt Carney listed his Moreno Valley, Calif., home for $337,000 in February, and lowered the price on Tuesday for the third time, to $297,000. He says he can't go any lower because he owes $274,000 on the home and doesn't want to dip into savings to pay for transaction costs.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site of the city's first purpose-built indoor parking garage has been transformed into a loft-like rental building that will open in September with some of the highest asking rents in SoHo: One bed-room apartments will start at $6,500 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nine-story building of glass and cast concrete curves around the corner of Thompson and Broome streets, a few blocks from the entrance to the Holland Tunnel. The Tunnel Garage was built on the site in 1922 in anticipation of the flood of cars coming out of the tunnel from New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of wrangling with local preservationists and the city's Bureau of Standards and Appeals, the developer -- Manhattan Skyline, founded by Donald Zucker -- won permission to tear down the sprawling two-story garage and to put up an apartment building with 38 units and a large ground-floor retail space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartments, many with terraces or balconies, have 10-foot ceilings and large, open living rooms. Some units come with curved walls of glass, gas fireplaces, white oak floors and wrap around terraces. Even some bathrooms have windows with views of the Empire State Building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartments are unusually large for a rental building, with one-bedroom units measuring about 1,000 square and two-bedroom apartments about 1,500 square feet. Those dimensions are more common in new luxury condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asking rents will start at $12,000 a month for the 17 two-bedroom apartments, and at $18,000 for the two three-bedroom units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Cantor, a principal of Cantor Pecorella, which is marketing the apartments, said the new units will carry above-average rents because the nine-story building is unique and in keeping with "the low-rise European character of SoHo" compared with most new rentals found in large "cookie cutter" rental buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition for the new building, he said, would come from individual apartments listed as rentals by unit owners in new condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some signs of the parking garage remain. The curved glass facade of 55 Thompson echoes the curved facade of the old Tunnel Garage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A large terra cotta medallion showing a 1920s car emerging from a tunnel, its headlights blazing, was once perched atop the garage. Now it has been installed on the roof of new apartment building. After a restoration is completed, it will be illuminated at night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Esnard, a former deputy mayor who is working on the 55 Thompson St. project, said an architect for the developer had once appeared at a public meeting and promised to move the medallion to the lobby of the new building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when the medallion was taken down from the garage, it turned out to be 13 feet in diameter -- too large to fit in the lobby, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Work on the Holland Tunnel began in 1920, and was completed in 1927. A certificate of occupancy was issued for the Tunnel Garage in July 1923. Until then, most indoor car garages had been converted stables rather than purpose-built garages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years the terra cotta medallion was covered up with a sign reading "24 hr. Parking". Nevertheless, when the building was threatened with demolition, preservationists sought to give the facade landmark projection. But the developers argued that it was too badly damaged to save.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the site was zoned for commercial use, Manhattan Skyline was required to go to the Board of Standards and Appeals to get a variance to build apartments instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That set off an intricate negotiation. Although Manhattan Skyline said it had the right to put up a 14-story hotel, it agreed to nine stories instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also made other concessions to meet objections from next-door neighbors and community groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the deal, the developer agreed to build a three-story townhouse around the corner at Sullivan and Broome streets. The new townhouse, intended to complement nearby townhouses, will have a rear yard and will be available for rent as well. The asking rate hasn't been set yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Berman, executive director of the Greenwich Village Society of Historic Preservation, said that he regretted the demolition but was glad the medallion "has not been sent off to the landfill."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi </div><div>815 words</div><div>21 July 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some brokers were scratching their heads last week after <span class="companylink">Northrop Grumman Corp</span>. decided where in northern Virginia to locate its new headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The defense giant, which announced plans to move from Los Angeles earlier this year, decided to buy property rather than lease it, seen by some as an unusual move. Also, out of a multitude of possibilities in the current weak real-estate market, Northrop chose an older office building in Falls Church, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the thinking behind the company's strategy is emerging. For starters, Northrop, one of the world's largest defense contractors, looks to have gotten a pretty good deal. The <span class="companylink">ING Office Fund</span>, an Australian real-estate investment trust affiliated with <span class="companylink">ING Groep NV</span> of Amsterdam, will sell the 14-story building it partially owns to Northrop for at least $78.6 million but not more than the $105 million, an ING spokesman said. Some brokers expect the price to be as low as $90 million. The ING venture paid <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications</span> $105 million for the building in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northrop also took into consideration the low cost of borrowing money and proposed new accounting standards that could make it less advantageous to lease real estate. "Buying made sense, anyway; it just made more sense in light of the rules," says Gaston Kent, a vice president of finance with <span class="companylink">Northrop Grumman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Northrop Grumman</span>'s agreement to buy the building comes about six months after Wesley Bush -- who took over as the company's new chief executive on Jan. 1 and has visited the planned new headquarters -- announced the corporate offices would move to the Washington region to be closer to the company's customer base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Northrop Grumman</span> has California roots that can be traced back to 1939, when John Northrop set up shop in a Hawthorne, Calif., hotel. The headquarters' departure is a tough loss for Southern California, which is considered by many the aerospace industry's birthplace. Northrop plans to move some 300 executives to the new facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, the company zeroed in on Virginia and winnowed down its list of potential locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Falls Church property appealed to Northrop partly for its proximity to the Pentagon. That it was virtually ready to be occupied and had signs visible from the heavily trafficked Beltway played in its favor, Mr. Kent says. An incentive package of at least $16 million in grants and infrastructure improvements from the state and local governments also sweetened the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kent, who says Northrop will pay cash for the property and not assume any debt, declined to comment on the price or the value of the upgrades that Northrop will make to the building before it begins moving in next summer -- except to say that they won't be lavish. "It's not going to be the Taj Mahal," Mr. Kent says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the purchase of the building closes as expected next month, the deal also will be something of an about-face in terms of the company's approach to its corporate real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For roughly 20 years, the company's corporate headquarters have been in leased office space in a tower in the Century City section of Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed changes in accounting rules could be a factor in other corporate decisions. Under current standards, most companies show the cost of leasing their real estate as an expense but not as a liability, according to Mindy Berman, a managing director in Boston with <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, a real-estate-services company. The proposed standards that could go into effect as early as 2013 would require companies to show leases on their balance sheets as a liability, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some companies are concerned that change could reduce their borrowing capacity. The Real Estate Roundtable, a trade group, is concerned it will put more pressure on companies to sign shorter leases and reduce building owners' ability to obtain long-term leases that are often key to their financing strategies. While its full impact is unclear, Ms. Berman says the change on the horizon is increasingly forcing companies to examine their reasons for leasing versus owning real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, ING decided to sell partly because of the shifting commercial-real-estate landscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years ago, ING saw its acquisition of the soon-to-be vacant building in the Virginia office park as a "value-add" play, a scenario whereby investors generally aim to buy properties on the cheap and add value by making capital improvements or leasing them. But then the downturn hit, and that left few new tenants willing to lease space, let alone at higher rents. ING believes selling to Northrop will fetch more than trying to lease the property, according to a person familiar with the property.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos and Robbie Whelan   </div><div>1220 words</div><div>21 July 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market, whose collapse pulled the economy into recession in late 2007, is stalling again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In major markets across the country, home sales are deteriorating, inventories of unsold homes are piling up and builders are scaling back construction plans. The expiration of a federal home-buyers tax credit at the end of April is weighing on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the U.S. Census Bureau said single-family housing starts in June fell by 0.7%, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 454,000. The U.S. started 1.47 million homes in 2006, before the housing bubble popped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Future construction looks even weaker. Permits for single-family starts fell 3% in June, following big declines in both May and April. "We're hovering at post-World War II lows," said Ivy Zelman, president of Zelman &amp; Associates, a research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists aren't singling out one reason for the stalling housing market. A variety of factors have led to flagging confidence, they say, including sluggish labor markets, global economic turmoil and falling stock prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the housing downturn dragged the economy into a recession nearly three years ago, now it is the economy that is pulling down housing, says economist Patrick Newport at IHS Global Insight. Without sustained job growth, the housing market likely won't improve. That in turn will ricochet across manufacturing, retail and other trades heavily dependent on home building and consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal's quarterly survey of housing-market conditions in 28 major metropolitan areas shows that inventory levels have grown in many markets. But inventory fell in some of the weakest ones, including several Florida markets, Atlanta, and Charlotte, N.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of June, inventory was up 33% from year-ago levels in San Diego, and by 19% and 15% in Los Angeles and Orange County, Calif., respectively, according to data compiled by John Burns Real Estate Consulting. Rising inventory can lead to price declines later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff Gans, a 45-year-old engineer from Baltimore who designs software for car manufacturers, has contemplated buying a house or condo for more than a year. But concerns about job stability have kept him on the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even falling interest rates aren't enough to whet consumer appetites for housing. Last week, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was quoted at 4.57%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the lowest since its survey began in 1971. But demand for home-purchase mortgages sits near 14-year lows, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, down 44% over the past two months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government last fall extended tax credits worth up to $8,000 to home buyers who signed contracts by April 30, causing sales to surge early this year. Those buyers had until June 30 to close their sales until Congress, concerned that the backlog of sales wouldn't close in time, extended the deadline through September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts long expected the withdrawal of a federal tax credit, which had juiced sales, to lead to a slower-than-usual summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's the magnitude that's been the issue,'' says Douglas Duncan, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>. "The drop-off in activity has surpassed expectations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports should show that completed transactions of home sales held up through June. But newly signed contracts in May and June have plunged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, some housing markets show signs of healing. Home-sales activity in New York, Washington, D.C., and parts of California continue to improve. But other markets, including Tampa, Fla., and Chicago, face rising foreclosures and weak job growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low mortgage rates and falling prices have made homes more affordable in many markets than at any time in the past decade. But those affordability gains have been offset for many buyers by tighter lending standards, particularly for "jumbo" loans that are too large for government backing. Banks are requiring down payments of 20% and more and strong credit scores because they must hold jumbo loans in their portfolios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More broadly, the housing market faces two big problems: too many homes and falling demand. More than seven million borrowers are 30 days or more past due on their mortgage payments or in some stage of foreclosure. Rising foreclosures will keep pressure on prices as banks put more homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, nearly 39,000 borrowers received government-backed loan modifications, but more than 90,000 borrowers fell out of the program, the Obama administration said on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the pool of potential buyers remains constrained by the unprecedented number of homeowners who are underwater, or who owe more than their homes are worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's making it particularly hard for traditional "trade up" homeowners like Maria Billis to pull the trigger on a home purchase. Ms. Billis can't sell her townhouse in Boynton Beach, Fla., because its value has fallen by a quarter. That puts it below the $160,000 that she owes the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 31-year-old human resources consultant, who married last month and wants to start a family, found a half-dozen homes in her price range but doesn't want to sell her current home for less than the amount owed. She has considered buying the new home and renting the townhouse, but concedes, "It's a big risk."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage-finance giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> also are starting to push more repossessed homes onto the market. The companies owned 164,000 homes at the end of March, up 80% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason inventory is rising: "Unrealistic sellers have flooded the market" after reports of bidding wars and home-price increases earlier in the year, says Steven Thomas, president of Altera Real Estate, a brokerage in Orange County. The amount of time that homes there have sat on the market there has swelled to 3.78 months, up from 2.35 months in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The sellers think the market's coming back. They've tacked on an extra 5 to 10 to 15%. The buyers aren't going for it," says Jim Klinge, a real-estate agent in Carlsbad, Calif. Over the next six months, "it's going to feel like a double-dip because sellers are going to have to lower their prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all sellers will take that step. Jerry Anderson has listed his four-bedroom home in Dana Point, Calif., on and off the market for the last two years. He's cut the price to $1.25 million, down from $1.75 million, but hasn't had any offers on the home, which has three fireplaces and ocean views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Anderson, who bought the home in 1987, says he'll take it off the market in December if it doesn't sell rather than cut the price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matt Carney listed his Moreno Valley, Calif., home for $337,000 in February, and lowered the price on Tuesday for the third time, to $297,000. He says he can't go any lower because he owes $274,000 on the home and doesn't want to dip into savings to pay for transaction costs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some brokers were scratching their heads last week after <span class="companylink">Northrop Grumman Corp</span>. decided where in northern Virginia to locate its new headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The defense giant, which announced plans to move from Los Angeles earlier this year, decided to buy property rather than lease it, seen by some as an unusual move. Also, out of a multitude of possibilities in the current weak real-estate market, Northrop chose an older office building in Falls Church, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the thinking behind the company's strategy is emerging. For starters, Northrop, one of the world's largest defense contractors, looks to have gotten a pretty good deal. The <span class="companylink">ING Office Fund</span>, an Australian real-estate investment trust affiliated with <span class="companylink">ING Groep NV</span> of Amsterdam, will sell the 14-story building it partially owns to Northrop for at least $78.6 million but not more than the $105 million, an ING spokesman said. Some brokers expect the price to be as low as $90 million. The ING venture paid <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications</span> $105 million for the building in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northrop also took into consideration the low cost of borrowing money and proposed new accounting standards that could make it less advantageous to lease real estate. "Buying made sense, anyway; it just made more sense in light of the rules," says Gaston Kent, a vice president of finance with <span class="companylink">Northrop Grumman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Northrop Grumman</span>'s agreement to buy the building comes about six months after Wesley Bush—who took over as the company's new chief executive on Jan. 1 and has visited the planned new headquarters—announced the corporate offices would move to the Washington region to be closer to the company's customer base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Northrop Grumman</span> has California roots that can be traced back to 1939, when John Northrop set up shop in a Hawthorne, Calif., hotel. The headquarters' departure is a tough loss for Southern California, which is considered by many the aerospace industry's birthplace. Northrop plans to move some 300 executives to the new facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, the company zeroed in on Virginia and winnowed down its list of potential locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Falls Church property appealed to Northrop partly for its proximity to the Pentagon. That it was virtually ready to be occupied and had signs visible from the heavily trafficked Beltway played in its favor, Mr. Kent says. An incentive package of at least $16 million in grants and infrastructure improvements from the state and local governments also sweetened the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kent, who says Northrop will pay cash for the property and not assume any debt, declined to comment on the price or the value of the upgrades that Northrop will make to the building before it begins moving in next summer—except to say that they won't be lavish. "It's not going to be the Taj Mahal," Mr. Kent says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the purchase of the building closes as expected next month, the deal also will be something of an about-face in terms of the company's approach to its corporate real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For roughly 20 years, the company's corporate headquarters have been in leased office space in a tower in the Century City section of Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed changes in accounting rules could be a factor in other corporate decisions. Under current standards, most companies show the cost of leasing their real estate as an expense but not as a liability, according to Mindy Berman, a managing director in Boston with <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, a real-estate-services company. The proposed standards that could go into effect as early as 2013 would require companies to show leases on their balance sheets as a liability, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some companies are concerned that change could reduce their borrowing capacity. The Real Estate Roundtable, a trade group, is concerned it will put more pressure on companies to sign shorter leases and reduce building owners' ability to obtain long-term leases that are often key to their financing strategies. While its full impact is unclear, Ms. Berman says the change on the horizon is increasingly forcing companies to examine their reasons for leasing versus owning real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, ING decided to sell partly because of the shifting commercial-real-estate landscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years ago, ING saw its acquisition of the soon-to-be vacant building in the Virginia office park as a "value-add" play, a scenario whereby investors generally aim to buy properties on the cheap and add value by making capital improvements or leasing them. But then the downturn hit, and that left few new tenants willing to lease space, let alone at higher rents. ING believes selling to Northrop will fetch more than trying to lease the property, according to a person familiar with the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, ING paid just more than $300 a square foot. Though office values in Washington's suburbs have held up better than in many other parts of the country, the average prices paid per square foot have slipped from $311 in 2008 to just under $240 now, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a real-estate-research firm.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lingling Wei, Peter Lattman and Aaron Lucchetti </div><div>756 words</div><div>21 July 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>18</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After building one of the biggest, most prestigious real-estate-investing businesses on Wall Street, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> is weighing plans to scale it back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm is considering what to do with its family of funds known as Msref, according to people familiar with the matter. One option could be to reduce its own capital in the funds, while another could be to sell them, the people said. They emphasize that planning is in the early stages and no decisions have been made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're not in discussions on the sale of the business," a <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> spokeswoman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New regulations that would follow the passage of financial-services legislation in the U.S. would likely force <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> and other banks to cut their own investments in real-estate funds and some other portfolios they manage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any move by <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> to reduce its influence as a real-estate investor would reshape the industry's playing field. Started in the early 1990s and built up under <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s chairman and former chief executive, John Mack, Msref has long been considered among the most sophisticated of Wall Street real-estate investors. Its funds, with about $46 billion in assets, hold investments including a luxury resort in southern China, the European Central Bank's Frankfurt headquarters and a stake in one of Australia's biggest office landlords.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm was one of the most aggressive buyers of real estate during the boom, buying at least $53 billion of property and selling only $14 billion from 2005 to 2007, according to research firm <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. Now, some of those deals are coming back to haunt the firm as property values plunge, rent rolls erode and financing remains scarce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-equity firms looking to expand in this arena, including KKR, TPG, <span class="companylink">BlackRock Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Brookfield Asset Management</span>, are examining the firm's funds, according to the people with knowledge of the matter. Representatives at those firms declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many big property funds run by banks emerged from the wreckage of the real-estate downturn of the early 1990s. But now, they have either disappeared or are ailing because of losses tied to the investments they made during the go-go years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large bets on property were a primary cause of the collapse of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc</span>. <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>.'s real-estate investment unit also has suffered large losses in its funds, which are operated under the Whitehall brand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last year, new <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> CEO James Gorman tapped former <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch &amp;Co</span>. President Gregory Fleming to shake up the company's asset-management unit, which includes Msref. When times were good, the Msref real-estate funds proved lucrative for various segments of the bank. For an $8.8 billion Msref fund, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> in 2007 alone earned more than $196 million in assorted fees. But when the commercial-property bubble popped in 2008, that fund and some other top-of-the-market investments suffered, denting the firm's record as a real-estate investor. The ailing deals include its 2007 acquisitions of <span class="companylink">Crescent Real Estate Equities Co</span>. and five downtown office towers in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> told investors in the $8.8 billion real-estate fund that it may have accumulated losses since the fund's inception of nearly two-thirds of its money, according to the fund's report for the third quarter of 2009. The estimated $5.4 billion loss likely would be the biggest dollar loss in the history of private-equity real-estate investing. The firm in May closed a new $4.7 billion global real-estate fund amid a challenging fund-raising environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are incentives for <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> to hold on to the business, including management fees that are paid even if performance fees aren't earned. Msref may not fetch much should it sell now, given pressures that have weighed on the market. Also, while the financial-overhaul bill expected to be signed into law by President Barack Obama on Wednesday would require the bank to reduce its stakes in its real-estate funds, it would have as many as 12 years to do so since real estate is considered hard to sell. And <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> could continue to manage the funds even if it pared its stakes.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-sale activity in the Queens residential market continues to sizzle as buyers take advantage of lower prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the second quarter, the number of homes sold totaled 3,972, up 86.6% from the same period a year ago, according to data from Miller Samuel Inc., a real-estate appraisal firm. The surge in sales during the April-June period partly reflected buyers rushing to acquire homes before the April 30 expiration of a federal tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically low mortgage rates and improved affordability from falling prices were also a driver of sales. The average selling price of a home in Queens declined 3.6% to $382,518. By comparison, the average sales price in Manhattan was $1,432,712 and in Brooklyn was $545,110.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condominium sales totaled 920 in the quarter, more than four times sales a year earlier.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. builders held back their shovels and cut housing starts again in June, but a sign emerged of a turnaround in construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts dropped by 5.0%, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 549,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Single-family housing starts slipped 0.7% to an annual rate of 454,000. Apartment construction fell harder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits for new construction, however, rose, signaling a pickup down the road for builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 5.0% drop was more than forecast and brought starts to the lowest level since October 2009. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expected overall housing starts to fall by 3.2% to 574,000 during June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales collapsed by 33% in May, the latest data show. Buying dried up because of the end of a government tax credit. The unemployment rate remains high, and builders face competition from cheaper property in the used-home market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loss of the tax incentive knocked the industry for a loop. Builder <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> reported second-quarter orders tumbled 23%. With the back-to-back decreases, housing starts, year over year, were down 5.8% in June. The Commerce Department said May starts plunged 14.9%, instead of the initially estimated 10.0% decrease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing's struggle to recover is fighting weakness in the overall economy. Last week, the research firm <span class="companylink">Macroeconomic Advisers</span> slashed its forecast for second-quarter gross domestic product by 1.1 percentage points to a rather mediocre 2.1% growth rate. GDP is the broad measure of economic activity in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer sentiment as of mid-July ebbed to levels last seen in March 2009. A report Monday showed builder confidence in the housing market fell in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, in a sign of hope, Wednesday's report showed June building permits increased 2.1% to an annual rate of 586,000. Economists had expected permits would rise by 0.7% in June to a rate of 578,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May permits had fallen 5.9%, reaching an annual rate of 574,000. Building permits are a sign of future construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with the drop in single-family housing starts in June, apartment construction -- housing with two or more units -- dropped 21.5% to an annual rate of 95,000. Within that multi-family category, groundbreakings of homes with five or more units were down by 19.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, housing starts in June fell 2.4% in the South, 11.3% in the Northeast, 6.9% in the Midwest, and 5.9% in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said actual housing starts fell to 54,200 in June from 55,300 in May. Lumber and commodities markets watch those numbers closely to gauge demand.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>. sold its real-estate investment business to Leon Black's <span class="companylink">Apollo Global Management</span>, a deal that gives Apollo about $3.5 billion worth of properties world-wide to manage.

Dutch lender and insurer <span class="companylink">ING Groep NV</span> is also evaluating a potential sale of its real-estate investment unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moves come amid a real-estate bear market as well as pending regulation that discourages banks from investing their capital in risky assets.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bull markets, it is said, climb a wall of worry. Smart investors buy in early when worries about profits or inflation or wars scare away the faint of heart. Latecomers then bid up stocks as each worry becomes unfounded, until there is nothing left to worry about. Once there is only good news, the market peaks as no one is left to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bear markets, on the other hand, fall into what I like to call the pit of doom. Forget about worries -- actual bad stuff happens, until nothing bad is left to happen and the market bottoms as there is no one left to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From early May through last week, the U.S. market dropped 1500 points into the pit, on the backs of gushing BP oil, riots in Europe, and a 30% drop in pending home sales. But now we've seen 680 Dow points added over seven straight up days before a slight decline yesterday. What the heck is going on?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Call it the yo-yo market -- from the top of the wall to the bottom of the pit and back -- and you better get used to it. It's hard to tell which market moves are real and based on prospects for better profits, as opposed to moves that are driven by all the extraordinary government measures to prop up the world economy. Until a few things are resolved, you'd better learn the yo-yo sleeper trick -- that is, keep spinning at the bottom without going up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ZIRP: We live in abnormal times. The Fed is running what is essentially a zero interest rate policy, aka ZIRP. The stock market lacks a compass, a true north, to find its way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make things worse, the Fed's zero policy is wreaking havoc in the real world, not just on Wall Street. In most companies, projects are funded when expected returns are higher than the risk-free rate of return, i.e., investing in T-bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the risk-free rate today is a big fat zero! Every project makes sense, which can't possibly be right, so corporate planners sit on their hands and companies just sit on their piles of cash. The sooner we zip the ZIRP, the sooner we return to some sort of normal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crutches: We all know that the U.S. economy is being held up on crutches -- the biggest being the Fed printing dollars, a quantitative easing that saw the monetary base jump to $2 trillion today from $800 billion in September 2008. That program stopped March 31 and at some point has to reverse. May's 33% drop in home sales, despite record low mortgage rates, happened because an $8,000 tax credit expired at the end of April. Auto sales are down as "Cash for Clunkers" expired eight months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we still have the crutch of the remaining funds (about half) from the 2009 stimulus bill.

</div><div class="author">By Brittany Hutson </div><div>892 words</div><div>17 July 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A18</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, East Harlem was considered by many to be an unsafe and less than desirable community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the old East Harlem. The area, bordered by Fifth Avenue and the East River between East 96th and East 125th streets, has come alive lately thanks to new development and an influx of young families, professionals and college students who have been priced out of other areas of Manhattan. The main attraction: relatively inexpensive home prices, larger spaces and low rents. One bedrooms are around $1,700 a month, says Dianne Howard, associate broker for <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once they've arrived, folks embrace the diverse, vibrant community, its landscape dotted with community gardens that locals take pride in maintaining, as well as brightly colored murals depicting Latin culture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A blend of residents include Italians, French, Haitians, Dominicans, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Africans, Asian-Americans and Garifuna, an ethnic group with ancestry from Central America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is tremendous excitement because there is so much diversity in a place that once upon a time people did not want to live in," said Peggy Morales, a 30-year resident and community activist. "People want to become a part of the local community, give back to it and start families here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brownstones, townhomes, public housing and tenement buildings make up the majority of housing stock, although a number of cooperative apartments and condominiums have gone up in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scheduled for completion by the end of the year, the Embelesar 118, a co-op at East 118th Street will have studio, one-bedroom, two-bedroom and penthouse units ranging between $233,000 and $650,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The East River Plaza, a shopping plaza located off the FDR Drive between 116th and 119th streets opened in October, and is bringing a number of big-name retailers, including <span class="companylink">Costco</span>, <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span>, <span class="companylink">PetSmart</span> and Target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area is also home to part of Fifth Avenue's museum mile, including El Museo del Barrio, the Museum of the City of New York and the Museum for African Art, opening in early 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there are a number of social clubs, restaurants and cafes for the 21 and over crowd, the community lacks a movie theater or youth recreation facilities. "There is nothing for them to do here," said Ms. Morales. "We need a facility that will create jobs and stimulate these young people's minds so they can engage in activities that are productive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parks: Nearby are Marcus Garvey Park, Thomas Jefferson Park and the Conservatory Garden in Central Park. Popular community gardens include Los Amigos Garden, the 103rd Street Community Garden, the Target East Harlem Community Garden and Papo's Garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schools: Public schools fall within District 4 and 5, and include Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics, a high school with advanced science research and internship opportunities. Also, there is TAG Young Scholars which serves gifted students in kindergarten through eighth grade; and P.S. 096 Joseph Lanzetta, which offers the VH1 Instrumental Music Program and Upward Bound TASC after-school program. In District 4 in 2009, 76.5% of students received a proficient score on the math exam, and 64.4% of students received a proficient score on the English Language Arts exam. In 2006, the results were 48.6% for math and 41.4% for reading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dining: Long-time establishments include Patsy's, a pizzeria on 118th Street and First Avenue that opened in 1933; and Rao's, offering Neapolitan cuisine and known as one of the most difficult restaurants in New York in which to secure a reservation. For Spanish food, try Caridad restaurant; for Latin food, there's Ricardo's Steakhouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New establishments, particularly cafes, are gradually moving into the neighborhood, such as the two-year-old SpaHa Cafe and Creole Restaurant.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RHINEBECK, N.Y. -- Chelsea Clinton is not getting married here. At least, that's the word among some residents on the quaint streets of Rhinebeck, where the former first daughter and her fiance, Marc Mezvinsky, are expected to wed at the end of the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My wife thinks this is a decoy location, and the wedding will be held on Martha's Vineyard," says a Rhinebeck police officer, Steven Hanaburgh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Jim Reardon says he hasn't heard a peep from anyone associated with the nuptials. "I'm upset," Mr. Reardon said. "My biggest concern is traffic and emergency response, and I want to make sure this kind of stuff is secure."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the town has not received any official notification, according to Rhinebeck Councilman Dan Staley. A spokesman for the Clinton family declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most signs around this sleepy hamlet point to the orchestration of a lavish affair -- and a bump for the local economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Rhinebeck's streets and in its restaurants, nearly every conversation is peppered with people who speak of the Clintons more with a sense of familiarity than awe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At candy store Samuel's of Rhinebeck, employee John Traver rattled off a list of previous sightings, including the time he spotted former President Bill Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton holding hands outside the restaurant across the street when they dined there two years ago. The Clinton home in Chappaqua is about 75 miles away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The fact that they chose Rhinebeck says something about our rural community," Mr. Staley said. "People respect other people's space around here, for the most part."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wedding will be catered by a combination of Blue Ribbon Restaurants, St. Regis Hotels and Resorts and Olivier Cheng Catering and Events, according to a person familiar with the matter. Boston-based Winston Flowers, whose previous clients include Cartier, Gucci and Veuve Cliquot Champagne, will provide floral arrangements, as will floral designer Jeff Leatham. Mr. Leatham is the artistic director of the Four Seasons Hotel George V in Paris, according to his website, and his previous clients include Mr. Clinton and Madonna, as well as Eva Longoria and Tony Parker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for Blue Ribbon declined to comment. An office manager at Olivier Cheng, Jay Reed, said: "It's not us. We'd like that, but it's not true." Mr. Leatham's partner, Richard Gonzales, declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the St. Regis declined to comment. The owner of Winston Flowers could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least one element of the festivities will take advantage of the area's agricultural abundance. When guests reach Rhinebeck, a bottle of Phyllis Feder's wine will greet them upon arrival at their hotels. Not only does the former first family have longstanding ties to her vineyard, but they couldn't ask for a more apt brand to welcome friends: Clinton Vineyards. The local winery was selected to supply bottles of its "Tribute" vintage as part of a welcome package for guests attending the nuptials, according to Ms. Feder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It will be provided to them individually to welcome them," Ms. Feder said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wine will not be served at the wedding reception, according to Ms. Feder. The owner of Old Mill Wine &amp;Spirits, a liquor store in Rhinebeck's center that stocks Ms. Feder's wines, said he looks forward to a possible boost in business. "I guess I could stock up and hope people stop in to pick up a last-minute wedding gift," Charles Derbyshire said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rehearsal dinner will be held in a stone barn on a 525-acre estate called Grasmere, according to two people with knowledge of the events. Six months ago, the couple who rents the mansion on the property received a request to vacate their residence during the end of July, according to an acquaintance of the couple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owner of the estate, architect Steve Mensch, said he is developing the property into a spa and hotel. "We've used it for local fund-raising events, but nothing of any size," Mr. Mensch said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He declined to answer questions about any possible wedding plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wedding-day festivities are expected to take place under a large tent on the property of Astor Courts, the 50-acre John Jacob Astor IV-commissioned estate, where this week workers were repairing the stone wall at the property's entrance, and last weekend local fire trucks were sent over to water the vast lawn. The owners could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this week, a local helicopter company, <span class="companylink">Associated Aircraft Group</span>, inquired about the availability during the weekend of July 31 of the helipad located at Rhinebeck's Dutchess County Fair, according to fairground general manager Bob Grems. The helicopter company is a wholly owned subsidiary of <span class="companylink">Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation</span>, and "Sikorskys helicopters are used for Marine One, the Presidential helicopter," according to the company's website. The inquiry "was clearly in the context of the wedding," Mr. Grems said. Associated's director of sales and marketing, Carolyn Marino, declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But despite the long list of locals involved, there are signs that perhaps the resident cynics are right, and the plans are a charade. At the Beekman Arms &amp;Delamater Inn, rumored to be the hotel of choice for wedding guests, owner George Banta said he has not communicated with anyone associated with the nuptials. "Not a bit," Mr. Banta said. "I've heard that this event is going to take place, but I haven't talked to anyone. Nobody's told me anything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either way, come July 31, Ms. Clinton and Mr. Mezvinsky can expect to see signs like the one Mr. Staley plans to hang outside his real estate firm: "Congratulations, Chelsea and Marc." Said Mr. Staley: "I'll be manning my office, hoping someone brings their checkbook."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Andy Kessler   </div><div>897 words</div><div>16 July 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bull markets, it is said, climb a wall of worry. Smart investors buy in early when worries about profits or inflation or wars scare away the faint of heart. Latecomers then bid up stocks as each worry becomes unfounded, until there is nothing left to worry about. Once there is only good news, the market peaks as there is no one left to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bear markets, on the other hand, fall into what I like to call the pit of doom. Forget about worries—actual bad stuff happens, until nothing bad is left to happen and the market bottoms as there is no one left to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From early May through last week, the market dropped 1500 points into the pit, on the backs of gushing BP oil, riots in Europe, a 30% drop in pending home sales and the news that maybe your next door neighbor is a Russian spy. But now we've seen 680 Dow points added over seven straight up days before a slight decline yesterday. What the heck is going on?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Call it the yo-yo market—from the top of the wall to the bottom of the pit and back—and you better get used to it. It's hard to tell which market moves are real and based on prospects for better profits, as opposed to moves that are driven by all the extraordinary government measures to prop up the world economy. Until a few things are resolved, you'd better learn the yo-yo sleeper trick—that is, keep spinning at the bottom without going up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ZIRP: We live in abnormal times. The Fed is running what is essentially a zero interest rate policy, aka ZIRP. The stock market lacks a compass, a true north, to find its way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good news, like the private sector adding 80,000 workers in May, or container shipping up 12% over last year, is truly good news. Bad news, like Portugal's debt downgrade or a 10.8% drop in auto sales in June, suggests the economy is slowing. No wonder the market can't figure out which is the dominant trend. And so it goes up and down, up and down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make things worse, the Fed's zero policy is wreaking havoc in the real world, not just on Wall Street. In most companies, projects are funded when expected returns are higher than the risk-free rate of return, i.e., investing in T-bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the risk-free rate today is a big fat zero! Every project makes sense, which can't possibly be right, so corporate planners sit on their hands and companies just sit on their piles of cash. The sooner we zip the ZIRP, the sooner we return to some sort of normal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crutches: We all know that the economy is being held up on crutches—the biggest being the Fed printing dollars, a quantitative easing that saw the monetary base jump to $2 trillion today from $800 billion in September 2008. That program stopped March 31 and at some point has to reverse. May's 33% drop in home sales, despite record low mortgage rates, happened because an $8,000 tax credit expired at the end of April. Auto sales are down as "Cash for Clunkers" expired eight months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we still have the crutch of the remaining funds (about half) from the 2009 stimulus bill. And now the Europeans are threatening a new round of euro printing. The stock market won't believe that growth and profits are real until it sees the economy without these crutches. Until then, the yo-yo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxes/Seizures: January 2011 will most likely see the expiration of the Bush tax cuts. ObamaCare means higher levies on most Americans. There is talk of a value-added tax and a lame duck Congress porkfest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is even more troubling is the prospect of government seizures built into the Dodd-Frank financial bill. This is much like the seizure of property from auto industry bond holders (denounced as speculators) in the bankruptcy of GM and Chrysler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dodd-Frank also provides government leeway to seize firms it considers a systemic risk, without really defining what that systemic risk is. Why anyone would provide debt to large financial institutions (or auto makers) is beyond me, certainly not without demanding a huge premium for the seizure risk. The cost of capital for the U.S. economy is sure to rise, slowing growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until public policy returns to some semblance of stability, or at least more certainty, get used to 1000 point swings. Get used to the fans of gold and canned goods leading us to the pit of doom one week and bullish optimists up the wall of worry the next. For me, I like to get my bad news over with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm waiting for Spain to melt down the World Cup to pay off its debts, or more seriously, real defaults from Spain, Greece and maybe California and New York. Let's get on with it and put the structural reforms behind us. That would be a true buy signal.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our visitors are due in just a few days, so we're nervously going over our to-do list. Are the windows spotless, to show off the mountain views? Check. The playroom above the garage—can we make it clean and inviting for the kids? Sure. The Jacuzzi on the patio? It's just beckoning us for a midsummer dip. And we can't wait to try out that Bose sound system we're so proud of. In short, this lakefront retreat looks and feels primped, primed and ready for a great party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it's a shame we're not having one. And it's even more of a shame, we think with some envy, that it's not our house. This Shelburne, Vt., lakefront retreat belongs to a developer named John Giebink. And we're here to sweat the details because we're trying to sell the place—we just earned our real estate license a week ago, and Mr. Giebink is our firm's client.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worst of the home-price nosedive may be over, but selling a home can still feel like an agonizing stalemate. Nationwide, the average home sits on the market for 150 days, up 43% from two years ago, according to Altos Research. In the Burlington, Vt., area where we're working, the typical high-end house stays on the market for 284 days. To be sure, things aren't as grim as they once were, with low mortgage rates and Congress's now-expired tax breaks having lured bargain hunters into the market. But buyers have become ruthless nickel-and-dimers, the pros say, combing the web for sales data, tax records and any other clue that can justify a lowball offer. Homeowners, meanwhile, aren't hesitating to pull properties off the market if offers are weak. And in many communities, this mutual wariness is slowing sales traffic to a crawl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate cold war is putting unprecedented pressure on the people in the middle: real estate agents. Jackpot winners during the housing boom, these pros sometimes seem like a dying breed today. Their numbers have dropped 24% in the past two years, to 1.5 million, and discount websites and chintzy customers put constant pressure on their already wilted commission income. "Consumers are looking at agents differently and saying, 'We don't need to buy the full level of service,' " says Katherine Pancak, professor of finance and real estate at the University of Connecticut. Instead, it's more common to find diligent brokers taking on distinctly unglamorous tasks: scrubbing out carpet stains at 11 p.m. or running to the store to replace appliances that sellers have ripped out. "We're jumping through hoops to keep people happy," says Meg Handler, a Burlington agent and one of our new colleagues. "Every little detail becomes a big deal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, for all their challenges, brokers remain undeniably influential—they're still involved in the vast majority of home sales. That's why we decided to join their ranks, getting trained as a salesperson so we could see how the industry's big fish and small fry are adjusting to the new order. (The potential buyers and sellers we worked with knew we were reporting for SmartMoney.) We're not alone in wanting to climb aboard. States including Texas, Michigan and New York have seen increases of around 10% in real estate licensing applications in the past year. But becoming an agent took us in directions we never would have anticipated. The training course was surprisingly short, the exam was surprisingly long—and the most valuable tools of the trade, we learned, were a folding chair and a pooper-scooper. We were willing to jump through these hoops, as long as it could help us answer the ultimate question: Did we have what it took to sell a house?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a wood and stone manor whose landscaping slopes down to the waters of Lake Champlain, we're dealing with a skeptical prospective buyer. She's already voiced doubts about the dining room (low ceilings) and the garage (too small). So to crank up the charm factor, we take her out to the dock, where she can get the full impact of the afternoon light on the water. She seems duly impressed—that is, until we both step onto the dock and it starts rocking like the San Andreas Fault. We ought to say something reassuring, but instead we're obsessed with two thoughts: First, our 40-hour licensing seminar didn't cover this; and second, we just jeopardized a fat commission. Fortunately, we're bailed out by the preppy, confident Brian Boardman, who rushes out and assures the visitor that everything will be fine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Boardman is a top agent at Coldwell Banker Hickok &amp; Boardman Realty, the agency that's training us. If you were recruiting a real estate ace out of central casting, you'd grab Mr. Boardman, with his salt-and-pepper hair and his car that reads upscale Vermont. (Sure, it's an SUV, but it's a Lexus hybrid SUV.) A former Wall Street currency trader, he has spent the past 19 years becoming a local power player. He serves on the boards of major nonprofits—great places to build contacts among the gracious-home crowd. Still, veterans like him need rookies like us: For example, while he's hosting the prospective buyer at Shaky Dock Manor, his assistant, Sue Wilson, is at the office, managing his schedule, writing ad copy and booking photographers to shoot his properties. "I actually could use another assistant," Mr. Boardman says. While the average agent at his firm was involved in 19 sales in 2009, Mr. Boardman racked up 52. Without assistants, most agents agree, such volume wouldn't be possible. But some sellers find themselves listing a property with a big-name agent only to find that assistants do most of the work, including showing the house. Not surprisingly, this rankles. "The old saying is 'You never see the queen,'" says Glenn Kelman, CEO of Redfin, an online brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Boardman says he doesn't subscribe to that adage: "I don't go on vacation all summer, because that's the busy season." At Mr. Giebink's house, he's certainly a strong presence; he suggests the mix of jazz and classical music that will play on the Bose when buyers visit (it's all part of "selling the experience"). In an effort to perfect that experience, Mr. Boardman will often advise owners to redo an entire room, sometimes with the help of his wife, an interior designer. It's easily worth spending a few thousand on upgrades, he argues, if it helps move a multimillion-dollar house. (That's one reason Mr. Giebink is reshingling his garage and redoing that playroom.) For all the confidence Mr. Boardman exudes, though, he isn't sure that either of the big homes we've seen will be selling any time soon. After all, there are dozens of listings in the area for homes that are $1 million and up, and only 12 of that type sold here last year. As Mr. Boardman puts it, "We have a five-year supply."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We like a bucolic mountain vista as much as anyone, but the main reason we've chosen to work in Burlington is that Vermont lets people get their real estate license after just 40 hours of course work. And as we quickly learn, very little of that course work has much to do with selling real estate. We complete a correspondence course online in a little over a week, memorizing such crucial details as the official Vermont definition of a stream: "A current of water which is above an elevation of 1,500 feet above sea level or which flows at any time at a rate of less than 1.5 cubic feet per second." We also learn that back in the Middle Ages, a seller would transfer property by giving the buyer a bundle of sticks from a tree on the land. We take our licensing exam at the crack of dawn in a high school science classroom (complete with Bunsen burners) in Barre, Vt. The 110-question, multiple-choice test includes a math problem on the capital gains tax (we think we missed that one) and a question on whether refusing to rent to gay individuals violates the Fair Housing Act of 1968 (it doesn't). A few days later we get our results: 93 percent on the state portion. We feel pretty good; typically, about 20 percent of Vermont applicants fail the test, and many states have much higher failure rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, compared with some other professions, the barriers to entry in real estate are fairly low. In a mint-green classroom at the New York Real Estate Institute, a trade school that claims more than 60,000 graduates, we meet Zoryana Stetsyna, 26, who tells us that she recently decided last-minute to ditch law school. Taking out $100,000 in loans didn't seem worth it, and studying for the New York real estate exam, she says, is "a lot easier than studying for the LSAT." Interestingly, the average person here is noticeably older than Stetsyna. Eric Barron, managing director of the institute, says applicants "have definitely been skewing to the more mature" since the recession; as older layoff victims contemplate how to leverage their Rolodexes, more of the institute's students are now over 35.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mature or not, new agents hardly lead a life of glamour. Back in Burlington, we join Jamie Wright, a two-year Hickok &amp; Boardman veteran, at a modest condo near the airport. (Listing price: $144,900 for a two-bedroom townhouse.) This is far from Brian Boardman's world—our unit features cobwebs flanking the stairwell, a bathroom light fixture with five of six bulbs missing, and a fresh pile of dog poop sitting next to the back deck. Jamie isn't equipped to clean ("that's really up to the owner"), but she's armed with cheat sheets listing stats about the property, "open house" signs and, perhaps most important, a folding chair—which we're soon eyeing jealously, since the home's unfurnished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 50 minutes in, we get our first visitors—Scott Hendela and Jessica Fulton, who just arrived from Hawaii. The couple signs our contact list: Technically, they're the second entry because, as Wright has taught us, you always write a fake name on the first line. "People aren't as intimidated if they think someone else has been here," she says. Our instinct is to follow them like an excited puppy, pointing out the bright, open floor plan—and diverting their attention from the flaws. But Wright suggests we let them explore alone; if they come to their own conclusions, she says, she'll have a better sense of how to pitch properties to them. Indeed, while Mr. Hendela and Ms. Fulton aren't wild about this condo, they're bursting with questions. By the time they leave, Ms. Wright knows they need to find a place within 60 days and that they haven't met with other agents. She immediately drafts an email chock-full of listings in their price range. Thanks in part to Ms. Wright's attention, Mr. Hendela and Ms. Fulton are soon our firm's clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most markets, newer agents start out almost exclusively representing buyers. Buyers become a crucial part of an agent's ascent, industry veterans say, because sellers often turn around and hire the agents who helped them buy. But in an economic climate like this, where buyers are pinching every penny, these agents have to do more to collect their checks. Over an 18-day span, Ms. Wright hits the road almost every afternoon with Mr. Hendela and Ms. Fulton, logging more than 30 hours with them. It's slow going at first. The couple is afraid to tell us they don't like anything, so they email Ms. Wright at night to tell us bad news. Ms. Wright is cautious and quiet herself, trying to avoid being "salesy." And in our function as trailing trainee and assistant to Ms. Wright, we're not sure how helpful we are. At one showing, caught up in an enthusiastic moment, we eagerly tell the couple they can use a large downstairs space as an extra bedroom. Ms. Wright is quick to correct us; there's only one means of egress, so in Vermont, it can't be marketed as a bedroom. Our $375 in real estate–course tuition doesn't feel especially well spent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, as we learn their likes and dislikes, our rapport improves substantially. By the time we enter a townhouse at 102 Valade Street—the 20th property we've shown them—we're practiced at parrying their concerns. The contender has parquet floors, which Ms. Fulton can't stand. Ms. Wright counterattacks: The kitchen countertops are in great shape, and the bathroom has a big linen closet. And thanks to the attached garage, when winter comes they won't have to lace up their boots and trek into the snow to grab, say, a cellphone they've left in the car. The couple seem enticed but not convinced. After they leave we unwind with Ms. Wright over a glass of wine at a cocktail lounge. Ms. Wright and her husband just bought a home; she hasn't had a day off in two weeks, and she looks wiped out. "I've seen them more than I've seen my husband this week," she says of her clients. A bit later, as if to remind us of how far we are from the big leagues, we see Brian Boardman shaking hands with pals as he leaves a show at the Flynn Center for the Performing Arts—where, of course, he's on the board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But just as we're starting to commiserate, Ms. Wright gets a text message: Mr. Hendela and Ms. Fulton want to make a deal. It takes several rounds of offers, but within a few days we've got a contract: $165,000 for the parquet-floor condo. Ms. Wright earns the appreciation of her firm for "keeping it in the family"—the property is listed for sale with Hickok &amp; Boardman, so the agency gets a piece of both the buyer's and seller's commissions. Her personal compensation will be about $2,200, the equivalent of about $70 an hour by our calculation. Our main role? Helping draw up the offer sheet and providing moral support as the couple writes a big deposit check—their first, as well as ours.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some banks have a special technique for dealing with business borrowers who can't repay loans coming due: Give them more time, hoping things improve and they can repay later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks call it a wise strategy. Skeptics call it "extend and pretend."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks are applying it, in particular, to commercial real-estate lending, where, during the boom, optimistic borrowers got in over their heads to the tune of tens of billions of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big push by banks in recent months to modify such loans-- by stretching out maturities or allowing below-market interest rates-- has slowed an increase in defaults. It also has helped preserve banks' capital, by keeping some dicey loans classified as "performing" and thus minimizing the amount of cash banks must set aside in reserves for future losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Restructurings of nonresidential loans stood at $23.9 billion at the end of the first quarter, more than three times the level a year earlier and seven times the level two years earlier. While not all were for commercial real estate, the total makes clear that large numbers of commercial-property borrowers got some leeway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the practice is creating uncertainties about the health of both the commercial-property market and some banks. The concern is that rampant modification of souring loans masks the true scope of the commercial property market weakness, as well as the damage ultimately in store for bank balance sheets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Atlanta, Georgian Bank lent $13.5 million to a company in late 2007, some of it to buy land for a 53-story luxury Mandarin Oriental hotel and condo development. The loan came due in November 2008, but the bank extended its maturity date by a year. The bank extended it again to May 2010, with an option for a further extension to November 2010, according to court documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Georgia's banking regulator shut down the bank last September. A subsequent U.S. regulatory review cited "lax" loan underwriting and "an aggressive growth strategy . . . that coincided with declining economic conditions in the Atlanta metropolitan area." Some of Georgian Bank's assets were assumed by First Citizens Bank &amp;Trust Co. of Columbia, S.C., which began foreclosure proceedings on the still-unbuilt luxury development. The borrowers contested the move, and settlement talks are in progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also in Atlanta, <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. has extended a loan twice for a high-end shopping and residential project. Three years after a developer launched the Streets of Buckhead project as a European-style shopping district, all there is to show for it is a covey of silent cranes and a fence. The developer, Ben Carter, says he is in final negotiations for an investor to come in and inject $200 million into the languishing development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators helped spur banks' recent approach to commercial real estate by crafting new guidelines last October. They gave banks a variety of ways to restructure loans. And they allowed banks to record loans still operating under the original terms as "performing" even if the value of the underlying property had fallen below the loan amount -- which is an ominous sign for ultimate repayment. Although regulators say banks shouldn't take the guidelines as a signal to cut borrowers more slack, it appears some did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks hold some $176 billion of souring commercial-real-estate loans, according to an estimate by research firm Foresight Analytics. About two-thirds of bank commercial real-estate loans maturing between now and 2014 are underwater, meaning the property is worth less than the loan on it, Foresight data show. U.S. commercial-real-estate values remain 42% below their October 2007 peak and only slightly above the low they hit in October 2009, according to Moody's Investors Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first quarter, 9.1% of commercial-property loans held by banks were delinquent, compared with 7% a year earlier and just 1.5% in the first quarter of 2007, according to Foresight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Holding off on foreclosing is often good business, says Mark Tenhundfeld, senior vice president at the American Bankers Association. "It can be better for a bank to extend a loan and increase the chance that the bank will be repaid in full rather than call the loan due now and dump more property on an already-depressed market," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But continuing to extend loans and otherwise modify them, rather than foreclosing, amounts to a bet that the economy will rebound enough to enable clients to find new demand for the plethora of offices, hotels, condos and other property on which they borrowed. If it doesn't work out this way, the banks will end up having to write off the loans anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that point, if they haven't been setting aside sufficient cash all along for potential losses on such loans, the banks will face a hit to their earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks' reluctance to bite the bullet on some deteriorating commercial real estate can have economic repercussions. The readiness to stretch out loans puts a floor under commercial real estate and keeps it from hitting bottom, which may be a precondition for a robust revival.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More broadly, the failure to get the loans off banks' books tends to deter new lending to others. It's a pattern somewhat reminiscent, although on a lesser scale, of the way Japanese banks' failure to write off souring loans in the 1990s contributed to years of stagnation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a Catch-22 for banks. As long as some of their capital is tied up in real-estate loans that are struggling -- and as the banks see a pipeline of still-more sour real-estate debt that will mature soon -- their lending is likely to remain constricted. But to wipe the slate clean by writing off many more loans would mean an even bigger hit to their capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It does not take much of a write-down to wipe out capital," says Christopher Marinac, managing principal at FIG Partners LLC, a bank research and investment firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal bank regulators tackled the issues in October with a 33-page set of guidelines. Bank regulators have said they were concerned about commercial-property losses and debts coming due on commercial property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another problem they sought to resolve was that banks and their examiners weren't always on the same page. In some cases banks weren't recognizing loan problems, while in other cases, tough bank examiners were forcing banks to downgrade loans the bankers believed were still good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The guidance was intended "to promote both prudent commercial real-estate loan workouts by banks and balanced and consistent reviews of these loans by the supervisory agencies," said Elizabeth Duke, a Federal Reserve governor, in a March speech. The guidelines came from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, which includes the Fed, the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. and the Comptroller of the Currency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although one goal was greater consistency in the treatment of commercial real-estate loans, in practice, the guidelines appear to have fed confusion in the markets about how banks are dealing with commercial real-estate debt. "I just don't believe that the standard is being applied consistently across the industry," says Edward Wehmer, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Wintrust Financial Corp</span>. in Lake Forest, Ill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a May conference call with 1,400 bank executives, regulators sought to clear up confusion. "We don't want banks to pretend and extend," Sabeth Siddique, Federal Reserve assistant director of credit risk, said on the call. "We did hear from investors and some bankers interpreting this guidance as a form of forbearance, and let me assure you it's not."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Restructurings increased at some banks, like <span class="companylink">BB&amp;T Corp</span>. of Winston-Salem, N.C. Its total of one type of restructured commercial loan hit $969 million in recent months, the bank reported in April. That was a huge jump from six months earlier, when the figure was just $68 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase was "basically a function of implementing the new regulatory guidance," the bank's finance chief, Daryl Bible, told investors in May. "We are working with our customers trying to keep them in the loans."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">BB&amp;T</span>'s report showed a significant number of cases where it was extending loan maturities and allowing interest rates not widely available in the market for loans of similar risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks don't have to disclose how terms on their loans have changed, making it hard to know whether they are setting aside enough cash for possible losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a large proportion of cases, modifying the terms of loans ultimately isn't enough to save them. At the end of the first quarter, 44.5% of debt restructurings were 30 days or more delinquent or weren't accruing interest, up from 28% the first quarter of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A case in Portland, Ore., shows how banks can keep treating a commercial loan as current, despite the difficulties of the underlying project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A client called Touchmark Living Centers Inc. in 2007 borrowed $15.9 million, in two loans, to buy land for a development. The borrower planned to retire the loans at the end of the year by obtaining construction financing to build the Touchmark Heights community for empty-nesters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the raw land produced no income, the lender, <span class="companylink">Umpqua Bank</span>, had provided "interest reserves" with which the developer could cover interest payments while obtaining permits and preparing to build. The bank extended Touchmark a $350,000 interest reserve -- in effect increasing what Touchmark owed by that amount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December 2007, the U.S. economy slipped into recession. When the loans came due that month, Touchmark didn't pay them off. Umpqua extended the maturity to May 31, 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank also added $600,000 to the interest reserves. Though supplying interest reserves is common at the outset of a loan, when an unbuilt project can't produce any income with which to pay debt service, replenishing interest reserves is frowned on by regulators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked to comment, a spokeswoman for the bank said, "Umpqua and Touchmark had determined that the project was still viable but not yet ready for development." Touchmark said it didn't pursue construction financing at that time because "it was not prudent to proceed with developing the property until the economy improves," as a spokeswoman put it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008 the bank extended the loans again, to April 2009. During this time, Touchmark began paying interest on the loans out of its own pocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then in May 2009, Umpqua restructured the loans, lumping what was owed into one $15 million loan that required regular payments on both interest and principal. Touchmark paid down the principal a little and Umpqua set a new maturity date -- May 5, 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the value of the land Touchmark had borrowed to purchase has been eroding. The bank says it was worth $23.5 million by the most recent independent appraisal, but that was in 2008. The county assessment and taxation department pegged the land's value at about $20 million at the start of 2009. An appraiser for the department estimates raw-land values in the area fell by an additional 25% to 30% last year,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Touchmark executives declined to estimate the land's value. They said the property has retained "significant" value, partly because of its location, with a view of 3,425-meter Mount Hood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Umpqua Bank</span> says the loan is accruing interest, and it expects the loan to be repaid.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anita Likus and Ainsley Thomson </div><div>636 words</div><div>9 July 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>21</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON -- Private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Carlyle Group LP</span> said it had bought six landmark London properties that were formerly part of entrepreneur Simon Halabi's GBP 1 billion ($1.52 billion) property portfolio, for GBP 671 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The properties, which make up the Thames Portfolio and Alban Gate, total more than 1.6 million square feet, generating more than GBP 62 million of rent annually from tenants such as <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co</span>., UBS AG and <span class="companylink">International Business Machines Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The properties form part of a high-profile commercial mortgage-backed securities deal called White Tower 2006-3, the first British CMBS to be placed in liquidation since the start of the global financial crisis. Eight of the nine properties packaged in the White Tower deal have now been sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Halabi's company defaulted on a loan after falling property values left it in violation of a covenant governing the ratio of the loan's size to the portfolio's value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carlyle Group bought 60 Victoria Embankment, which has 420,000 square feet of office space fully rented to <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span>; Ludgate House, a 170,000-square-foot office building rented to <span class="companylink">United Business Media PLC</span>; Sampson House, a 350,000 square-foot building rented to IBM, Millennium Bridge House, a 200,000-square-foot office building fully rented to <span class="companylink">UBS</span>; BSI Tower, in the Chiswick neighborhood in west London, which is fully rented to BSI Management Systems Ltd.; and Alban Gate, a 382,000-square-foot office property on London Wall in the heart of the financial district know as the City and fully rented to <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carlyle European Real Estate managing director Robert Hodges said each of the properties has an existing secure income profile and that there were opportunities to manage and develop the portfolio, which he believes will "add significant value."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carlyle Group bought the properties on behalf of its third pan-European real-estate fund, Carlyle European Real Estate Partners III, which was launched in June 2008 with 2.2. billion euros of equity.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price to $47 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate of Nancy M. Daly, the late ex-wife of former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, has reduced the price on Ms. Daly's Malibu, Calif., estate to $47 million, a $10 million cut after more than four months on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The philanthropist and children's activist, who died last October of pancreatic cancer, bought the three lots comprising the land in the 1990s. The 0.75-acre estate has 180 feet of frontage on Carbon Beach, the "Billionaire's Beach" where <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> co-founder Paul Allen recently bought a contemporary for more than $25 million. The nearly 13,000-square-foot mansion, which Ms. Daly built in 2002, has eight bedrooms, nine fireplaces and multiple terraces. The double-height living area has a view of the Pacific through glass doors that slide into the wall. There's also a pool and a sports court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ron de Salvo and Chris Cortazzo of Coldwell Banker Previews International share the listing. "Most of the triple lots are 120 feet; 180 is very unusual," says Mr. de Salvo. Ms. Daly's estate sold her Beverly Hills home in May for $7.48 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cookie Magnate Debbi Fields</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeks Buyer in Aspen</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debbi Fields and her husband, Michael Rose, the former chief executive of Holiday Inn, are still searching for a buyer for their 501-acre ranch near Aspen, Colo. It's now listed at $28.5 million, 24% less than when they listed it in September 2008. It has now been at that lower price for more than a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rose bought the land in 1993 for $4.8 million. He and Ms. Fields built the 11,000-square-foot wood-and-glass house, inspired by Japanese architecture, in 2002 as a vacation home. "We had this vision that we would have all the kids coming to be with us, and that hasn't happened," says Ms. Fields, 53, who plans to look for a smaller home in the area. Penney Evans Carruth of Mason Morse has the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The heavily wooded property, where herds of elk pass through, borders a trout-filled lake and has a dock. The main house has five bedrooms, a caretaker's apartment and several decks. There's also a 2,500-square-foot guest house.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Applications for home loans rose last week as consumers raced to refinance at the lowest rates in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday that overall applications increased nearly 7% from a week earlier. While they have been increasing in recent weeks, they remain below early 2009 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications to refinance home loans were up 9% to the highest level since May 2009. But new mortgages taken out to purchase homes fell 2%, the eighth drop in the last nine weeks, after government tax credits that spurred home sales ended on April 30. Applications for mortgages to purchase homes were 35% below last year's levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate for a 30-year fixed loan sank to 4.58% last week, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That was the lowest since the mortgage company began keeping records in 1971.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates have fallen since mid-April. Investors, nervous about Europe's debt crisis and the global economy, have shifted money into the relative safety of Treasury bonds. That has caused the yields on those bonds to fall. Long-term fixed mortgage rates tend to track those yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications to refinance loans made up 79% of total applications, the highest share of refinancing activity since April 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mortgage Bankers Association's survey covers more than 50% of all applications nationwide and has been conducted since 1990.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">To Fix Sour Property Deals, Lenders 'Extend and Pretend'</span>
</div><div class="author">By Carrick Mollenkamp                And Lingling Wei   </div><div>1943 words</div><div>7 July 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some banks have a special technique for dealing with business borrowers who can't repay loans coming due: Give them more time, hoping things improve and they can repay later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks call it a wise strategy. Skeptics call it "extend and pretend."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks are applying it, in particular, to commercial real-estate lending, where, during the boom, optimistic borrowers got in over their heads to the tune of tens of billions of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big push by banks in recent months to modify such loans—by stretching out maturities or allowing below-market interest rates—has slowed a spike in defaults. It also has helped preserve banks' capital, by keeping some dicey loans classified as "performing" and thus minimizing the amount of cash banks must set aside in reserves for future losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Restructurings of nonresidential loans stood at $23.9 billion at the end of the first quarter, more than three times the level a year earlier and seven times the level two years earlier. While not all were for commercial real estate, the total makes clear that large numbers of commercial-property borrowers got some leeway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the practice is creating uncertainties about the health of both the commercial-property market and some banks. The concern is that rampant modification of souring loans masks the true scope of the commercial property market weakness, as well as the damage ultimately in store for bank balance sheets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Atlanta, Georgian Bank lent $13.5 million to a company in late 2007, some of it to buy land for a 53-story luxury Mandarin Oriental hotel and condo development. The loan came due in November 2008, but the bank extended its maturity date by a year. The bank extended it again to May 2010, with an option for a further extension to November 2010, according to court documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Georgia's banking regulator shut down the bank last September. A subsequent U.S. regulatory review cited "lax" loan underwriting and "an aggressive growth strategy…that coincided with declining economic conditions in the Atlanta metropolitan area." Some of Georgian Bank's assets were assumed by First Citizens Bank and Trust Co. of Columbia, S.C., which began foreclosure proceedings on the still-unbuilt luxury development. The borrowers contested the move, and settlement talks are in progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also in Atlanta, <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. has extended a loan twice for a high-end shopping and residential project. Three years after a developer launched the Streets of Buckhead project as a European-style shopping district, all there is to show for it is a covey of silent cranes and a fence. The developer, Ben Carter, says he is in final negotiations for an investor to come in and inject $200 million into the languishing development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators helped spur banks' recent approach to commercial real estate by crafting new guidelines last October. They gave banks a variety of ways to restructure loans. And they allowed banks to record loans still operating under the original terms as "performing" even if the value of the underlying property had fallen below the loan amount—which is an ominous sign for ultimate repayment. Although regulators say banks shouldn't take the guidelines as a signal to cut borrowers more slack, it appears some did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks hold some $176 billion of souring commercial-real-estate loans, according to an estimate by research firm Foresight Analytics. About two-thirds of bank commercial real-estate loans maturing between now and 2014 are underwater, meaning the property is worth less than the loan on it, Foresight data show. U.S. commercial-real-estate values remain 42% below their October 2007 peak and only slightly above the low they hit in October 2009, according to Moody's Investors Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first quarter, 9.1% of commercial-property loans held by banks were delinquent, compared with 7% a year earlier and just 1.5% in the first quarter of 2007, according to Foresight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Holding off on foreclosing is often good business, says Mark Tenhundfeld, senior vice president at the American Bankers Association. "It can be better for a bank to extend a loan and increase the chance that the bank will be repaid in full rather than call the loan due now and dump more property on an already-depressed market," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But continuing to extend loans and otherwise modify them, rather than foreclosing, amounts to a bet that the economy will rebound enough to enable clients to find new demand for the plethora of offices, hotels, condos and other property on which they borrowed. If it doesn't work out this way, the banks will end up having to write off the loans anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that point, if they haven't been setting aside sufficient cash all along for potential losses on such loans, the banks will face a hit to their earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks' reluctance to bite the bullet on some deteriorating commercial real estate can have economic repercussions. The readiness to stretch out loans puts a floor under commercial real estate and keeps it from hitting bottom, which may be a precondition for a robust revival.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More broadly, the failure to get the loans off banks' books tends to deter new lending to others. It's a pattern somewhat reminiscent, although on a lesser scale, of the way Japanese banks' failure to write off souring loans in the 1990s contributed to years of stagnation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a Catch-22 for banks. As long as some of their capital is tied up in real-estate loans that are struggling—and as the banks see a pipeline of still-more sour real-estate debt that will mature soon—their lending is likely to remain constricted. But to wipe the slate clean by writing off many more loans would mean an even bigger hit to their capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It does not take much of a write-down to wipe out capital," says Christopher Marinac, managing principal at FIG Partners LLC, a bank research and investment firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal bank regulators tackled the issues in October with a 33-page set of guidelines. Bank regulators have said they were concerned about commercial-property losses and debts coming due on commercial property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another problem they sought to resolve was that banks and their examiners weren't always on the same page. In some cases banks weren't recognizing loan problems, while in other cases, tough bank examiners were forcing banks to downgrade loans the bankers believed were still good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The guidance was intended "to promote both prudent commercial real-estate loan workouts by banks and balanced and consistent reviews of these loans by the supervisory agencies," said Elizabeth Duke, a Federal Reserve governor, in a March speech. The guidelines came from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, which includes the Fed, the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. and the Comptroller of the Currency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although one goal was greater consistency in the treatment of commercial real-estate loans, in practice, the guidelines appear to have fed confusion in the markets about how banks are dealing with commercial real-estate debt. "I just don't believe that the standard is being applied consistently across the industry," says Edward Wehmer, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Wintrust Financial Corp</span>. in Lake Forest, Ill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a May conference call with 1,400 bank executives, regulators sought to clear up confusion. "We don't want banks to pretend and extend," Sabeth Siddique, Federal Reserve assistant director of credit risk, said on the call. "We did hear from investors and some bankers interpreting this guidance as a form of forbearance, and let me assure you it's not."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Restructurings increased at some banks, like <span class="companylink">BB&amp;T Corp</span>. of Winston-Salem, N.C. Its total of one type of restructured commercial loan hit $969 million in recent months, the bank reported in April. That was a huge jump from six months earlier, when the figure was just $68 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase was "basically a function of implementing the new regulatory guidance," the bank's finance chief, Daryl Bible, told investors in May. "We are working with our customers trying to keep them in the loans."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">BB&amp;T</span>'s report showed a significant number of cases where it was extending loan maturities and allowing interest rates not widely available in the market for loans of similar risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks don't have to disclose how terms on their loans have changed, making it hard to know whether they are setting aside enough cash for possible losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a large proportion of cases, modifying the terms of loans ultimately isn't enough to save them. At the end of the first quarter, 44.5% of debt restructurings were 30 days or more delinquent or weren't accruing interest, up from 28% the first quarter of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A case in Portland, Ore., shows how banks can keep treating a commercial loan as current, despite the difficulties of the underlying project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A client called Touchmark Living Centers Inc. in 2007 borrowed $15.9 million, in two loans, to buy land for a development. The borrower planned to retire the loans at the end of the year by obtaining construction financing to build the Touchmark Heights community for empty-nesters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the raw land produced no income, the lender, <span class="companylink">Umpqua Bank</span>, had provided "interest reserves" with which the developer could cover interest payments while obtaining permits and preparing to build. The bank extended Touchmark a $350,000 interest reserve—in effect increasing what Touchmark owed by that amount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December 2007, the U.S. economy slipped into recession. When the loans came due that month, Touchmark didn't pay them off. Umpqua extended the maturity to May 31, 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank also added $600,000 to the interest reserves. Though supplying interest reserves is common at the outset of a loan, when an unbuilt project can't produce any income with which to pay debt service, replenishing interest reserves is frowned on by regulators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked to comment, a spokeswoman for the bank said, "Umpqua and Touchmark had determined that the project was still viable but not yet ready for development." Touchmark said it didn't pursue construction financing at that time because "it was not prudent to proceed with developing the property until the economy improves," as a spokeswoman put it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008 the bank extended the loans again, to April 2009. During this time, Touchmark began paying interest on the loans out of its own pocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then in May 2009, Umpqua restructured the loans, lumping what was owed into one $15 million loan that required regular payments on both interest and principal. Touchmark paid down the principal a little and Umpqua set a new maturity date—May 5, 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the value of the land Touchmark had borrowed to purchase has been eroding. The bank says it was worth $23.5 million by the most recent independent appraisal, but that was in 2008. The county assessment and taxation department pegged the land's value at about $20 million at the start of 2009. An appraiser for the department estimates raw-land values in the area fell by another 25% to 30% last year,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Touchmark executives declined to estimate the land's value. They said the property has retained "significant" value, partly because of its location, with a view of 11,240-foot Mount Hood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Umpqua Bank</span> says the loan is accruing interest, and it expects the loan to be repaid.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on new construction declined at an annual rate of 8% in May, led by another large drop in commercial construction. The value of construction spending was running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $841.9 billion in May compared with $915.4 billion in May a year ago. Residential construction was up 11.9% in May from a year earlier at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $270.2 billion. Commercial construction fell 15.2% to $571.7 billion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortress Investment Group LLP is raising its commercial-real-estate bets while that market remains down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York private-equity firm on Thursday said its funds have acquired CW Financial Services, one of the largest servicers of souring commercial mortgages packaged into bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent days, Fortress also closed on a roughly $250 million investment in daVinci Holdings KK, a high-profile and struggling Japanese real-estate firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the two Fortress deals are relatively small -- the firm is paying about $300 million for CW, according to people familiar with the acquisition -- they highlight the opportunities distressed investors see in sagging commercial-property markets around the globe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S. and Japan, the values of hotels, office buildings and other commercial property are at or near multiyear lows, attracting bargain hunters. There are now $230 billion of troubled real-estate assets globally, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortress would appear well positioned to exploit the distress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the firm, with $42 billion in assets, has an array of investments, from ski resorts to nursing homes to global currencies and commodities, many of its top managers have backgrounds in real estate. Chairman Wes Edens was a top Wall Street mortgage trader before co-founding Fortress. The firm's chief executive is Daniel Mudd, the former CEO of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite that promise, Fortress's stock price continues to struggle. The firm, the first U.S. private-equity and hedge-fund firm to go public, has seen its stock price drop 84% since its February 2007 initial public offering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortress has been buffeted by billions of dollars of paper losses in its private-equity funds and questions about its ability to raise money in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In acquiring CW, Fortress enters a hot, niche business attracting attention from big-name investors. Needham, Mass.-based CW, known as a special servicer, acts as coordinator for bondholders holding about $160 billion of debt backed by properties should these properties go into default. Among the largest troubled loans in the company's portfolio is the roughly $3 billion of debt on New York apartment complexes Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, which are facing foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortress is acquiring the company from Otera Capital, a subsidiary of Canadian pension manager Caisse de Depot &amp;Placement du Quebec. A number of other firms bid for CW, including <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span> and <span class="companylink">Starwood Capital Group</span>. Representatives of Vornado and Starwood declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are keen on special servicers because of the rising default rate of commercial mortgages that were packaged into securities to feed Wall Street's deal-making machine and investor appetites. According to Fitch Ratings, more than 11% of $536 billion of loans packaged into commercial-mortgage-backed securities are expected to be at least 60 days past due by year's end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Special servicers also have the option to buy the troubled assets they manage for bondholders, an attractive proposition for distressed investors like Fortress. In recent months, there have been several deals for special servicers, including a joint venture between <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Leucadia National Corp</span>. that acquired <span class="companylink">Capmark Financial Group Inc</span>.'s commercial mortgage-servicing business. Real-estate investor Andrew Farkas also recently completed a deal to acquire Centerline Holding Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another market that distressed investors are circling is Japanese real estate. In recent years, the property-related companies ranked high among Japan's bankruptcies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DaVinci Holdings has been among the harder hit, having borrowed heavily at the market peak in 2006 and 2007 to acquire four large office buildings in Tokyo for 543.5 billion yen ($6.19 billion).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortress is acquiring a $250 million loan originally made to daVinci by <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>, according to an email sent to daVinci's investors. Though a debt play, the investment gives Fortress a foothold into the struggling Japanese real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investment is reminiscent of the 1990s, when a number of foreign firms, such as Dallas-based investment firm <span class="companylink">Lone Star Funds</span> and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>., scooped up real estate on the cheap after Japan's stock and real-estate bubble burst.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sara Murray and Michael S. Arnold </div><div>908 words</div><div>2 July 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing lost momentum around the world in June, adding to worries that global economies are poised for slower growth in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index based on a survey of U.S. purchasing managers suggested that factory output expanded for the 11th month in June, but at a slower pace than the month before. Similar pullbacks occurred in China and the euro zone last month, according to separate indexes released Thursday. Japan was one of the few places where the factory sector has gained steam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. and other major economies have relied heavily on manufacturing as a growth engine coming out of the recession. The question now is whether the slowing pace is more than just a natural adjustment as producers recover from the downturn. Many manufacturers have grown rapidly in recent months as they have restocked shelves, so some pullback in growth has been expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth in the U.S. factory sector is slowing, said Jay Feldman, a Credit Suisse Securities LLC analyst, "but we're slowing from a very strong pace."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, new filings for U.S. jobless benefits increased last week as the labor market continued to struggle. Pending home sales, no longer propped up by government incentives, declined as did construction spending. And a report earlier this week showed sagging consumer confidence. Those depressing signals weighed on investors on Thursday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average for the week fell 411 points, or 4.1% to 9732.53</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An important clue to the strength of the recovery will come Friday when the U.S. government releases its employment report. Economists expect the overall number to decline as temporary Census hiring comes to an end but they predict some private-sector job growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index fell to 56.2 in June from 59.7 the prior month as new orders, production and exports slowed. Figures above 50 indicate expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices continued to rise in June, the survey found, but the rate slowed dramatically -- a sign that inflation remains a distant worry for U.S. policy makers. A <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co</span>. and Markit Economics index of global manufacturing prices showed a widespread slowdown in input prices, though they were still rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Frankly our concern is deflation at this point," said <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>'s David Hensley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro zone's manufacturing machine also lost momentum, but only slightly. An index based on a survey of 3,000 manufacturing firms across the region fell to a four-month low of 55.6, from 55.8 the month before, according to Markit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth eased in China as well. In recent months Chinese authorities have moved to rein in the surging economy and prick potential asset bubbles, and Thursday's data suggested those steps are beginning to take hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's manufacturing index fell to 52.1 in June from 53.9 a month earlier, the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said. It was the second month in a row that the data showed slower growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend was repeated across the Asia-Pacific region as India, Australia, South Korea and Taiwan all experienced more sluggish growth. While that's likely to heighten concerns that the exit from the global recession has hit a significant speed bump, economists noted that Asia's economic growth remains generally strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What this likely signals is slow growth in the third quarter. But the data is not consistent with a hard landing," <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> senior Asian economist Frederic Neumann says. "To the extent that we see this as a normalization -- and not a double-dip recession -- the support that Asia lends to the world economy should still be there for the foreseeable future."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As factory growth slowed elsewhere in Asia, Japan was going the other way. Sentiment among manufacturers in that nation turned positive for the first time in two years in the second quarter, according to the Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan survey. Japan's manufacturing index rose to 1, from minus-14 for the first quarter. The figure represents the percent of companies saying business conditions are good, minus the percentage saying conditions are bad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S., meanwhile, continues to face severe headwinds from a weak job market. New claims for unemployment benefits rose by 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 472,000 for the week ended June 26, the Labor Department said Thursday. The four-week moving average for such claims, which smooths volatility in the data, also increased by 3,250 to 466,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of weakness in other corners of the U.S. economy emerged Thursday as well. An index of pending home sales dropped 30% to 77.6 in May, down from 110.9 in April, the National Association of Realtors said. The index is based on contract signings. The decline comes after three months of gains as buyers rushed to take advantage of a home-buyer tax credit which expired at the end of April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending also declined 0.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $841.9 billion in May, from the prior month and is 8% below year-ago levels, the Commerce Department said. Private construction declined while public construction spending increased.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commodities closely tied to global economic growth fell sharply Thursday as disappointing economic data heightened concerns about the sluggishness of the global recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude-oil futures fell 3.5% in New York trading, gasoline futures dropped below $2 a gallon and copper futures tumbled 2.5%, hurt by U.S. reports on manufacturing, unemployment, home sales and construction spending that added pressure to a market already skittish over the prospect of a slowdown in growth in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even gold -- which hit record highs in recent weeks as investors sought refuge in the metal amid concerns about debt problems in Europe and the deteriorating economic outlook -- settled nearly $40 lower, the biggest one-day decline in five months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in gold appeared to be tied to a sharp move higher in the euro, traders said, as investors turned more optimistic about the health of Europe's banks. A bearish bet on the euro, coupled with a bullish bet on gold, has been a popular trade among certain investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move to unwind some of those trades came amid a respite in fears about Europe's fiscal woes, following a successful debt auction by Spain and talk that some funds were selling to meet increased margin requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The losses in key commodities underscore increasing anxiety about the state of the global economy, fears that have also taken a toll on the stock market and sparked big gains for U.S. government bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All eyes now will be trained on the Friday morning release of the U.S. nonfarm-payrolls report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a shift in the collective mood. There's been, collectively, a certain amount of giving up of hope here," said Walter Zimmermann, chief technical analyst of United-ICAP. "Everything is in the same boat. If the economy fails to inflate, then there isn't hope for the key commodities."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for gasoline and crude oil is expected to slow if unemployment remains high, with fewer people commuting and some cutting back on trips to deal with strained budgets, particularly troubling for the U.S. summer-driving period. Adding to the gloom, both gasoline and crude inventories already are high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Light, sweet crude futures for August delivery settled down $2.68 to $72.95 a barrel on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>, while gasoline futures settled down 3.1% at $1.9976 a gallon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Copper, used for wiring and piping in new-home construction, is getting hit by concerns that demand will suffer amid continued weakness in housing. Any slowdown in China also would weigh heavily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Copper for September delivery, the most actively traded contract, fell 2.5% to $2.8770 per pound in the Comex division of Nymex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most-actively traded gold contract, for August delivery, fell $39.20, or 3.1% to settle at $1206.70 an ounce on the Comex. The contract dipped below $1200 in thin after-hours electronic trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some commodities managed to post gains amid the broader selloff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Natural-gas futures rose 5.2% on forecasts for hot weather in key consuming regions of the U.S. and government data showing a smaller-than-expected build-up of inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corn futures extended gains from Wednesday sparked by a surprise in U.S. government data showing lower stockpiles and fewer fields dedicated to new corn crops. The front-month corn contract rose 3.2%.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European stocks started the third quarter in a slide, as weak Chinese and U.S. economic data underlined doubts about the global economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro rose against the dollar, but oil and gold prices fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weaker-than-expected Chinese manufacturing data was the catalyst for a downturn in equities. China's purchasing managers index fell to 52.1 in June from 53.9 in May, marking the second straight month of slower growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Basic resources took the brunt of the selling as base metals prices declined. <span class="companylink">ArcelorMittal</span> fell 2.9% in Paris and <span class="companylink">Randgold Resources</span> declined 5.4% in London as the Stoxx 600 Europe basic-resources index fell 3.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pan-European Stoxx 600 index fell 2.5% to 237.30. France's CAC-40 index lost 3% to 3339.90, Germany's DAX fell 1.8% to 5857.43 and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 index slid 2.3% to 4805.75, a 2010 closing low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there were a few bright spots in the day's news, they were overshadowed by a raft of disappointing data out of the U.S., which pushed European stocks further into the red in the afternoon session. Jobless claims, manufacturing ISM and pending home sales all fell short of expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report showed the number of workers filling new claims for unemployment benefits rose by 13,000 last week, versus expectations for a 2,000 decline, while the ISM index fell to 56 and pending home sales in May plunged 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reports pushed U.S. stocks lower. In 4 p.m. trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 41.49 points, or 0.4%, to 9732.53. Prices of Treasurys rose, sending the 10-year and 30-year yields to their lowest since April 2009. Bond yields move inversely to prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year note rose 7/32 to 104 27/32, to yield 2.931%, and the 30-year bond rose 24/32 to 108 5/32, for a yield of 3.869%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic weakness more than offset any hint of optimism brought about by a well-received Spanish bond auction and a generous European Central Bank allotment of 112 billion euros ($137 billion) in six-day loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in the money market, the cost of borrowing euros in the interbank market surged, as banks repaid a hefty 442 billion euros one-year loan to the European Central Bank. Data from the British Bankers' Association showed the three-month euro London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, rose to 0.71750% from Wednesday's 0.70625%, its highest level since Sept. 21, 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports due Friday include the euro-zone producer-price index and unemployment rate. But the main focus will be on the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report. U.S. factory orders are also on the schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the currency markets, the euro got a boost from the successful Spanish bond auction. Late afternoon Wednesday in New York, the common currency was at $1.2492 from $1.2229 late Wednesday and sterling was at $1.5145 from $1.4939. The dollar was at 87.48 yen from 88.39 yen and at 1.0618 Swiss francs from 1.0777 francs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Light, sweet crude for August delivery fell $2.68, or 3.5%, to $72.95 a barrel on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>. Gold for July delivery slid $39.20, or 3.2%, to $1,206.30 per troy ounce on the Comex division of Nymex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In major market action: Auto makers were among the losers as French new-car registrations fell 1.2% in June. Renault fell 4% and <span class="companylink">Peugeot</span> tumbled 4.6%, while luxury-car maker <span class="companylink">BMW</span> fell 4.7% and rival Daimler lost 3.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deal speculation drove some stock activity. <span class="companylink">Chloride Group</span> fell 4.1% to 370 pence after Swedish-Swiss engineering giant ABB said it wouldn't match a nearly GBP 1 billion pound ($1.49 billion) offer by <span class="companylink">Emerson Electric</span> to buy the British power-systems specialist. The Emerson bid is valued at 375 pence a share. ABB shares fell 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of sugar producer <span class="companylink">Tate &amp;Lyle</span> rose 1% after it announced it would sell its EU Sugar Refining operations to American Sugar Refining -- better known as Domino Sugar -- for GBP 211 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BP shares also bucked the downward trend, rising 2.8%. The latest report from the oil giant suggests the first relief well to stem the Gulf oil spill may be completed earlier than forecast.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data released Thursday pointed to a broad economic slowdown, from less manufacturing growth to elevated claims for jobless benefits and declines in home construction and pending sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. factory activity slowed in June amid a moderation in inflationary pressures. The Institute for Supply Management, a private research group, reported Thursday that its manufacturing index fell to 56.2 from 59.7 in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Readings above 50 signal expansion, so June's reading represented continued growth at a slower pace. Economists had expected a slight moderation, to 59.0.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM report arrives at a time of increased anxiety over the U.S. economic outlook. Persistently high unemployment, modest gains in overall output, coupled with grinding weakness in housing and the threat posed by weak growth and financial problems in Europe, have driven up fears about what lies ahead for the U.S. recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM cautioned against reading too much into the report. "We are now 11 months into the manufacturing recovery, and given the robust nature of recent growth, it is not surprising that we would see a slower rate of growth at this time," said Norbert Ore, who directs the survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign of lingering weakness in the U.S. labor market, the number of workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week, the Labor Department reported Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its weekly report, the Labor Department said the number of U.S. workers filing initial claims for jobless benefits increased by 13,000 to 472,000 in the week ended June 26. The previous week's level was revised upward, from 457,000 to 459,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An economist at the Labor Department said the latest rise was mostly coming from the educational-services sector, where bus drivers, cafeteria workers and others lost their jobs due to the summer holidays. Claims lasting more than one week rose for the week ended June 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that claims remain high has been a concern both among Federal Reserve officials and economists. Despite some reported gains in jobs in May, forecasters are predicting that the June monthly jobs report due out Friday will likely display a drop in nonfarm payrolls. The unemployment rate is seen having edged higher to 9.8% in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jesse Rothstein, the chief economist at the Labor Department, said in a recent interview that he was unsure why claims have remained so elevated. "It's a concern," he said. "Some of it has to do with the economy not growing fast enough."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following three months of solid gains, U.S. pending home sales plunged 30% in May, the first month after the expiration of a tax-credit program that has been propping up the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' index for pending sales of existing homes dropped to 77.6 from 110.9 in April, the industry group said Thursday. While expected, the drop was steeper than the 13% economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales in May are down 15.9% from May 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The sharp decline in contract signings in May is a natural result with similar low levels of sales activity anticipated in June," NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government tax credit program, which provided $8,000 in credits to first time homebuyers, required contracts to be signed by the end of April.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Industrial &amp;Commercial Bank of China</span>, China's largest bank by assets, is rolling out a "large-loan" program aimed at U.S. commercial real-estate owners in need of loans that exceed $100 million, a category most U.S. banks now avoid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move by Beijing-based ICBC, which is 70% owned by the Chinese government, is part of a broader push into the U.S. market and comes as China's regulators are encouraging domestic financial institutions to expand overseas. Although many U.S. and European banks continue to struggle with losses tied to real-estate loans made during the bubble years, ICBC is betting that property values have fallen enough that the bank's lending risks will be limited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is very close to the bottom," says Wu Bin, general manager of ICBC's New York branch, located in the Trump Tower on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue. Demand for new commercial-real-estate loans is huge; property owners face more than $1 trillion of maturing debt over the next five years that must be refinanced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Because of the concentration risk associated with large loans, that is a market many U.S. lenders shy away from," says Josh Scoville, director of research at real-estate-services firm <span class="companylink">CoStar Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, scores of foreign banks from Japan to Germany have been clobbered by their aggressive push into the U.S. property market during the boom times. Mr. Wu says ICBC will limit its risk by financing buildings with stable existing cash flows and lending to developers and investors with a solid track record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese bank is offering to lend no more than 65% of a property's value. During the frenzy, U.S. banks had lent more than 80% of a building's value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new entrant provides the latest evidence that foreign capital is funneling into U.S. real estate, lured by beaten-down property values and signs that the U.S. economy is coming out of the recession faster than those of other developed countries. <span class="companylink">China Investment Corp</span>., the $300 billion sovereign-wealth fund, also is looking to pile cash into U.S. real estate through investing with U.S. property-fund managers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, despite ICBC's size and profitability, challenges abound for a foreign bank seeking to crack open a market also being courted by some large, well-capitalized domestic lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big U.S. banks like <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp;Co</span>. are coming off the sidelines as they hope to market commercial-property debt to yield-chasing investors as mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most U.S. banks are reluctant to lend more than $200 million to any single borrower because of the lingering difficulty of unloading risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ICBC says it could consider loans that are higher than $500 million, and it intends to hold loans on its books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wu, a 15-year veteran of ICBC who has spent most of his time for the bank overseas and speaks fluent English, is open about the challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Here, no one knows who you are," says Mr. Wu, wearing a pin of the bank's logo that resembles the Chinese word for industry. To counter the lack of name recognition, Mr. Wu brought in two local real-estate experts -- Proctor Wong, head of bank-services group at brokerage Newmark Knight Frank, and attorney Robert Koen at <span class="companylink">DLA Piper US LLP</span> -- to devise the lending initiative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early this month, ICBC closed its first commercial-property loan in the U.S. It contributed $150 million to a $355 million loan made to a partnership led by private-equity firm Carlyle Group. The venture used the loan to refinance the existing $325 million mortgage on 650 Madison Ave., a 27-story office-and-retail tower in midtown Manhattan. The rest of the loan was provided by <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Chung, a principal at Carlyle, says there was a "competitive" bidding process among lenders to provide financing to the building. "We understood ICBC had never done a real-estate deal in the U.S. But we were comfortable because of their size and global presence," he says, adding that Carlyle looks forward to "expanding the relationship globally."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> ignited a chorus of criticism last week when it said it would deny government-backed mortgages for seven years to borrowers who walked away from their existing mortgages, had the ability to pay and didn't make a good-faith effort to avoid foreclosure by negotiating with their lender. The government-owned mortgage-finance giant also said it will take legal action to recoup the loan balance against borrowers who "strategically default."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I say it's about time. These relatively affluent borrowers should pay a price—even if it is a modest one—for walking away from a contract. As it is, reports have been proliferating about homeowners who simply stop paying their mortgages, stay in their comfortable homes rent-free for the 18 months to two years or more it can take for the lender to foreclose, then get another government-backed loan and buy a new house. Who is to say they won't do it all over again?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor will encouraging people to default do anything to stem the rising tide of foreclosures and its potentially debilitating effect on housing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a looming crisis, given that an estimated one-quarter of all home mortgages are currently underwater, meaning that the house is worth less than the balance of the mortgage. The serious delinquency rate on mortgages backed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> has already soared to over 5%. Imagine if that leapt to over 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> became wards of the federal government, we taxpayers are footing the bill, which the Congressional Budget Office now estimates will reach an astonishing $389 billion. That is likely to be far more than the bank bailouts and dwarfs the cost of rescuing <span class="companylink">American International Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I was baffled by critics who equate this new policy to things like debtor's prison. Asking people to pay their mortgages when they can afford to is hardly locking people in a prison for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These owners chose their homes and presumably liked them. They had no guarantee that housing prices would appreciate indefinitely and never decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As I have argued before, walking away from a mortgage now is like selling at the bottom of the market. Houses that are underwater now may not be for long once housing starts to appreciate. And despite a recent slump in the number of home sales, home prices are rising in most areas and have been for the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor does home ownership convey a right to immediate mobility. Buying a home is a relatively long-term commitment, and most people expecting to move soon opt to rent instead. Even renting typically requires a one-year lease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone forced to move may have to sell at a loss, but they can also buy another home at lower market prices, unless they are moving from, say, Las Vegas to Manhattan. But that's their choice.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jon Hilsenrath and Mark Whitehouse </div><div>1029 words</div><div>30 June 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American stocks and bond yields fell sharply as concerns mounted that the economy might be in for a slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.6%, back below 10000 on slumping U.S. consumer confidence, the downward revision of a Chinese economic indicator and worries about the health of Europe's banks. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes fell below 3% to their lowest level since April 2009, a sign investors were seeking out safe investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board, a non-profit research group, reported Tuesday that consumer confidence dropped in June, wiping out gains from the previous two months. The index fell to 52.9, down sharply from a downwardly revised 62.7 the month before, with an increasing number of households saying jobs were "hard to get."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in the day, the Conference Board downwardly revised a leading indicator of Chinese economic growth. Investors were also jittery about the expiration of a European Central Bank program to extend 12-month financing to lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early trading Wednesday, major indexes in Japan, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore were down between 1% and 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A double-dip recession is still widely viewed as unlikely. But the drop in confidence is just the latest sign suggesting the economy could lose steam in the second half of 2010 and perhaps grow more slowly than in the first half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak job creation is a central part of the problem. Friday's report by the Labor Department on the job market in June is expected to show private-sector hiring perked up in June even as the Census Bureau laid off temporary workers. But gathering signs of economic headwinds suggest future job growth could be slim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among these headwinds: signs that the housing sector is heading into a new downturn, and financial conditions that have turned less supportive of growth as stock prices decline, the dollar strengthens and credit markets struggle. The global backdrop has grown more uncertain as European governments such as the U.K. and Germany turn their attention to closing budget deficits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are reasons for optimism. Individual incomes are rising and supportive of steady growth in consumer spending. Corporate cash flows are strong and supportive of investment and hiring. The industrial recovery, though it could lose some momentum as inventory rebuilding slows, has been robust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy grew at a 2.7% annual rate in the first quarter, and economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal on average believe it grew at a 3.6% pace in the second quarter, which ends Wednesday. The consensus is for a modest 3% growth rate in the second half, but some forecasters call that optimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm getting more pessimistic about the ability for the economy to reaccelerate in the fourth quarter and in the first half of 2011," says Paul Kasriel, chief economist at the Northern Trust bank in Chicago. He expects the economy to grow at a rate of around 2.5% in the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Barack Obama expressed optimism about the outlook after a morning meeting with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. Mr. Obama said he and Mr. Bernanke "share the view that the economy is strengthening," noting that the U.S. has gone from losing 750,000 jobs per month last year to five months of job growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing weighing on the economy is the housing market, which, after stabilizing, is weakening again as government support disappears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Petit, owner of M&amp;M Contractors in Salem, Mass., says he saw a significant uptick in roofing and other business in March, April and May, as people did storm-related repairs and fixed up homes for sale. In June, though, business has been down about 20% from a year earlier. "I was pretty busy but I didn't think it was going to last," he says. "Unfortunately, I was right."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pauses aren't uncommon early in a recovery. After rebounding from recession in late 2001 and early 2002, the economy had a 12-month stretch in which it grew at a paltry 1.5% annual rate, sparking fears of a double-dip recession. In late 1991, growth waned after a recovery had started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past 12 months, the economy has gotten off to a faster start than in 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uncertainty is weighing on business executives. Maine-based <span class="companylink">Lincoln Paper and Tissue LLC</span> is running at full capacity right now, but it's not planning on expanding operations or adding to its 390 employees. "We're hunkered down and we're not contemplating any big moves of any sort right now," said CEO Keith Van Scotter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed officials believe the positives are likely to outweigh the worries and keep the recovery on track, putting the Fed in a position to begin raising short-term interest rates some time far down the road. A stumble would pose a dilemma for Fed officials. Interest rates are near zero, so they lack the traditional tool of interest-rate cuts to combat a faltering economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration is still pushing to advance an extension of unemployment benefits for laid-off workers now frozen in the Senate. House Democrats failed Tuesday in a renewed effort to pass an extension of unemployment benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has served as a reminder of the potential impact of removing federal support in a fragile economy. In May, after home-buyer tax credits expired, the numbers of new homes on which builders broke ground fell a seasonally adjusted 10%, and new home sales plunged 33% to an annualized rate of 300,000 -- the lowest level on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loss of stimulus funding is also hitting state and local governments, which are facing a combined budget deficit of some $137 billion this year and $144 billion in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some states have already gone through most of the federal education funds and have been cutting services and are firing tens of thousands of teachers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of America's hardest-hit housing markets still have legs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or so it appeared Tuesday, when an S&amp;P/Case-Shiller report for April showed healthy price increases in some states where valuations had fallen the most. Thanks to a government tax credit, the 20-city index enjoyed a 4% increase year-on-year. But San Diego and San Francisco fared far better, with prices up 12% and 18%, respectively. Even Phoenix beat the national average with a 5% rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The performance will be tough to sustain. First, states that indulged in cheap credit during the boom can expect foreclosures to provide plenty of supply for some time. Some 38% of subprime mortgages in California are in foreclosure or are more than 90 days delinquent, says the New York Federal Reserve. In Texas, where home prices have barely declined, the rate is 19%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while homes have become more affordable overall, that isn't enough to support price increases statewide, let alone nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of California's housing boom was driven by people migrating to distant suburbs for lower prices. But with prices in San Francisco 36% off their peaks, such areas have less appeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, sharp declines attract buyers eventually. But for Americans to have the confidence to buy, local economies and labor markets need to improve. California's unemployment rate stood at 12.4% in May, compared with 9.7% nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, states such as California and Arizona that extended the most subprime mortgages may have pulled demand forward. That means large numbers of younger people have already purchased homes. With much still to overcome, the worst-hit states are unlikely to be first in line for a sustainable recovery.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China</span>, China's largest bank, is rolling out a "large-loan" program targeting U.S. commercial real-estate owners in need of loans that exceed $100 million, a category most U.S. banks now avoid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move by Beijing-based ICBC, which is 70% owned by the Chinese government, is part of a broader push into the U.S. market and comes as China's regulators are encouraging domestic financial institutions to expand overseas. Although many U.S. and European banks continue to struggle with losses tied to real-estate loans made during the bubble years, ICBC is betting that property values have fallen enough that the bank's lending risks will be limited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is very close to the bottom," says Wu Bin, general manager of ICBC's New York branch, located in the Trump Tower on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue. Demand for new commercial-real-estate loans is huge as property owners face more than $1 trillion of maturing debt over the next five years that must be refinanced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts believe that ICBC could help fill a void left by the retreat of U.S.-based financial institutions. "Because of the concentration risk associated with large loans, that is a market many U.S. lenders shy away from," says Josh Scoville, director of research at real-estate-services firm <span class="companylink">CoStar Group Inc</span>. "A new entrant like ICBC certainly will be helpful."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, scores of foreign banks from Japan to Germany have been clobbered by their aggressive push into the U.S. property market during the boom times. Mr. Wu says ICBC will limit its risk by financing buildings with stable existing cash flows and lending to developers and investors with a solid track record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese bank is offering to lend no more than 65% of a property's value. During the frenzy, U.S. banks had lent more than 80% of a building's value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ICBC doesn't have a projection set for its loan book. "We will not force ourselves to do something we don't like or we don't know," Mr. Wu says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new entrant provides the latest evidence that foreign capital is funneling into U.S. real estate, lured by beaten-down property values and signs that the U.S. economy is coming out of the recession faster than those of other developed countries. <span class="companylink">China Investment Corp</span>., the $300 billion sovereign-wealth fund, also is looking to pile cash into U.S. real estate through investing with U.S. property-fund managers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, despite ICBC's size and profitability, challenges abound for a foreign bank to crack open a market also being courted by some large, well-capitalized domestic lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big U.S. banks like <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span>. are coming off the sidelines as they hope to market commercial property debt to yield-chasing investors by carving the debt into commercial-mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most U.S. banks are reluctant to lend more than $200 million to any single borrower because of the lingering difficulty in unloading risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ICBC says it could consider loans that are even higher than $500 million, and it intends to hold loans on its books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wu, a 15-year veteran of ICBC who has spent most of his time for the bank overseas and speaks fluent English, is open about the challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Here, no one knows who you are," says Mr. Wu, wearing a pin of the bank's logo that resembles the Chinese word for industry. To counter the lack of name recognition, Mr. Wu brought in two local real-estate experts—Proctor Wong, head of bank-services group at brokerage Newmark Knight Frank, and attorney Robert Koen at <span class="companylink">DLA Piper US LLP</span>— to devise the lending initiative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Messrs. Wu and Wong met in early 2008 when Mr. Wu was looking for space to house ICBC's New York outlet after the bank received federal approval to branch out into the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I told him to hold off signing the lease because values would continue to fall," Mr. Wong recalls, noting that Mr. Wu held off for "only a little while." The bank, eager to start business in the U.S. market, opened the branch in October 2008. But that conversation triggered a broader one about the U.S. real-estate market and its need for funding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We started to work together and to get training" for the ICBC team on things such as property valuations, Mr. Wong says, referring to Newmark Knight and <span class="companylink">DLA Piper</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adds Mr. Wu: "It took a year of preparation to start the platform. It's a team effort."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early this month, ICBC closed its first commercial-property loan in the U.S. It contributed $150 million to a $355 million loan made to a partnership led by private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Carlyle Group</span>. The venture used the loan to refinance the existing $325 million mortgage on 650 Madison Ave., a 27-story office-and-retail tower in midtown Manhattan. The rest of the loan was provided by <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Chung, a principal at Carlyle, says there was a "competitive" bidding process among lenders to provide financing to the building. "We understood ICBC had never done a real-estate deal in the U.S. But we were comfortable because of their size and global presence," he says, adding that Carlyle looks forward to "expanding the relationship globally."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of Connecticut single-family homes rose at the fastest pace in at least two decades last month while prices were essentially flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In total, 2,575 home sales closed in May, up 39% from 1,849 in May 2009. According to the Warren Group, that was the sharpest year-over-year increase in May since the company began compiling data in 1987. The Warren Group, a real-estate data provider and publisher based in Boston, said the median price in May was $240,000 compared with $239,900 in May 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jump in sales was attributed to pent-up demand, low interest rates and the federal home-buyer tax credit, which expired April 30. The company counts sales that were completed in May, which means the buyers actually signed the sales contracts months earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many housing economists believe that new purchase contracts in most cities across the country have plunged since April 30, as buyers no longer have the incentive of a federal tax break. But the effects of the tax credit are expected to show up in the sales data until the end of June, when sales must be completed to qualify for the tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connecticut condominium sales rose 43% in May when compared with a year earlier, and the median condo price declined 0.59% to $169,000. Condo sales in 2010 through May were up 33% over the year-earlier period.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Fear of a Stall Hits Market; Stocks, Bond Yields Dive on Bad News From Consumers, China, European Banks</span>
</div><div class="author">By Jon Hilsenrath                And Mark Whitehouse   </div><div>1033 words</div><div>28 June 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American stocks and bond yields fell sharply as concerns mounted that the economy might be in for a slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.6% back below 10000 on slumping U.S. consumer confidence, the downward revision of a Chinese economic indicator and worries about the health of Europe's banks. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes fell below 3% to their lowest level since April 2009, a sign investors were seeking out safe investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board, a non-profit research group, reported Tuesday that consumer confidence dropped in June, wiping out gains from the previous two months. The index fell to 52.9, down sharply from a downwardly revised 62.7 the month before, with an increasing number of households saying jobs were "hard to get."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in the day, the Conference Board downwardly revised a leading indicator of Chinese economic growth. Investors were also jittery about the expiration of a European Central Bank program to extend 12-month financing to European lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A double-dip recession is still widely viewed as unlikely. But the drop in confidence is just the latest sign suggesting the economy could lose steam in the second half of 2010 and perhaps grow more slowly than in the first half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak job creation is a central part of the problem. Friday's report by the Labor Department on the job market in June is expected to show private-sector hiring perked up in June as the Census Bureau laid off temporary workers. But gathering signs of economic headwinds suggest future job growth could be slim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among these headwinds: signs that the housing sector is heading into a new downturn, and financial conditions that have turned less supportive of growth as stock prices decline, the dollar strengthens and credit markets struggle. The global backdrop has grown more uncertain as European governments such as the U.K. and Germany turn their attention to closing budget deficits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are reasons for optimism. Individual incomes are rising and supportive of steady growth in consumer spending. Corporate cash flows are strong and supportive of investment and hiring. The industrial recovery, though it could lose some momentum as inventory rebuilding slows, has been robust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy grew at a 2.7% annual rate in the first quarter, and economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal on average believe it grew at a 3.6% pace in the second quarter, which ends Wednesday. The consensus is for a modest 3% growth rate in the second half, but some forecasters call that optimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm getting more pessimistic about the ability for the economy to reaccelerate in the fourth quarter and in the first half of 2011," says Paul Kasriel, chief economist at the Northern Trust bank in Chicago. He expects the economy to grow at a rate of around 2.5% in the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Barack Obama expressed optimism about the outlook after a morning meeting with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. Mr. Obama said he and Mr. Bernanke "share the view that the economy is strengthening," noting that the U.S. has gone from losing 750,000 jobs per month last year to five months of job growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing weighing on the economy is the housing market, which, after stabilizing, is weakening again as government support disappears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Petit, owner of M&amp;M Contractors in Salem, Mass., saw an uptick in roofing and other business in March, April and May, as people did storm-related repairs and fixed up homes for sale. In June, though, business has been down about 20% from a year earlier. "I was pretty busy but I didn't think it was going to last," he says. "Unfortunately, I was right."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pauses aren't uncommon early in a recovery. After rebounding from recession in late 2001 and early 2002, the economy had a 12-month stretch in which it grew at a paltry 1.5% annual rate, sparking fears of a double-dip recession. In late 1991, growth waned after a recovery had started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past 12 months, the economy has gotten off to a faster start than in 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uncertainty is weighing on business executives. Maine-based <span class="companylink">Lincoln Paper and Tissue LLC</span> is running at full capacity right now, but it's not planning on expanding operations or adding to its 390 employees. "We're hunkered down and we're not contemplating any big moves of any sort right now," said CEO Keith Van Scotter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed officials believe the positives are likely to outweigh the worries and keep the recovery on track, putting the Fed in a position to begin raising short-term interest rates some time far down the road. A stumble would pose a dilemma for Fed officials. Interest rates are near zero, so they lack the traditional tool of interest-rate cuts to combat a faltering economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration is still pushing to advance an extension of unemployment benefits for laid-off workers now frozen in the Senate. House Democrats failed Tuesday in a renewed effort to pass an extension of unemployment benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has served as a reminder of the potential impact of removing federal support in a fragile economy. In May, after home-buyer tax credits expired, the numbers of new homes on which builders broke ground fell a seasonally adjusted 10%, and new home sales plunged 33% to an annualized rate of 300,000—the lowest level on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loss of stimulus funding is also hitting state and local governments, which are facing a combined budget deficit of some $137 billion this year and $144 billion in 2011. Some states have already gone through most of the federal education funds earmarked for the 2009-1010 and 2010-2011 school years. With no more money forthcoming, they've been cutting services and are firing tens of thousands of teachers.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Good Schools, Bad Real Estate; Despite the housing slump, house hunting in good school districts frustrates parents who often have to settle for less house.</span>
</div><div class="author">By Sarah Max   </div><div>1563 words</div><div>25 June 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, the sacrifices parents make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kiely and John Adams began their house hunt this spring with grand plans to upgrade from their small home in Cary, N.C., to a larger, four-bedroom house—preferably with an office and a bonus room—about 25 miles away in Chapel Hill, where Kiely plans on starting a Ph.D. program next fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They could have gotten all that and more for their $415,000 budget if they kept their search on the outskirts of Chapel Hill. But, determined to stay within the boundaries of Chapel Hill's highly-regarded school district, the parents of 5-year-old twins, Megan and Bevin, and 4-year-old Sean trudged ahead in what they dubbed "an exercise in compromise." Even when they did find a house that showed promise, it was usually snapped up before they could take a closer look. "Most houses seemed to come and go, come and go," Mr. Adams says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Family, Two Houses</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's supposed to be a buyer's market. Yet, for parents determined to buy in areas associated with top schools, those bargains may be harder to come by. When housing markets go south, "areas with exceptional schools tend to hold their value better than the market overall," says Michael Sklarz, president of Collateral Analytics, a Honolulu-based firm that specializes in real estate data analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Chapel Hill, where the Adams family was looking, the average single-family home price, based on price per square foot, has declined about 4.8% since the market peaked in 2007, according to Collateral Analytics, but houses there still command about a 48% premium, per square foot, to homes in the Raleigh-Cary metro area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other parts the country, home prices have dropped in areas with good schools, but the declines are typically nowhere near the levels in their surrounding metro areas. In Irvine, Calif., a city that regularly gets national attention for its quality schools, average price per square foot has fallen 18% since its 2006 peak, but prices in the greater metro area surrounding Irvine fell 33%. The same goes for Edina, Minn., where prices per square foot are down about 14% since their peak, versus 27% for the greater Minneapolis area. And in the brainy town of Andover, Mass., prices are down just 4%, versus more than 16% for the Boston metro division.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are several factors at play, says Mr. Sklarz. Areas with good schools tend to be more affluent and were less susceptible to the sub-prime mortgage debacle so saw fewer foreclosures. What's more, homes associated with great schools generally sell faster, in good markets and bad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this comes as no surprise to the real estate agents who work with education-obsessed parents. "Schools have a huge impact on home values," says Kathy Beacham, a real estate broker in Raleigh. When schools in her own well-to-do neighborhood were redistricted three years ago, the value of her million-dollar home dropped more than $150,000. "A good education has always been important but I don't remember looking at the numbers like parents do today," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then again, the numbers have never been so widely available. State assessments, independent ratings from websites like GreatSchools and Education.com and annual magazine rankings of America's top high schools have not only made it easy for parents to factor school test scores and parent-teacher ratios into their buying decisions, they've cemented the relationship between home prices and school quality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Florida rolled out its statewide grading system in 1999, the real estate market took note. According to research by David Figlio, who is now a professor of education, social policy and economics at Northwestern University, an A-rated school in Gainesville added about $10,000 to the value of a home there versus a B school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once a school is graded, the gap often grows. Strong ratings lead to better community support, which in turn leads to better schools. Today, the difference between an A school and B school might easily be $50,000 on a $300,000 house, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That phenomenon isn't lost on residents of Bellevue, Wash., a Seattle suburb that is home to some of the best schools in the state. "I don't think there's ever been a school levy on the ballot here that's been turned down," says broker Michael Orbino. Even residents who don't have school-age children tend to stand behind the schools. It's not altruism; it's economics. All things being equal, homes in the Bellevue school district fetch as much as a 15% premium to those just outside of it, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But there's more to it than that," says Mr. Orbino. "Because the land is worth so much more in Bellevue, builders tend to build more expensive homes here," making the school district that much more expensive to begin with. By Mr. Orbino's estimate, the prices for single-family homes are down about 10% since the market peak. "But it isn't a catch-all," he says. Prices for ultra-luxury homes and condos, which generally aren't influenced by schools, are down 30% to 40%, he says. So while prices per square foot in Bellevue have fallen slightly more than the Seattle market overall, prices for more family-friendly abodes haven't necessarily seen the same declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stabilizing effect of good schools is welcome news for those who already own property in school boundaries, but it makes it tough for parents to trade up to better homes. John and Kiely Adams considered themselves lucky to have found a three-bedroom home in a Chapel Hill neighborhood they liked and at a price in their budget. But, alas, they were forced to back out of the deal when their current home came up short in the appraisal. With their daughters' first day of kindergarten fast approaching, the couple will stay put for now and start the process over again next spring. "We don't want them to start kindergarten only to yank them out two months later," says Mr. Adams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Left with few other options, some parents get creative. Bellevue school administrators have seen all kinds of tactics for skirting the district's policy that students spend at least four nights a week within boundary lines. Common ploys include using a family member's address or taking over a resident's utility bill, one of the documents used as proof of residency. The school district has uncovered 35 cases of enrollment fraud this year alone. Other families jump school boundaries by spending four nights a week in a small apartment and going home to a bigger house in another town for the weekends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, Daniel and Dee Shin used an inheritance from Mr. Shin's father to pay $410,000 for the "cheapest house they could afford" in Bellevue for the sole purpose of securing a spot in the school district for their then 11-year-old daughter, Kayla. The 900-square-foot circa-1955 rambler is "beat up and not insulated very well," says Mr. Shin, adding that he assumed that paying property taxes on the house would be enough to satisfy the school district's residency requirements even if the family actually resided in a 2,326-square-foot, four-bedroom home in the nearby town of Renton. Their new neighbors in Bellevue, evidently, didn't see it that way. They reported the Shins to the school district, and the district gave them an ultimatum: move into the Bellevue district by the time Kayla registers for high school in February, or start the following school year in another district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision was clear for the Shins. They plan to spend the summer insulating the Bellevue home and doing their best to make it livable. Come January, they'll move into that house, and their extended family will move into the house in Renton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Shins considered just sending Kayla to a private school, but Mr. Shins says that suggestion triggered "on demand tears" from Kayla, who doesn't relish the idea of going to a different high school than her middle-school pals. After all the trouble the couple went through to get Kayla into Bellevue schools, they're determined to see her graduate from Newport High School, which, Mr. Shin is quick to point out, is consistently ranked among the best in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the father of three children ages 11, 14 and 16, Northwestern's Mr. Figlio understands the dilemma parents face. When he and his family relocated from Gainesville, Fla., to Evanston, Ill., in 2008, Mr. Figlio vetted the middle schools before making a decision about where exactly he and his family would live. For parents struggling with how to get their kids into the "best" schools at a price they can afford, he recommends considering test scores, state ratings and the like—but not getting too hung up on enrolling your child in an A+ school at all costs when a B+ school might actually be a better fit, academically and financially.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Emmeline Zhao   </div><div>417 words</div><div>24 June 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes plunged in May following the expiration of special tax credits for home buyers, underscoring how much those subsidies fueled sales in previous months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales fell 32.7% from April to a record low seasonally adjusted annual rate of 300,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Compared with a year ago, sales fell 18.3%. New-home sales are calculated based on the number of contracts signed to acquire homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp drop comes after home buyers rushed to the market before tax credits expired at the end of April. The report doesn't necessarily indicate a weaker recovery, as the subsidies may have pulled forward sales that would have come later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales increased in March and April, by a downward-revised 12.1% and 14.7%, respectively. When those increases are averaged with the decline in May, sales for that three-month period are comparable to the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a concern that even with very low interest rates, you're seeing there's an inability of home sales to move up at all in the past year," said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span>. "But there's reason to believe going forward things wouldn't be quite as bad as they are in May."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of new homes available for sale dipped 0.5% to 213,000, the lowest level since 1970. The national inventory of homes available, which includes existing as well as new homes, jumped to an 8.5 months supply, up from 5.8 months in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expiration of the tax incentive and an excess supply of existing homes for sale also led to a decline in new-home construction and applications for home-buying loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Mungo, president of the Home Builders Association of South Carolina, cut the number of new homes he broke ground on to 55 or 60 in May from about 90 in April, to accommodate changes in demand. "We're just seeing the hangover from the tax credit and I fully did not expect to have good sales months in May or June," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales fell more than 25% in the South, and all other regions also saw sharp declines. The median price of a new home sold in May was $200,900, 9.6% lower than a year earlier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress is planting the seeds of the next big bank bailout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Attention is focused on the House-Senate conference on a once-in-a-generation rewrite of the rules of finance. Meanwhile, a provision added, almost unnoticed, to a help-small-business bill that passed the House last week would allow all but the 100 largest banks to pretend they haven't made bad loans. The goal is to prompt them to lend more readily to small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The provision would permit more than 7,800 banks, with nearly $3 trillion in assets among them, to spread losses on bad real estate loans over six to 10 years instead of recognizing reality immediately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This wink-wink accounting, which would allow banks to act as if they have bigger capital cushions than they do, is a remake of an old movie: the savings-and-loan horror show of the 1980s and the Japanese banking monster of the 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allowing a bank that is broke or near-broke to pretend otherwise in the hope that temporarily depressed commercial real estate prices will eventually rise sounds nice. But history shows that too many such bankers realize the only survival strategy is to make more risky loans and pray they're paid back. If they aren't, well, the government deposit-insurance fund, not the shareholders, gets the tab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner thinks this is an awful idea. "Could increase costs for the taxpayer by raising the likely losses from future bank failures," he wrote to House leaders. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke thinks this is an awful idea: "Banks that are allowed to carry these losses do not engage in sound lending."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comptroller of the Currency John Dugan thinks this is an awful idea: "Will undermine the efforts of … regulators to shore up investor confidence in the banking system." Sheila Bair, chairman of the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, thinks it is an awful idea: "Encourages … executives to take excess risks with the hope that these bets will pay off. … The taxpayer remains liable for any losses, but the shareholders profit if these investments result in gains."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When I get a call from Tim Geithner or I hear from Ben Bernanke, you bet I sit up and take notice," says Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D., Colo.), chief sponsor of the provision. "But after all the testimony I've heard—after my own experiences as a lawyer representing banks, insurance companies, real estate companies, which gives me some perspective that maybe they don't have—I think this is an approach that we need for these smaller bankers and smaller businesses, to get everybody back on their feet and creating jobs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Perlmutter and his allies—Democrats Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, Steve Kagan of Wisconsin and Ron Klein of Florida—don't want to cause a costly banking crisis, of course. They are responding to yelps from small businesses that say they can't get credit and managers of small banks who say they can't make loans because bank examiners are forcing them to value real estate at today's improbably low prices. Small banks, they say, didn't cause the global financial earthquake, but they felt it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those aftershocks are still being felt by small businesses and small banks all across the country," Mr. Perlmutter says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration's response: Put $30 billion in taxpayer capital into these community banks so they have the wherewithal to lend. The House has OK'd this; the Senate hasn't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not enough for the small-bank lobby, whose power derives from the presence of at least a few community banks in every congressional district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're talking about banks that are well run, well managed, victims of their local area where the real estate market has just tanked," says Cam Fine of the Independent Community Bankers of America. "Poorly run banks are going to fail anyway," he says, and this won't change that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Backers cite precedent, a 1980s analog. But that initiative was restricted to really small banks, deemed "well-managed" by regulators, that lent heavily to farmers. Only 334 banks with total assets of $13.5 billion participated, far fewer than would be eligible under the House bill. (Of those, the FDIC says, 20% failed eventually.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's another precedent: The Congressional Budget Office estimates that more than half the $212 billion (in today's dollars) cost of the savings-and-loan rescue is attributable to letting thrifts live instead of closing them when they became insolvent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The political dynamic here is clear. Big banks are popular villains; small banks are heroes. Big banks—think <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>.—are too big to fail; small banks aren't. Big business arouses suspicions among the public; small business seems friendly and entrepreneurial. Big companies can borrow from the bond market when banks are picky; small companies cannot, and thus can't expand and hire readily if they want to. Elected politicians want to do something, anything, to help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But pretending helped get us into this mess: pretending that putting enough subprime loans into one security made it AAA, that people without incomes could make mortgage payments, that house prices would never fall across the country, that the CEOs of gargantuan financial institutions could manage risks they didn't fully understand, that supposedly sophisticated investors understood what they were buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pretending that banks haven't lost a bundle on commercial real estate loans does not seem a smart way out of this mess.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- New-home sales in the U.S. plunged in May to a record low, as buyers faced a lackluster job market without a long-time government subsidy for purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales fell 32.7% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 300,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, in an unpleasant report that showed how the end of government support could affect the U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wall Street, stock prices began falling after the reported home sales decline, which exceeded what had been dire expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We would be lying if we said the size of the drop was not shocking," <span class="companylink">Miller Tabak</span> analyst Dan Greenhaus said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector is a sore spot within the broader economy, which suffered painfully weak job growth and floundering retail sales in May. Investors have been seeking a haven amid worries about the economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the U.S. Treasury sold $40 billion two-year notes. Bids submitted for the auction were 3.45 times the amount of the offer, the highest since October 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in May were down across all four regions. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had estimated sales would tank 20.6% to 400,000 because of the April 30 end of a tax credit for certain buyers that was enacted in February 2009 and extended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The level of 300,000 homes sold was the lowest since the government begin compiling this data in 1963. The 32.7% decrease was also a record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp drop followed two big increases that reflected buyers rushing to market before the tax credit expired. April sales rose 14.7% to 446,000, revised down from an originally reported 14.8% to 504,000. March sales climbed 12.1% to 389,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year over year, sales were down 18.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for a new home decreased, year over year, in May by 9.6%, to $200,900 from May 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"By the fall, we expect the very favorable affordability picture to start pulling people back into the market, but the next few months are likely to be very grim," <span class="companylink">High Frequency Economics</span> analyst Ian Shepherdson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of new homes slid 0.5% in May to an estimated 213,000 homes for sale, from 214,000 at the end of April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But because of the severe sales drop, the number of months' supply at the current sales rate jumped to 8.5 from a revised 5.8 in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, new-home sales plunged 23.9% in the Midwest, 53.2% in the West, 25.4% in the South, and 33.3% in the Northeast.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes plunged in May following the expiration of special tax credits for home buyers, underscoring how much those subsidies fueled sales in previous months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales fell 32.7% from April to a record low seasonally adjusted annual rate of 300,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Compared with a year ago, sales fell 18.3%. New-home sales are calculated based on the number of contracts signed to acquire homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp drop comes after home buyers rushed to the market before tax credits expired at the end of April. The report doesn't necessarily indicate a weaker recovery, as the subsidies may have pulled forward sales that would have come later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales increased in March and April, by a downward-revised 12.1% and 14.7%, respectively. When those increases are averaged with the decline in May, sales for that three-month period are comparable to the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a concern that even with very low interest rates, you're seeing there's an inability of home sales to move up at all in the past year," said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span>. "But there's reason to believe going forward things wouldn't be quite as bad as they are in May."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of new homes available for sale dipped 0.5% to 213,000, the lowest level since 1970. The national inventory of homes available, which includes existing as well as new homes, jumped to an 8.5 months supply, up from 5.8 months in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expiration of the tax incentive and an excess supply of existing homes for sale also led to a decline in new-home construction and applications for home-buying loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Mungo, president of the Home Builders Association of South Carolina, cut the number of new homes he broke ground on to 55 or 60 in May from about 90 in April, to accommodate changes in demand. "We're just seeing the hangover from the tax credit and I fully did not expect to have good sales months in May or June," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales fell more than 25% in the South, and all other regions also saw sharp declines. The median price of a new home sold in May was $200,900, 9.6% lower than a year earlier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG—Asian markets mostly fell Wednesday after a drop in U.S. existing home sales hurt sentiment, with softer commodity prices dragging on material stocks while Chinese steelmakers were hurt by Beijing's decision to scrap an export tax rebate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan's Nikkei Stock Average fell 1.9% and Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 skidded 1.6%, China's Shanghai Composite gave up 0.7%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.2%, South Korea's Kospi lost 0.3% and Taiwan's Taiex slid 0.4%. India's Sensex inched up 0.2% and Singapore's Straits Times slid 0.4% by afternoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained 55 points in screen trade. The Dow Jones fell 149 points overnight, after U.S. May home sales unexpectedly fell 2.2% as high joblessness in the U.S. offset the fading benefits of a tax credit for buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The optimism we saw a few days ago has been snuffed by that weak U.S. home sales data," said BBY senior institutional trader Peter Copeland in Sydney. "But if you believe the container volumes data coming out of China, they suggest the global consumer is back. I think we will be in a holding pattern before tonight's [Federal Open Market Committee] decision and policy statement."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy stocks declined, weighed down by weaker crude-oil prices and losses for their U.S. counterparts. U.S. energy stocks led Wall Street lower on expectations of legal wrangling between the industry and the Obama administration over the deepwater drilling moratorium. A federal judge in Louisiana Tuesday ruled against the ban, but the White House responded by saying it would immediately appeal the injunction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil Search fell 2.2% and Santos gave up 3% in Sydney, <span class="companylink">Inpex Corp</span>. lost 2.9% in Tokyo, <span class="companylink">PetroChina Co</span>. slid 0.7% in Hong Kong and Energy Development Corp. dropped 1.1% in Manila.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Woodside Petroleum</span> fell 1.4% after the company flagged a possible timetable delay and cost increases at its 13 billion Australian dollar ($11.3 billion) Pluto liquefied natural gas development in Western Australia. A dozen crane and forklift workers have been on strike over pay and conditions since April 28 and Woodside said in late March that its first LNG target could be missed if the action continued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weaker base metal prices also hurt mining and metal companies, with BHP Billiton dropping 1.3% and <span class="companylink">Rio Tinto</span> losing 2.2% in Sydney and <span class="companylink">Sterlite Industries</span> dropping 1.7% in Mumbai trading. But gold miners advanced on firmer spot prices, with <span class="companylink">Newcrest Mining</span> adding 0.8% in Sydney and Zhaojin Mining Industry Co. gaining 1.4% in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese steel makers came under selling pressure after the Ministry of Finance said Tuesday it would scrap an export tax rebate on a variety of commodities, including steel and non-ferrous goods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The cancellation of the export tax rebate effectively raises the export tax on these products, hurting the prospects of the metal firms, but the impact would be capped as companies start to limit volume growth," said Wang Junqing, an analyst from Guosen Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Baoshan Iron &amp; Steel Co</span>. dropped 2.7% in Shanghai, while Angang Steel Co. shares fell 2.4% in Shenzhen and 3.3% in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Seoul, "the market is returning some of the recent gains after it overreacted on Monday to China's calls for greater yuan flexibility," said Min Sang-il, an analyst at E*Trade Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most technology and auto stocks were weaker with <span class="companylink">Samsung Electronics</span> down 1.4% and <span class="companylink">Hyundai Motor Co</span>. shedding 3.1%, while <span class="companylink">Korean Air Lines</span> rose 1.1%, extending Tuesday's gains on hopes for strong overseas travel demand in the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japanese exporters also dropped after the decline on Wall Street, with <span class="companylink">Honda Motor Co</span>. dropping 1.5%, <span class="companylink">Nissan Motor Co</span>. off 1.8% and Fanuc 1.9% lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, New Zealand's NZX 50 ended flat and Philippine shares declined 0.3%, while Indonesian shares lost 1.1% and Thailand's SET Index inched up 0.1% by late afternoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In foreign exchange markets, appetite for risk was damped by losses in the stock markets as well as the disappointing U.S. home sales data. Traders were also cautious ahead of the results of the Federal Reserve's policy-setting meeting due later in the global day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro was at $1.2296, compared with $1.2277 in late New York trade Tuesday, and at 111.26 yen from 110.98 yen. The dollar was at 90.50 yen from 90.39 yen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The greenback was caught in a "sideways shuffle," said Bank of New Zealand Strategist Mike Jones. He said that the initial euphoria surrounding China's decision to relax the yuan's exchange rate has "faded noticeably" and a "wealth of worrying credit news rekindled fears over the European banking sector, weighing on the euro."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier Wednesday, the People's Bank of China set the dollar central parity rate at 6.8102 yuan from 6.7980 yuan Tuesday, suggesting that Beijing's weekend decision to allow greater exchange rate flexibility didn't mean it's a one-way bet on the yuan. The dollar was at 6.8033 yuan from 6.8136 yuan late Tuesday in Shanghai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jones added that the markets were firmly focused on the upcoming Fed rate decision. "We suspect a downbeat statement from the Fed would actually support the U.S. dollar, owing to its safe-haven status."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japanese government bonds were higher, lifted by the Tokyo stock market's losses as well as U.S. Treasurys' gains Tuesday. The yield on the cash 10-year JGB was down 1.5 basis points at 1.170%. Lead September JGB futures were up 0.10 at 140.92 points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">August Nymex crude-oil futures were down 36 cents at $77.49 per barrel on Globex, after losing 76 cents Tuesday. Spot gold was at $1,242.80 per troy ounce, up $4.20 from late New York trade.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK—Gold futures settled lower as appetite for perceived riskier assets dwindled after disappointing U.S. home sales data and on skittishness ahead of the results of the Federal Reserve meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most actively traded contract for August delivery ended down $6, or 0.5%, at $1,234.80 on the Comex division of the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government data showed that U.S. May new home sales fell 32.7% from April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 300,000 homes, another blow to hopes for a strong recovery and to the growth-sensitive commodities such as copper and oil that depend on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold's consistent rise in recent weeks came as traders added to positive bets across commodities markets, said Michael Gross, a broker and futures analyst with OptionSellers.com. Mr. Gross said the housing data sent those buyers seeking safety elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold is "acting like a regular commodity," he said. "People are starting to reconsider whether we're in a full-swing recovery here. That's putting some weakness on metals in general."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While gold is often seen as a safe-haven investment in times of economic uncertainty, it is also sometimes traded along with growth-sensitive assets as so-called risk plays based on bets about future price action, which can be volatile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the gold pit closed, the Federal Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged, as expected. But Fed officials downgraded their outlook for the U.S. economy, indicating that short-term interest rates could remain at a record low until next year to support growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are "worried about the Fed's actions," said Tom Dyson, editor and market analyst for the investment newsletter DailyWealth.com, ahead of the Fed announcement. "I don't think there's much chance of a move in interest rates, but it's the message that gold traders are looking at."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dyson said indications of coming rate increases would strengthen the dollar, sending investors who see gold as an alternative currency away from the metal. A stronger dollar also tends to pressure dollar-denominated gold by making it more expensive for buyers using other currencies, which can hamper demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold fell as low as $1,225.20, down more than 2% from its record settlement prices at the end of last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections are not uncommon after gold has set records in the last year. Futures prices fell by 10% after hitting new highs in December and dropped by about 5% after rising to records again in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Precious metals with more industrial applications all fell harder than gold Wednesday. Silver, platinum and palladium tend to see increases in demand during times of global growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comex September silver settled down 44.3 cents, or 2.3%, at $18.504 an ounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nymex October platinum settled $27.40, or 1.7% lower, at $1,574.70 an ounce. September palladium settled down $15.60, or 3.2%, to $474.35 an ounce.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty   </div><div>562 words</div><div>23 June 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing analysts have grown gloomier about the outlook for U.S. home prices as sales slump, a new survey shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly report by MacroMarkets LLC[http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/June2010Survey20100622.pdf], due for release Wednesday, found that 56% of the 106 economists and other analysts surveyed expect home prices to decline this year. That is up from 40% a month ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors measured completed resales of homes in May at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 5.66 million units, down 2.2% from April, though up 19% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal tax credits of as much as $8,000 for home buyers spurred sales in recent months. To qualify for those credits, buyers had to sign purchase contracts by April 30. The Realtors' data for May reflect completions of sales, most of which were based on contracts signed in March or April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since April 30, new purchase contracts have plunged as buyers no longer have the incentive of a federal tax break, builders and real estate agents say. Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors, estimated that contracts signed in May were 10% to 15% below the weak level of a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ronald Peltier, chief executive officer of <span class="companylink">HomeServices of America Inc</span>., which owns real estate brokers in 21 states, said new home-purchase contracts in May and June so far are down about 20% from a year earlier. The tax credit accelerated sales that otherwise would have occurred later in the year, Mr. Peltier said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terry Loebs, managing director of MacroMarkets, a developer of investment and hedging products based in Madison, N.J., said he believes housing analysts generally have grown more cautious because of the weak national employment data reported in early June and the sharp drop in sales and housing starts since April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the economists who reduced their forecasts for home prices this year was Scott Anderson of <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're seeing a loss of momentum" in housing demand since the</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">expiration of the tax credit, he said, and that lull could last until next spring. The job market remains weak, he added, and foreclosed homes continue to weigh on the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the Commerce Department reported that May construction starts on single-family homes fell 17% to an annual rate of 468,000, the lowest level in a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have slowed construction because sales in May were "horrible" and June so far has been only slightly better, said John Burns, a housing-industry consultant in Irvine, Calif. He expects a gradual improvement over the rest of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysts surveyed by MacroMarkets on average expect home prices, as measured by the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller national index, to decline about 1.4% this year, then rise 1.3% in 2011 and 2.7% in 2012.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billionaire investor and <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> co-founder Paul G. Allen has spent roughly two decades and millions of dollars amassing real estate, primarily in Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But last year, Mr. Allen's <span class="companylink">Vulcan Inc</span>. investment firm began intensifying its search for deals outside the Pacific Northwest, branching out into the beaten-down property markets of Southern California and Arizona.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that quest has yielded its first deal: Vulcan is paying $35 million in cash for an empty eight-story office building completed last year in downtown Tempe, Ariz. The transaction signals a two-pronged strategy change for Vulcan. The firm is both mixing more geographic diversity into its property portfolio and moving toward buying existing buildings rather than building from scratch, as the firm has typically done in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Historically, we haven't been a significant buyer of existing buildings," says Ada M. Healey, vice president of real estate at Vulcan, who heads up Vulcan's real-estate division and came to the firm in 2001 from ING Clarion Partners. Buying office buildings at some of today's lower prices makes more sense than new construction, because "there are not a lot of tenants who are willing to pay rents that will justify new buildings," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vulcan is known for ill-fated technology investments that fit into Mr. Allen's earlier vision of a "wired world." The firm lost enormous sums on investments in companies like <span class="companylink">Charter Communications Inc</span>. But the firm also has invested large sums in real estate and a range of other asset classes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vulcan faces competition in its real-estate strategy because numerous other deep-pocketed investors have been chasing distressed real estate, while owners have resisted selling at today's discounted prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've taken a run at a couple other assets," Ms. Healey says. "There's a tremendous amount of capital in the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Allen, 57 years old, authorized the Tempe acquisition and took part in the decision to move into new markets such as Phoenix that Vulcan believes are poised for a rebound, Ms. Healey says. The Tempe Gateway building was built by <span class="companylink">Opus Corp</span>.'s <span class="companylink">Opus West</span> unit, which filed for bankruptcy protection last year. The sale was part of the bankruptcy process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 260,000-square-foot building is on a main artery of Tempe near a light rail stop and close to Arizona State University. The building squares with Vulcan's interest in urban infill locations close to public transportation, Ms. Healey says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vulcan, founded in 1986, is headed up by Mr. Allen's sister Jody Allen. Firm officials say Vulcan's real-estate portfolio is more than 95% leased and comprises more than $2 billion in assets in the Seattle area, where Mr. Allen is one of the city's largest property owners. Vulcan owns nearly 60 acres of land in the city's South Lake Union neighborhood. That also is where Vulcan scored one of its more recent real-estate wins: a deal to build a new headquarters complex for online retailer <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vulcan has also made some missteps. In the 1990s, Vulcan built and helped finance the Rose Garden arena in Portland, Ore., home to Mr. Allen's Portland Trail Blazers NBA basketball team. In 2004, the Vulcan affiliate that owned the arena filed for bankruptcy protection, and the Rose Garden was taken back by lenders, though Vulcan repurchased the arena in 2007. "There just weren't a lot of very wealthy people willing to buy skyboxes," says Randall Pozdena, managing director of ECONorthwest, an economic consultancy based in Eugene, Ore. A spokeswoman for Vulcan says the company treats the asset as a basketball asset, not real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betting on a Phoenix real-estate recovery is still something of a gamble. Tempe, part of the Phoenix metropolitan area and home to the corporate headquarters of <span class="companylink">U.S. Airways Group</span>, has seen the vacancy rate of its Class-A office space soar to about 40% in the first quarter, including sublease space, from about 29% one year earlier, as the market has struggled to absorb newly constructed buildings, according to Cassidy Turley BRE Commercial, a real-estate-services firm in Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the average price paid for office space per square foot in Tempe fell to about $102 last year, from a peak of $265 in 2008, according to <span class="companylink">CoStar Group Inc</span>., a real-estate-research firm. But Jim Fijan, an executive vice president with <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> who represented the group of lenders selling the Tempe building, said as many as eight local and national companies bid on the property. He estimates the building, acquired for about $135 a square foot, would cost about $225 a square foot to construct.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>560 words</div><div>23 June 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing analysts have grown gloomier about the outlook for U.S. home prices as sales slump, a new survey shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly report by MacroMarkets LLC, due for release Wednesday, found that 56% of the 106 economists and other analysts surveyed expect home prices to decline this year. That is up from 40% a month ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors measured completed resales of homes in May at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 5.66 million units, down 2.2% from April, though up 19% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal tax credits of as much as $8,000 for home buyers spurred sales in recent months. To qualify for those credits, buyers had to sign purchase contracts by April 30. The Realtors' data for May reflect completions of sales, most of which were based on contracts signed in March or April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since April 30, new purchase contracts have plunged as buyers no longer have the incentive of a federal tax break, builders and real-estate agents say. Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors, estimated that contracts signed in May were 10% to 15% below the weak level of a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ronald Peltier, chief executive officer of <span class="companylink">HomeServices of America Inc</span>., which owns real-estate brokerages in 21 states, said new home-purchase contracts in May and June so far are down about 20% from a year earlier. The tax credit accelerated sales that otherwise would have occurred later in the year, Mr. Peltier said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terry Loebs, managing director of MacroMarkets, a developer of investment and hedging products based in Madison, N.J., said he believes housing analysts generally have grown more cautious because of the weak national employment data reported in early June and the sharp drop in sales and housing starts since April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the economists who reduced their forecasts for home prices this year was Scott Anderson of <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're seeing a loss of momentum" in housing demand since the expiration of the tax credit, he said, and that lull could last until next spring. The job market remains weak, he added, and foreclosed homes continue to weigh on the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the Commerce Department reported that May construction starts on single-family homes fell 17% to an annual rate of 468,000, the lowest level in a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have slowed construction because sales in May were "horrible" and June so far has been only slightly better, said John Burns, a housing-industry consultant in Irvine, Calif. He expects a gradual improvement over the rest of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysts surveyed by MacroMarkets on average expect home prices, as measured by the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller national index, to decline about 1.4% this year, then rise 1.3% in 2011 and 2.7% in 2012. For the five years ending Dec. 31, 2014, they see a rise of 10.5%. As of Dec. 31, the index was down about 28% from its peak level in mid-2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> said its monthly house-price index in April was up 0.8% on a seasonally adjusted basis from March. The index was down 1.5% from a year earlier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A housing double-dip? More like a long, slow melt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is likely to be the takeaway from this week's slew of housing reports. Tuesday could be a bright spot, with the National Association of Realtors expected to say existing-home sales rose some 5% from April to May to an annualized rate of about 6 million units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would be the third monthly increase in a row and the highest sales pace since November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that is unlikely to cement faith in the housing recovery. Sales have been juiced twice now by the government's home-buyer tax credits, which expired April 30 for contracts and on June 30 for closings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the Commerce Department on Wednesday is expected to say new-home sales dropped 20% last month, according to economists surveyed by Dow Jones, to an annualized 400,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would largely unwind sharp gains recorded in March and April ahead of the contract deadline. Already last week, Commerce said new home construction dropped by 10% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is far from clear this marks the start of a "double-dip" for the housing market. The hardest-hit segment—new home sales—is a small part of the market, accounting for just 8% of homes sold in April even with the tax credit's lift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plus, its weakness should dissuade further building activity—a positive as it should stop inventory of unsold houses swelling even further. And the hit to overall gross domestic product is likely to be small: Residential investment accounts for just 2.4% of GDP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the much larger market of existing-home sales should hold up better. For one, existing homes run about 15%-20% cheaper on average than newly built ones. Sales, while likely to slump this summer, should firm toward year-end if the labor market continues its gradual improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And affordability continues to improve: falling prices and historically low mortgage rates have lowered typical monthly payments to about 15% of household income, down from 21% in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices may well slide further as the market searches for a floor. But a 5% decline, say, over the next year or two isn't exactly a double-dip, and should ultimately support a healthier recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers shouldn't get in the way.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ethan Smith   </div><div>1274 words</div><div>21 June 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly a year after Michael Jackson's death, the managers overseeing his estate have stabilized its precarious financial situation, but at least one major liability still looms: a $300 million loan due at the end of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to the surge of fan interest sparked by Mr. Jackson's death, the singer generated an estimated $200 million posthumously, allowing the estate to pay off tens of millions of dollars in debt and avert foreclosure on the suburban Los Angeles complex where the singer's mother lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Mr. Jackson's death last June 25, his businesses have been run by the singer's longtime lawyer, John Branca, and a music-industry veteran and personal friend of Mr. Jackson's named John McClain. Unlike traditional executors, Messrs. Branca and McClain are aggressively managing Mr. Jackson's affairs as a going concern. The estate's primary beneficiaries are Mr. Jackson's three young children and his 80-year-old mother, Katherine, who is now the children's guardian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Mr. Jackson's absence from the equation has eliminated the chaos and out-of-control spending that reigned during his life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using income from past music sales and advances against future ones, music-publishing royalties, a film-rights sale and various other licensing deals, the estate has paid off nearly $200 million of the $500 million debt the singer had used to fund his extravagant spending in his final years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate has collected as much as $125 million in royalties and advances from <span class="companylink">Sony Corp</span>.'s Sony Music, which has sold 31.5 million Jackson albums since his death and plans to distribute an album of previously unreleased music around November. Corporate sibling <span class="companylink">Sony</span> Pictures paid another $60 million for the rights to "This Is It," the documentary about rehearsals for Mr. Jackson's planned comeback concert series.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mijac, the publishing company that controls the copyrights to songs written by Mr. Jackson, is on track to generate $35 million in royalties. The estate is set to collect $11 million in dividends from <span class="companylink">Sony/ATV Music Publishing</span>, the joint venture with <span class="companylink">Sony Corp</span>. that controls 251 songs by the Beatles. Television and merchandise deals could generate another $10 million, while deals to create a videogame and two <span class="companylink">Cirque du Soleil</span> shows based on Mr. Jackson's music are set to provide additional revenue later this year. The Sony Music deal guarantees Mr. Jackson's estate significant additional cash advances in coming years, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Jackson's biggest financial obligation remains unresolved. A $300 million loan from <span class="companylink">Barclays PLC</span>, backed by his 50% stake in SONY/ATV, matures at the end of the year. To secure the loan in 2006, Mr. Jackson appealed for help from <span class="companylink">Sony</span>, which dispatched two executives to meet him in Dubai and negotiate terms under which it would guarantee the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, Mr. Jackson was in danger of defaulting on a $270 million loan held by hedge fund <span class="companylink">Fortress Investment Group LLC</span>. As part of the agreement under which <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> ultimately refinanced that debt, Mr. Jackson granted <span class="companylink">Sony</span> an option to buy half of his stake in the company at any time for a fixed price of $250 million. At the time that was a generous valuation, but <span class="companylink">Sony</span>/ATV's value has since soared to around $2 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Jackson estate and <span class="companylink">Sony</span> have held talks about whether the company will again guarantee a refinancing of the debt backed by Mr. Jackson's <span class="companylink">Sony</span>/ATV stake. If it won't, the estate could be forced to sell its stake in <span class="companylink">Sony</span>/ATV at a steep discount, though that would still generate enough cash to wipe out the <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> loan with hundreds of millions to spare. But <span class="companylink">Sony</span> may have an incentive to reach a deal on refinancing, because buying out Mr. Jackson's estate would require it to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for an asset it already effectively controls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this stands in stark contrast to the state of affairs when Mr. Jackson died. Despite being poised for what was heralded as a major comeback concert series, his finances were in shambles and he was unable to meet some of his most basic financial obligations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the unpaid bills at the time of his death, Mr. Jackson had not paid $341,000 to Thomas Mesereau, the lawyer who successfully defended him against charges of child molestation in 2005. That bill and many other creditors' claims, including invoices from several other law firms, have now been paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The singer was also months behind on utility bills for his longtime family home in Encino, Calif., where his mother, Katherine, now lives with his three children, along with the children of two of his brothers. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, owed nearly $9,000, was threatening to disconnect service. <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T Inc</span>. was owed $1,300.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More troubling, Mr. Jackson had fallen behind on the payments for a $5 million IndyMac loan secured by the house. The property was scheduled to enter foreclosure the day after Mr. Jackson died. A nearby condominium, four months behind on loan payments and homeowners' dues, was also threatened with foreclosure, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Jackson's representatives have now paid off those loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jackson was living in a rented mansion in Holmby Hills, a ritzy neighborhood near Bel Air, covering his sizable personal overhead with a $35 million cash advance from <span class="companylink">AEG Live</span>, the concert promoter that was planning to stage his London concerts. That loan, too, has been repaid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jackson's debts were spiraling out of control in other ways, too. A loan backed by Mijac carried a crushing 16.5% interest rate, to be paid out of royalties generated by the company. When the royalty payments fell short of the towering cost of servicing the debt, any unpaid interest was piled on to the principal. As a result, by the time of his death, the Mijac loan had reached $75 million, with $11 million due in annual interest, which was several million dollars more than the catalog was generating annually. The loan has now been refinanced with an interest rate of less than 4%. And thanks to increased album sales since Mr. Jackson's death and a new deal for public-performance royalties, the catalog is generating enough cash to pay off the refinanced loan a little more than a year from now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking to raise cash Mr. Jackson had planned, then scrapped, an auction of most of his personal effects from Neverland, his 2,600-acre ranch near Santa Barbara. In 2008, after he had defaulted on a $24.5 million loan backed by the ranch itself, the property was spared from foreclosure when <span class="companylink">Colony Capital LLC</span>, a Los Angeles real-estate investment firm, bought the note and put the property into a joint venture with Mr. Jackson. That venture is structured in such a way that Colony is responsible for the ranch's overhead, maintenance and tax costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the property is sold, Colony is entitled to recover its costs, including the $24.5 million is paid to take over the busted loan, with the majority of the additional proceeds going to Mr. Jackson's estate. People with knowledge of the situation say that because of logistical issues, Neverland is unlikely to be converted into a public attraction like Elvis Presley's Graceland, making a sale the most likely outcome, though it doesn't appear imminent.</p>
