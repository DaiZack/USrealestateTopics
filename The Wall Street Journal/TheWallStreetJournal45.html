</div><div class="author">By Phil Izzo </div><div>683 words</div><div>8 September 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect the nation's housing market to cool significantly next year, and many of them who participated in a new WSJ.com survey predict that the average home price won't rise at all in 2007 -- and may even decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those surveyed predict an average increase of 0.43% next year in the index of house prices compiled by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. The average was boosted by five economists who forecast gains of 5% or more. Twenty-five of the 48 economists who offered predictions on the index expect either no increase next year or an outright decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For this year, the economists expect an average 3.5% rise in prices, compared with gains of 13% in 2005 and 12% in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ofheo numbers are closely watched because they track the prices of the same houses over time, and thus aren't affected by the higher prices paid for better or bigger homes. But some believe the Ofheo index understates weakness in the market because it doesn't reflect concessions sometimes offered by home sellers, such as help with closing costs, which are effectively price cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market doesn't move uniformly across the country; some regions or cities have price changes above or below the national average. But the economists' predictions stand in stark contrast to the red-hot price appreciation in home prices seen in recent years. The Ofheo index hasn't posted an annual decline since it was first calculated in 1975.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing correction is just in its early stages now," said Joseph Carson of AllianceBernstein, who forecast a 5% decline for 2007. Home "prices will have to go lower to give demand a lift in the short term. Affordability is an issue across the board," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday, St. Joe Co. said it will pull out of home building in Florida amid a deep slump in housing sales and prices there. The Jacksonville, Fla., company will remain in the business of developing its vast land holdings in northwestern Florida into planned communities, but will leave the construction of homes to specialist builders. St. Joe said it expects to take a charge against earnings of about $10.7 million because of the decision. About $9 million of that charge will be recognized in the current quarter, St. Joe said. The company also expects to reduce its work force by about 10%. As of Dec. 31, St. Joe reported that it had 1,230 full-time employees. In the past decade, St. Joe has sold its industrial holdings, such as a paper mills and sugar operations, to focus on real estate and try to transform parts of Florida's panhandle into a chic place to buy a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of rapid cooling in the housing market have emerged in recent months. Although the National Association of Realtors reported a slight increase in the median price of existing homes sold in July, the group's index that tracks the number of pending home-sale deals fell 7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &amp;Poor's Corp., expects price declines in areas that are overvalued, such as Florida, California and the Northeast, or those that are especially susceptible to economic weakness, such as the Great Lakes region. "The most volatility will come in areas like Florida, where there are a large number of second homes and investment properties," he said. "Places like Michigan, which is seeing declining employment, will also see home prices declining," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Labor Department said the number of new applicants for unemployment insurance fell in the latest week, suggesting that the labor market remains stable. Initial jobless claims decreased a seasonally adjusted 9,000 to 310,000 in the week ended Sept. 2. The four-week moving average of new claims fell 3,000 last week to 315,250.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices rose only moderately in the second quarter, registering their sharpest year-to-year slowdown in more than three decades, a government report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, the agency that oversees mortgage titans Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said average home prices rose 1.17% during the quarter from the previous quarter, far short of their 3.65% gain in the year-earlier period. The slowdown in price increases was the steepest since recordkeeping began in 1975.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second-quarter rise follows price gains of 2.20% in the first quarter of 2006 and 3.08% in the fourth quarter of 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Ofheo official attributed the slowdown to higher interest rates, rising inventories of homes for sale and a decline in speculative activity, and indicated that home-price increases likely will continue to be weak. "The very high appreciation rates we've seen in recent years spurred increased construction," Ofheo chief economist Patrick Lawler said in a statement. "That, coupled with slower sales, has led to higher inventories, and these inventories will continue to constrain future appreciation rates."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the state level, Ofheo said average home prices in five states fell in the second quarter: Maine, Massachusetts, Indiana, Ohio and Michigan. The agency's report also showed that more than a fourth of the nation's 275 metropolitan areas experienced home-price declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although homes appreciated at a slower rate in the second quarter, their prices remained 10.06% higher than a year earlier. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new single-family homes fell 4.3% in July from June, the latest sign that the housing market is cooling, the government announced. An earlier report showed home-builder confidence fell in August, with the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index dropping to 32 -- its lowest point since February 1991. An NAHB index rating below 50 means that more builders expect "poor" sales in the next six months than "good" sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What to Do</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Haggle: Some builders are offering no-money-down offers, financing assistance, and promises to match housing-market prices if prices dip before closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Research: Watch for price reductions from builders on completed homes or nearly completed ones. With cancellation of home-building contracts rising, such deals may be easier to come by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Don't Be Shy: Ask for incentives or upgrades -- to draw buyers, builders are offering free upgrades on everything from landscaping to granite countertops. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Rafael Gerena-Morales </div><div>835 words</div><div>2 September 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's latest reading on the job market and a survey of factory purchasing managers offered fresh evidence that the economy has shifted into slower growth, but, so far at least, isn't tumbling into recession. The data suggested that the Federal Reserve has more latitude to hold interest rates steady again when officials meet later this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employers added 128,000 jobs outside of the farm sector in August, the Labor Department said, and payroll gains for June and July were revised up slightly. But the pace of job creation last month trailed the 146,000 average for the first half of the year, and the length of the average workweek shrank in August. The unemployment rate fell to 4.7% from 4.8% in July, remaining in the range where it has been hovering this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The job market does seem to have settled into a pace of slower but steady growth," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist for PNC Financial Services Group. The data suggest that "the Fed's decision to take no action [on Aug. 8] was a prudent decision" and "might justify doing the same" at the Sept. 20 meeting, he said. The futures market sees only a 12% chance that the Fed will raise its key rate, now at 5.25%, in September, the same odds as on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing sector continued to expand in August, but at a slower rate, the Institute for Supply Management's survey of purchasing managers indicated. The group's index of manufacturing activity dipped to 54.5 in August, from 54.7 in July. Readings have been above 50, which indicates an expanding factory sector, for 39 months. "You've got to start to ask the question, 'Are we getting near the end of the cycle?' " said Norbert Ore, who directs the survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's reports, along with data released during the week, suggest the economy is expanding at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of about 3% in the third quarter, economists said. Growth slowed to a 2.9% rate in the second quarter after a torrid 5.6% pace in the first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising exports and business investment should help soften the blow of a declining housing market, but not enough to keep broader economic growth from cooling in the second half, said Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist at Global Insight. "Business investments and exports can help fill the gap, but they won't prevent the slowdown of the economy," he said. "Businesses don't exist in a vacuum. If consumer spending slows down, which we expect it will, then business spending" will also.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The University of Michigan's new survey of consumer attitudes suggested "a significant rebound in confidence in the last half" of August as gasoline prices fell, said Richard Curtin, director of the survey. But the final August reading of 82, though above the preliminary 78.7 reading for early August interviews, was down from 84.7 in July and significantly below the year-earlier 89.1. "Despite the remarkable resilience of consumers, the data does not indicate a renewed upsurge in consumer spending but that consumers will remain cautious spenders rather than engage in sharp recessionary cutbacks," Mr. Curtin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed has said it expects the slowing economy to ease inflationary pressures. Average hourly wages of production and nonsupervisory workers inched up 0.1% to $16.79 in August, notably slower than July's 0.5% gain, the Labor Department said. For the past three months, hourly wages have been running 3.9% above year-earlier levels -- the fastest pace since June 2001. In all, production and nonsupervisory workers on private payrolls worked 0.2% fewer hours in August than in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today's report adds another data point to the emerging trend of slower job growth," said Jared Bernstein of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank in Washington. "This development should assuage the anxieties of those worried about inflationary pressures from the labor market," he said, adding, "For those worried about recession, today's report brings comfort . . . 128,000 jobs is not a great number, but it's not recessionary."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The service sector added 118,000 jobs last month, as the education and health-services industries added 60,000 jobs, and business and professional-services companies' expanded payrolls by 26,000. Retailers cut 14,000 jobs last month and manufacturers' shed 11,000 jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite a slowing housing market, the construction industry added 17,000 jobs in August. Separately, the Commerce Department, reported Friday that construction spending in July fell 1.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.2 trillion. That was the biggest drop in nearly five years. Residential construction spending fell 2.1% to $636.55 billion.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>477 words</div><div>2 September 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chief economist of the National Association of Realtors predicts that U.S. home prices will generally decline during the next few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unusually bleak assessment from David Lereah, the trade group's top economist, came as the Realtors reported that their index of pending home sales dropped 7% in July. The decline shows that home shoppers continue to take their time, hoping prices will fall amid a glut of houses on the market in many parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm hoping for prices to drop," Mr. Lereah said in an interview. The Realtors normally stress the tendency of home prices to rise over the long term. But Mr. Lereah said lower prices are needed in some parts of the U.S. to lure buyers back into the market. During the past year, sales have plunged in California, southern Florida and the Washington, D.C., area, all places where prices more than doubled in the first half of this decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales have stalled partly because "the sellers are not bringing prices down fast enough," Mr. Lereah said. "They've been very stubborn." A drop of 5% to 10% in California and southern Florida "probably would be enough to bring sales back," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For July, the Realtors reported that the national median home price was up 0.9% from a year earlier. But Mr. Lereah said he expects the national median to decline modestly in the next few months. That would mark the first decline since 1993. "The quicker we can get negative prices, the quicker we can get sales coming back," Mr. Lereah said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Lawler, a housing economist in Vienna, Va., said the national median home price in this year's fourth quarter is likely to be down 3% to 4% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, median prices in some areas -- including San Diego, Boston, the Virginia suburbs of Washington and parts of Florida -- already have fallen from year-earlier levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pending-sales index, which equates the average pending-sales rate of 2001 to 100, registered 105.6 in July. The latest reading was down 7% from June and 16% from July 2005. The index, based on signed contracts for home sales that haven't yet been completed, has fallen nearly 18% since hitting a peak of 128.2 in August 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, the July index was down 20% from a year earlier in the West and Midwest, 16% in the Northeast and 11% in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that its seasonally adjusted index of applications for home-purchase mortgages declined 1.6% in the week ended Aug. 25. That index -- a measure of demand for homes -- is down about 20% from a year ago. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking back at past U.S. housing booms, the first sign of the end is when a goodly share of buyers stop making offers and eventually stop looking, seeming to just disappear. In the spring of 1987, during another housing-market boom that was starting to lose speed, Nora Moran, president of the Greater Boston real estate board, said "someone blew a whistle that only dogs and buyers heard."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across America today, it is as if the whistle has again been blown. New home sales in the U.S. in July are 22% below July 2005. The decrease is 43% for the Northeast over that same period, and the inventory of unsold new homes is up 22%. Existing home sales are down to 6.33 million in July from over seven million at the end of 2005. Older boomers are cashing out of valuable suburban homes and heading for condos in the city, or out of high priced regions altogether.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is this happening so suddenly? It can't be interest rates alone. The 30-year mortgage rate is up less than one percentage point since this time last year, and is no higher than it was a few years ago when this boom was roaring along.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market spoiler was in place some years ago. In 2004, it was already clear that something was amiss in the market. At that time, we felt that the spectacular price increases could not be justified. The psychology of that time could not continue indefinitely, and indeed it has not.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the summer of 2004, the annual rate of increase for home prices in major U.S. cities reached its peak. According to the Standard &amp; Poor's/Case-Shiller Composite Home Price Index, based on 10 major U.S. metro areas, housing inflation reached 20.4% in the 12 months ending in July 2004. Now, the latest numbers announced Tuesday show only an 8.2% increase in the 12 months ending June 2006, and most of that increase was in 2005. Six of the 10 cities actually fell between May and June. By simple extrapolation, if U.S. housing price changes continue to decline as they have, inflation will turn into deflation, and 12-month price changes might be squarely in negative territory by some time in 2007.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk is part of what changes the mood and actions of buyers, and the air is now full of talk of a bust. The front pages of The Wall Street Journal and other newspapers, and the covers of the New Yorker, the Economist and virtually every news magazine in America have heralded the bursting of the "housing bubble."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of what has focused the spotlight on the housing market has been the sheer size of the boom. Ten years ago, household holdings of real estate were valued at just under $8 trillion, about 40% as large as household financial wealth. At the end of 2005, real-estate holdings were $21.6 trillion, 56% as large as financial wealth. Just in the last five years, the total market value of residential real estate alone has increased by nearly $10 trillion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New construction, initiated in response to high home prices, has reached unprecedented levels, and new houses are still hitting the market just as demand is dropping. Between 2000 and 2005, housing starts were over two million per year, existing home sales were over six million per year and home improvement spending hit $162 billion in 2005. All of this generated income for millions of brokers, builders, bankers, appliance dealers and construction workers, and kept the U.S. economy growing at a strong clip. But the housing construction boom can't go on forever.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This incredible boom has been fueled in part by favorable demographics, low interest rates, a very liquid mortgage market with low down payments and borrower-friendly underwriting (option arms, interest-only, stated-income, etc.), a baby boomer generation with a special taste for housing, a substantial volume of foreign demand, and the poor overall performance of the stock market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But beyond all these factors there is the simple psychology of expectations that is part of any speculative boom. These expectations can turn suddenly when alert home buyers get the sense that something might be amiss. Among respondents to our questionnaire survey of home buyers in April and May of this year, the median expected 12-month home price increase in Los Angeles was only 5%, compared to 10% in early 2005. In Boston, the median expectation was down to 2% from 5% last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long-term expectations for home price appreciation have fallen much less. People haven't changed their basic views on housing as a great long-term investment. Not yet, at least. That won't happen unless we get a protracted housing price decline.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While our surveys indicate that relatively few expect prices to actually fall, buyers do not want to pay prices that are significantly higher than a year ago. Buyers are waiting and low-balling. Sellers want to get a price increase of the kind they've observed in the recent past. The result is that fewer agreements are reached, and sales fall. If the housing market were like the bond market and all houses for sale were auctioned every day, prices would indeed fall precipitously. But they are not. The aggregate indexes based on repeat sales have decelerated markedly but are not yet falling.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. now has a futures market based on home prices. The market that opened in May at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is now showing backwardation in all 10 metropolitan areas trading. The backwardation can be expressed as implying a rate of decline of 5% a year for the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Composite Index by May 2007. Since the margin requirement is only about 2.5%, an investor who is sure that prices cannot actually fall by next May has, on that assumption, a sure return of at least 200% from buying a futures contract, and even more if prices rise at all. But not enough people see this as money on the table. In reality, people no longer see it as a sure thing that prices won't start falling across the metro areas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As always, the future is uncertain. Many of the underpinnings of the boom are still strong, and the soft-landing scenario so widely promoted by economists and industry leaders is a possibility if the U.S. can avoid a generalized inflation, if long rates don't rise a lot, and if the rest of the economy stays strong. But that possibility is not enough to give great comfort to all those who worry today about the U.S. housing market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, there is significant risk of a very bad period, with slow sales, slim commissions, falling prices, rising default and foreclosures, serious trouble in financial markets, and a possible recession sooner than most of us expected. Deterioration in that intangible housing market psychology is the most uncertain factor in the outlook today. Listen hard and watch out.  </p>

In the spring of 1987, during another housing-market boom that was starting to lose speed, Nora Moran, president of the Greater Boston real estate board, said "someone blew a whistle that only dogs and buyers heard."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the country today, it is as if the whistle has again been blown. New home sales in July are 22% below July 2005. The decrease is 43% for the Northeast over that same period, and the inventory of unsold new homes is up 22%. Existing home sales are down to 6.33 million in July from over seven million at the end of 2005. Older boomers are cashing out of valuable suburban homes and heading for condos in the city, or out of high priced regions altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is this happening so suddenly? It can't be interest rates alone. The 30-year mortgage rate is up less than one percentage point since this time last year, and is no higher than it was a few years ago when this boom was roaring along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market spoiler was in place some years ago: When we wrote on this page two years ago ("Mi Casa Es Su Housing Bubble," Aug. 24, 2004), it was already clear that something was amiss in the market. At that time, we felt that the spectacular price increases could not be justified. The psychology of that time could not continue indefinitely, and indeed it has not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the summer of 2004, the annual rate of increase for home prices in major U.S. cities reached its peak. According to the Standard &amp;Poor's/Case-Shiller Composite Home Price Index, based on 10 major metro areas, housing inflation reached 20.4% in the 12 months ending in July 2004. Now, the latest numbers announced yesterday show only an 8.2% increase in the 12 months ending June 2006, and most of that increase was in 2005. Six of the 10 cities actually fell between May and June. By simple extrapolation, if housing price changes continue to decline as they have, inflation will turn into deflation, and 12-month price changes might be squarely in negative territory by some time in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk is part of what changes the mood and actions of buyers, and the air is now full of talk of a bust. The front pages of The Wall Street Journal and other newspapers, and the covers of the New Yorker, the Economist and virtually every news magazine in the country have heralded the bursting of the "housing bubble."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of what has focused the spotlight on the housing market has been the sheer size of the boom. Ten years ago, household holdings of real estate were valued at just under $8 trillion, about 40% as large as household financial wealth. At the end of 2005, real-estate holdings were $21.6 trillion, 56% as large as financial wealth. Just in the last five years, the total market value of residential real estate alone has increased by nearly $10 trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New construction, initiated in response to high home prices, has reached unprecedented levels, and new houses are still hitting the market just as demand is dropping. Between 2000 and 2005, housing starts were over two million per year, existing home sales were over six million per year and home improvement spending hit $162 billion in 2005. All of this generated income for millions of brokers, builders, bankers, appliance dealers and construction workers, and kept the economy growing at a strong clip. But the housing construction boom can't go on forever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This incredible boom has been fueled in part by favorable demographics, low interest rates, a very liquid mortgage market with low down payments and borrower-friendly underwriting (option arms, interest-only, stated-income, etc.), a baby boomer generation with a special taste for housing, a substantial volume of foreign demand, and the poor overall performance of the stock market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But beyond all these factors there is the simple psychology of expectations that is part of any speculative boom. These expectations can turn suddenly when alert home buyers get the sense that something might be amiss. Among respondents to our questionnaire survey of home buyers in April and May of this year, the median expected 12-month home price increase in Los Angeles was only 5%, compared to 10% in early 2005. In Boston, the median expectation was down to 2% from 5% last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long-term expectations for home price appreciation have fallen much less. People haven't changed their basic views on housing as a great long-term investment. Not yet, at least. That won't happen unless we get a protracted housing price decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While our surveys indicate that relatively few expect prices to actually fall, buyers do not want to pay prices that are significantly higher than a year ago. Buyers are waiting and low-balling. Sellers want to get a price increase of the kind they've observed in the recent past. The result is that fewer agreements are reached, and sales fall. If the housing market were like the bond market and all houses for sale were auctioned every day, prices would indeed fall precipitously. But they are not. The aggregate indexes based on repeat sales have decelerated markedly but are not yet falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We now have a futures market based on home prices. The market that opened in May at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is now showing backwardation in all 10 metropolitan areas trading. The backwardation can be expressed as implying a rate of decline of 5% a year for the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Composite Index by May 2007. Since the margin requirement is only about 2.5%, an investor who is sure that prices cannot actually fall by next May has, on that assumption, a sure return of at least 200% from buying a futures contract, and even more if prices rise at all. But not enough people see this as money on the table. In reality, people no longer see it as a sure thing that prices won't start falling across the metro areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As always, the future is uncertain. Many of the underpinnings of the boom are still strong, and the soft-landing scenario so widely promoted by economists and industry leaders is a possibility if we can avoid a generalized inflation, if long rates don't rise a lot, and if the rest of the economy stays strong. But that possibility is not enough to give great comfort to all those who worry today about the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, there is significant risk of a very bad period, with slow sales, slim commissions, falling prices, rising default and foreclosures, serious trouble in financial markets, and a possible recession sooner than most of us expected. Deterioration in that intangible housing market psychology is the most uncertain factor in the outlook today. Listen hard and watch out.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Christopher Conkey </div><div>541 words</div><div>25 August 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes tumbled last month, but a firm reading on orders for big-ticket factory goods suggests the economy will continue to grow moderately despite head winds from a slumping housing market and high energy prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said sales of new homes in July fell 4.3% from June to a rate of 1.07 million units, a pace that is 21.6% slower than a year ago. The inventory of unsold homes on the market rose to a supply of 6.5 months, up from 4.2 months a year earlier, while the median price fell to $230,000 in July and is essentially flat compared with a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those numbers suggest the downturn in the housing market is deepening and will continue to weigh on the economy. But a separate report from the Commerce Department on the manufacturing sector suggests businesses and consumers are still spending enough to produce modest economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for durable goods excluding transportation in July rose 0.5% from June following even bigger gains the previous two months. In a sign that business spending is picking up after a mild second quarter, orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased 1.5% last month after posting similar increases the two previous months. Overall, orders for durable goods fell 2.4% last month due to a drop in the volatile transportation sector, which includes car and aircraft manufacturers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists closely monitor orders for durable goods -- items such as lawn mowers, desktop computers and cars that are intended to last three years or longer -- to get a sense of what business and consumer spending will be like a couple months down the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the weakening housing market and high gasoline prices making consumers more cautious, many economists expect businesses that have enjoyed big profits recently to pick up some of the slack. Roger Kubarych, senior economic adviser for HVB America in New York, said that yesterday's report confirms that the economy is undergoing a "profound shift away from a disproportionate emphasis on housing and personal consumption expenditures toward greater business investment and exports."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're trying to pass the baton here," said Josh Feinman, chief economist at Deutsche Asset Management. He noted that both shipments and new orders for durable goods in June were revised higher, making it likely that the economy grew at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of closer to 3% in the second quarter, rather than the initially reported 2.5% growth rate. For the rest of the year, Mr. Feinman estimates the economy will grow at a slightly slower pace than the second quarter. The Commerce Department will release its revised figure on second-quarter growth on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Labor Department said the number of people filing initial unemployment claims last week was nearly unchanged from a week earlier, suggesting that the labor market will continue to produce mild job creation, but low unemployment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Mortgage rates in the U.S. fell across the board in the past week as home sales slid to two-year lows, housing-finance agency <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average for 30-year fixed mortgage rates for the week ended Aug. 24 was 6.48%, down from 6.52% a week earlier, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said in its weekly primary mortgage market survey. A year ago, the rate averaged 5.77%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages this week was 6.18%, down from 6.20% a week earlier but up from the year-earlier 5.35%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages were at 6.14%, down from 6.18% a week ago but up from 5.30% a year earlier. One-year Treasury-indexed ARMs were 5.60%, down from 5.65% but up from the year-earlier 4.56%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> Vice President Frank Nothaft said that the theory that the Fed may leave interest rates on hold at 5.25% for at least the near future had relieved upward pressure on mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Although both existing and new home sales for July fell below market expectations, confirming the slowdown in the housing market, we still expect 2006 to be the third-highest year on record for total sales," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Demand for U.S. durable goods pulled back more than expected in July after a strong gain the month before, as orders fell for cars, civilian aircraft and electrical equipment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. new-home sales for July fell for a second consecutive month, as mounting inventories allowed would-be buyers to wait for better deals.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Durable-goods orders decreased by 2.4% from June to a seasonally adjusted $211.99 billion, the U.S. Commerce Department said. June's rise in orders was revised to 3.5% from the original estimate of a 2.9% increase.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key barometer of business spending -- orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- increased by 1.5%, after rising by 1.4% in June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The July fall in overall orders was greater than expected. The median estimate of 23 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires was for a decline of 1%. July's drop was the second in six months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report earlier this month showed the manufacturing sector continued to expand in July. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing activity rose to 54.7 from 53.8 in June. A reading above 50 suggests the sector is growing. Production increased last month after new orders rose in June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's durable-goods data showed transportation orders fell 9.6% in July after increasing 7.1% in June. Orders for commercial planes dropped 10%, while military-aircraft orders increased 9%. Orders for motor vehicles and parts fell 7%, the largest drop in that category since 8.5% in July 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders excluding transportation goods increased 0.5%, after a 2.2% climb in June. Demand advanced last month by 1.9% for machinery, 4.6% for computers and electronics and 1.2% for primary metals. Orders dropped 6.2% for fabricated metals and 0.7% for electrical equipment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, Commerce said sales of single-family homes in July fell 4.3% from June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.072 million. June sales fell 0.9% to 1.12 million, revised from a previously estimated 3% decline to 1.131 million. Economists had been looking for July sales to fall 2.7% to a 1.1 million annual rate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July's sales were down 21.6% from a year earlier. Data this year have repeatedly showed a softening housing sector. On Wednesday, the National Association of Realtors reported existing-home sales fell last month to the lowest point since January 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financing costs are rising. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. crept up to 6.76% in July from June's 6.68% and the year-earlier 5.7%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of a home in July rose to $293,500 from a revised $289,300 in June and $289,300 in July 2005, according to Commerce. The median price fell, however, to $230,000 in July from a revised $233,800 in June and $229,200 in July 2005. There were an estimated 568,000 homes for sale at the end of July, a record level.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the number of new applicants for state unemployment insurance fell last week, the second consecutive decrease, suggesting that U.S. labor markets remain relatively healthy.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. fell in July to the lowest level in 2 1/2 years, and the inventory of unsold homes climbed to a new high, signs that the U.S. housing market is unraveling at an even faster pace than had been expected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures released by the National Association of Realtors yesterday show sales of existing homes fell to a seasonally adjusted rate of 6.33 million units in July, down 4.1% from June and 11.2% from July 2005. The decline was sharper than the 6.55 million-unit pace that economists had been expecting.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR chief economist David Lereah said higher interest rates damped sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many potential home buyers have been on the sidelines, some 'kicking the tires,' but mostly waiting for sellers to compromise on prices and terms," Mr. Lereah said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of unsold homes rose 3.2% to a record 3.856 million, a 7.3-months supply at the July sales rate, the highest since April 1993. The past year has seen the sharpest increase in inventories on record, Mr. Lereah said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average 30-year mortgage rate was 6.76% in July, up from 6.68% in June, according to Freddie Mac.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Against that backdrop, the U.S. Federal Reserve earlier this month decided to halt a rate-raising campaign that had pushed interest rates steadily higher over the past two-plus years to fend off inflation. The Fed's goal is to raise rates sufficiently to thwart inflation but not enough to hurt the economy. One of the things that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues are watching closely is the housing slowdown.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lereah said he still expects a "soft landing" for the once-high-flying housing sector. But he urged the Fed to leave interest rates alone and refrain from bumping them up again.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Christopher Conkey </div><div>536 words</div><div>24 August 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the downturn in the housing market deepens, the South is weathering the situation better than other regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While sales of existing homes clocked double-digit declines in the West, Midwest and Northeast in July compared with a year earlier, sales in the South were down a more modest 7% on the year and 1.2% from June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price of previously owned homes in the South last month actually increased from June and was 3.2% higher than a year earlier. The other three regions, however, experienced median-price declines over the past year, according to the National Association of Realtors. The median is the amount where half of homes sell for more and half sell for less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the median sales price for existing homes was $230,000 last month, up 0.9% from last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales last month fell 4.1% from June to an annual pace of 6.33 million units, a rate 11.2% lower than a year earlier. By region, in contrast to the South, the pace of sales compared with year-earlier results fell 18% in the West, 12.5% in the Northeast and 10.1% in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of unsold homes nationwide rose 3.2% to a record 3.85 million, a 7.3-month supply at the July sales rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from better price appreciation and higher rates of existing-home sales, the South has fared better than the other three regions in the current downturn when it comes to sales of new homes, building permits and new residential construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the explanation, economists say, is that prices in many housing markets in the South, with the exception of Florida, never took off as others did in the West and Northeast, and therefore they don't have as far to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor is population growth. Census Bureau figures show the population in the South increased nearly 7% between 2000 and 2005, while the populations of the Midwest and Northeast rose by about 2% in the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Charlotte, N.C., both factors are combining with solid economic growth to boost the area's housing market. "We have not seen price appreciation like other cities," said Phillip Neuhart, an economic analyst with Wachovia Corp. in Charlotte. "People can come here and buy a more affordable home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, the NAR's chief economist, said several big markets in Texas are "all relatively healthy" and Richmond, Va., is "pretty hot," but he expects year-over-year prices in the South to join other regions in negative territory in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Mortgage Bankers Association said its index of mortgage applications was essentially flat last week and is 25% lower than a year earlier. Applications for refinancings, however, rose 1.3% last week as homeowners moved to take advantage of a downshift in interest rates.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty and Michael Corkery </div><div>2467 words</div><div>23 August 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HERNDON, Va. -- For years, real-estate brokers and home builders promised that the soaring property market eventually would glide to a soft landing. These optimists predicted that home prices, which had more than doubled in parts of the country between 2000 and 2005, would continue to rise, but at a more normal pace of 5% or 6% a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't working out that way. The rapid deterioration of the market over the past 12 months has caught many homeowners and builders off guard. Some are being forced to cut prices far below what their homes could have fetched a year ago. It's too early to say how hard the landing will be, but at a minimum it will be bumpy for many people who need to sell homes. And the economy as a whole, buoyed in recent years by the housing frenzy, could suffer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pain that homeowners and home builders are now feeling follows a raging national house party. As Americans soured on the stock market after the tech bubble burst in 2000, they poured money into real estate, spurred on by the lowest interest rates in four decades and looser lending standards. Surging demand created home shortages in California, Florida and the Northeast. Over the five years ending Dec. 31, average U.S. home prices jumped by 58%, according to a federal housing index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But mortgage rates began rising and surging inventories of homes for sale finally caught up with demand. Though economists had been predicting a slowdown in housing for years, many homeowners and builders were surprised by how fast the market changed. "It's just like somebody flipped a switch," says Lynn Gardner, a real-estate auctioneer who works in Northern Virginia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It would be difficult to characterize the position of home builders as other than in a hard landing," says Robert Toll, chief executive of luxury home builder Toll Brothers Inc., which reported yesterday that net income fell 19% in the third quarter ended July 31. (See related article on page A2.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his 40 years as a home builder, Mr. Toll says, he has never seen a slump unfold like the current one. "I've never seen a downturn in housing without a downturn in employment or . . . some macroeconomic nasty condition that took housing down along with other elements of the economy," he says. "This time, you've got low unemployment, you've got job creation, you've got a stable stock market and relatively low interest rates."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joan Guth is one homeowner who was taken by surprise. Last September, she put her stately five-bedroom home in Herndon, Va., on the market for about $1.1 million. She was confident she would get something near that price, and planned to use the proceeds to buy a retirement home in Florida. But her home in the Washington suburbs attracted few serious lookers, and in March, she cut her asking price to $899,900. Still there were no takers. Finally, on the advice of her broker, she called in an auction firm, beginning a process that would eventually reveal to her just how weak the Northern Virginia market had become.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In much of the country, property markets began cooling rapidly in the second half of last year. Home builders were still turning out houses at a rapid clip, and the surge of new and previously occupied homes on the market convinced buyers there was no need to hurry. Over the past year, the number of previously occupied homes listed for sale nationwide has risen nearly 40%. In some metropolitan areas, including Orlando and Phoenix, the supply has quadrupled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors who during the boom had been snapping up properties from the outskirts of Phoenix to the slums of Baltimore began dumping them on the market, hoping to get out with a profit before it was too late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resulting slump, thus far, is being felt mainly on the East and West coasts and in Florida, where home prices had soared beyond the average working family's ability to pay. In California's San Diego County, the median home-sale price was $487,000 in July, down 1.8% from a year earlier, according to DataQuick Information Systems, a research firm in San Diego. Prices in the Northern Virginia counties of Fairfax and Arlington and in nearby towns, near Washington, averaged $537,731 in July, down 3.9% from a year earlier, according to the Northern Virginia Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some other parts of the country, notably Texas and the Seattle area, local housing markets remain robust. Texas' low housing costs are attracting new residents and investors, while Seattle's strong job market and shortage of homes have kept prices rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the median sale price of previously occupied homes in June was 0.9% higher than it was a year earlier, the smallest year-to-year increase since May 1995, according to the National Association of Realtors, a trade group. Over the next few months, the median price may decline from year-earlier periods, a spokesman for the association says, something that hasn't happened since February 1993.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market may be weaker than the Realtors' widely followed monthly reports suggest. The group's data don't reflect the latest transactions. Its report on July home sales, for instance, due today, will mainly reflect sales that were agreed upon in May or June and closed in July. Moreover, when the market turns down, many home sellers initially let their homes sit instead of cutting prices enough to entice buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allen Sinai, chief economist at Decision Economics Inc., a New York research firm, contends that housing is poised for something "harder than a soft landing but softer than a hard landing." The weaker market will hurt the economy by eliminating jobs in construction and other housing-related fields and by reducing the ability of consumers to finance spending by borrowing against their home equity. Mr. Sinai predicts these factors could shave as much as a percentage point off economic growth over the next year or so. Taking that into account, he expects the economy to grow at a relatively sluggish annual rate of 2.5% to 2.75% in 2007, compared with 2.5% in this year's second quarter and 5.6% in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech yesterday, Michael Moskow, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, noted: "While we factor a housing slowdown into our outlook, there is some evidence -- such as higher rates of cancellation in home-building contracts -- that the slowdown could be more extensive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With fewer consumers applying for home loans, some big mortgage lenders are already retrenching. Countrywide Financial Corp. last month announced plans to reduce costs by $500 million. Earlier this year, Washington Mutual Inc. eliminated 2,500 jobs at loan-processing centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders, who were optimistic about prospects until a few months ago, are cutting back too. KB Home, a big home builder based in Los Angeles, has eliminated 7% of its work force, or 440 jobs. In July, U.S. home builders started construction at an annual rate of 1.45 million single-family homes, down 20% from the January peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last August, when Horsham, Pa.-based Toll Brothers reported that its quarterly profit had doubled, Mr. Toll boasted: "We've got the supply, and the market has got the demand. So it's a match made in heaven." Since then, Toll has cuts its guidance four times on the number of homes it expects to close on, and its share price has fallen by more than 45%. Yesterday, the company said orders for new homes in the third quarter were down 48% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Toll blames a "drop in confidence" among prospective home buyers, who he says are worried about "the direction of America" and the situation in Iraq. The retreat of speculators who were buying and "flipping" homes also hurt the market, he says. Such speculative buyers, who Mr. Toll estimates accounted for about 10% of demand one year ago, are now sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, Mr. Toll contends that new household formation, immigration, job creation and rising affluence are currently producing a pent-up demand for housing. Once Americans believe that home prices have bottomed, he argues, they will rush back into the market, although he is unwilling to predict when that will happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At D.R. Horton Inc., the nation's largest home builder by units built per year, executives said late last year they were confident that quarterly earnings would continue to increase even during a housing-market slump. In July, Horton reported a 21% decline in net income for the third quarter ended June 30, the first quarter in 28 years in which it didn't report year-over-year profit growth. Horton's chief executive, Donald Tomnitz, said the surge in home prices had priced many people out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every time we've gone into a downturn in the home-building industry, they've always been longer and deeper than we've all imagined," Mr. Tomnitz told analysts in a July 20 conference call. "So we're preparing for the worst, and we think this one will be longer and deeper than just the last six months."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some homeowners who bought as the market was peaking last year, the downturn is already creating a financial pinch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April 2005, Jennifer Bloom paid about $229,000 for a condominium in Yarmouth Port on Massachusetts's Cape Cod, where her son planned to live. After his plans changed, Ms. Bloom, a software specialist for a computer company, decided early this year to sell the condo. She initially listed it at $229,000, and then gradually shaved the price to $199,000 as the market weakened. Earlier this month, she gave up on finding a buyer at a price she could bear to accept. Instead, she is renting out the condo for $1,000 a month, which she says is more than $200 below her monthly costs for mortgage payments, insurance, taxes and other items. She says she intends to hold off on selling it until the market improves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slump has been particularly harsh in Northern Virginia, where in recent years, large home builders have turned open fields and wooded lots into new subdivisions. Inventories of unsold homes here have risen 147% over the past year, compared to a 40% increase nationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would-be sellers such as Tahir Javed, a 36-year-old management consultant, are growing frustrated. One year ago, Mr. Javed decided to move up from his town house in Ashburn, Va. He signed a contract to buy for $983,000 a four-bedroom brick colonial that a developer planned to build in nearby Leesburg. He put down a $60,000 deposit and planned to move into the new house in October 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, Mr. Javed put his town house on the market for $499,900, which he says is far above the $212,000 he paid in 1999, but in line with asking prices for similar homes in the neighborhood. He hasn't been able to find a buyer, and the balance he owes on his new house -- about $920,000 -- is due in about six weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Javed says he asked the builder for a price break, but the answer was no. He's considering cutting the asking price for his town house to slightly under $470,000, and if that doesn't work, he may try to find a renter. He had planned to use the money from selling the town house as a 20% down payment on what he owes on his new home, and to borrow the other 80%. Now he may need a bigger loan, which could carry a higher interest rate, he says. "That is the painful part," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Guth, whose home in Herndon, Va., had failed to attract a buyer after months on the market, eventually turned to Tranzon Fox, an auction firm based in Burke, Va. Ms. Guth had based her initial $1.1 million asking price on a 2005 appraisal of her home, which now appeared far off the mark. She and her family decided they would accept the highest bid of at least $675,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kristin Eddy, a 35-year-old pediatric occupational therapist living in a town home in Reston, Va., had noticed Ms. Guth's dark-green turreted home with its wraparound verandas while riding her bike along a nearby trail. "I've had my eye on that house for a long time -- as a dream," Ms. Eddy says. When it first went on the market, it was far beyond her price range. Then she noticed the sign announcing the auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the morning of Aug. 5, the auctioneer, Stephen Karbelk, set up loudspeakers on Ms. Guth's side lawn. Ms. Guth handed bottles of chilled water to the several dozen bidders and curious neighbors who showed up. "I have a whole stomach full of butterflies," Ms. Guth said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Eddy figured her chances of winning were near zero. When the auction began, it became clear that there were only two serious bidders. Although Mr. Karbelk tried to stir excitement, the bidding petered out within minutes. Ms. Eddy was the high bidder, at $475,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking stricken, Ms. Guth and one of her sons huddled with their broker for a few minutes. Then they told the auctioneer they wouldn't accept the bid, which fell below the stipulated minimum that hadn't been revealed to bidders. The auction was over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Guth said she would move and leave the house empty until she could sell it at a reasonable price. Late that afternoon, Ms. Eddy raised her offer to $525,000. The Guths wavered for two days before agreeing to accept about $530,000. Ms. Eddy is getting a home with five bedrooms, four full bathrooms, a half-acre lot and a three-car garage for about what some people had been paying until recently for town houses in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Guth has revised her retirement plan. The disappointing auction result made it difficult for her to afford the kind of home she wanted in Florida. She has decided to buy a home in South Hill, a rural area of south-central Virginia where home prices are cheaper than they are in either Florida or the Washington suburbs. She thinks she can find a home there for $175,000 or less. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Today's Market Forecast]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Toll for Housing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brace yourself for more bad housing news. First up is today's earnings report from Toll Brothers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upscale home builder based in suburban Philadelphia already warned that results would come in below estimates two weeks ago, when it reported orders for the quarter ended July 31 were down 47% from a year ago. Toll Brothers also said it would write down some of the options it had bought to buy land, and that more buyers were forgoing their down payments and canceling orders. Robert Toll, the company's CEO, said the overall economy was basically healthy and not the source of the housing market's woes. Instead, he pinned the swoon on a glut of unsold homes, created after speculative buyers abandoned the market, and a related drop in confidence among traditional home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's been only two weeks since the warning, and the news on the housing market has gotten worse. Last week the National Association of Home Builders reported confidence among home builders hit a 15-year low. The University of Michigan's preliminary reading on August consumer sentiment showed households themselves view this as the worst time to go out and buy a home since 1990, a recessionary period that led to nasty housing declines in places like Boston and California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home inventories and shaky sales have put pressure on housing prices. Tomorrow's report on existing-home sales from the National Association of Realtors and Thursday's report on new-home sales from the Commerce Department may show that in July home prices had their first decline from year-ago-levels since 1995. In June they were up 0.9% and 2.3%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If prices are falling, that could increase the ranks of housing market fence-sitters, people who are holding off on buying with hopes of getting better deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lingering concern on Wall Street is that this snowballs. Price decline could challenge the beliefs of homeowners who see their houses as a store for retirement savings and force them to cut back spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The message of the housing boom was that housing prices are always going to go up so you don't have to rely on conventional ways of saving," says Lehman Brothers economist Ethan Harris. "Now that view has to be changing."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Growth in Consumer Prices Slows --- Core Measure Rises 0.2%, As Housing Data Look Soft; CPI Report to Gain Precision</span>
</div><div class="author">By Christopher Conkey </div><div>990 words</div><div>17 August 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underlying inflation eased in July for the first time in several months, a reprieve for the economy that suggests the Federal Reserve's campaign of interest-rate increases may be at an end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said its "core" measure of consumer prices, which excludes food and energy, increased by 0.2% last month from June, breaking a string of four consecutive 0.3% increases that had raised fears of a sustained inflationary spiral. Core prices were 2.7% higher in July than a year ago on an unadjusted basis, up from 2.6% in June. Overall, consumer prices rose 0.4% last month, in line with this year's trend, and were 4.1% above year-ago levels, down from 4.3% in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While prices are rising, and could pick up again in the months ahead, the slower pace of underlying inflation in July offers support for the Fed's decision earlier this month to leave interest rates unchanged. More importantly, with the economy appearing to downshift to moderate growth, the tamer July reading on price changes is an early hint that future rate increases may not be necessary to curb inflation. "There's a sense the Fed may be truly done," said Peter Kretzmer, senior economist at Bank of America Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets rallied on the news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 96.86 points, or 0.9%, to 11327.12, hitting a three-month high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and a majority of Fed policy makers chose to leave the federal-funds rate unchanged at 5.25% this month after 17 consecutive quarter-point increases, viewing this year's inflationary swell as more of a temporary byproduct of higher energy prices than a fundamental overheating of the economy. By holding rates steady, the Fed calculated that the impact of its two-year campaign of rate increases, in tandem with slower economic growth and stabilizing energy prices, would likely be enough to curb inflation in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other consideration, of course, was that raising rates further would run the risk of aggravating the housing-market slowdown and pushing the economy into recession. News on that front yesterday from the Commerce Department suggested the real-estate market is in for more weakening, another validation of the Fed's decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 2.5% in July to an annual rate of nearly 1.8 million units following a 5.7% plunge in June. The pace of new-home construction is off nearly 21% from its peak in January and is 13.3% lower than a year ago. Similarly, permits for new construction, an indication of building activity a couple months down the road, were down 6.5% from June to an annual rate of 1.75 million, and are running almost 21% lower compared with last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is more evidence the market is still on a downward path," said David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. "There are still some things that need to be corrected."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among those, he said, is the rising rate of cancellations, which by his latest estimate has increased to 7.4% of new sales, up from 3.5% a year ago. "Builders are giving stuff away all over the place," Mr. Seiders said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One byproduct of the weakening housing market is a rise in the number of potential buyers who decide to rent instead, pushing up the rental market. By the Labor Department's estimate, rents rose 0.4% last month, the biggest factor boosting the consumer-price index. Elevated energy prices continued to push inflation up, too. Gasoline prices rose again last month, sending transportation prices up 1.6% from June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apparel prices, on the other hand, fell 1.2% in July as retailers discounted spring and summer lines even more than usual to make way for fall fashions. In announcing a July decrease in comparable-store sales from a year earlier, for example, Gap Inc. this month emphasized the pressure it faced to move inventory by lowering prices. "Gap and Old Navy decided to take aggressive markdowns in July to clear product and enable a clean presentation of fall assortments," said Sabrina Simmons, senior vice president of treasury and investor relations for the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Fed yesterday also reported that industrial production rose 0.4% in July -- following a 0.8% surge in June -- on the strength of an uptick in utility output due to heightened electricity demand. The rate of capacity utilization, watched closely for signs the economy is straining its limits, was essentially unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite signs of moderating economic growth and softer inflation in July, it is far from certain the Fed is done raising interest rates. Policy makers will have another month's data before them when they meet on Sept. 20, including figures on employment and inflation for August. In a speech yesterday, Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and a nonvoting member of the Fed's monetary-policy committee, underscored the uncertainty: "If anybody tells you with absolute conviction that the Fed is done raising interest rates or with equal conviction that they have only paused and will raise rates more starting in September or October, remind yourself that at best . . . they are only guessing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department also said it will begin publishing the CPI out to three decimal places beginning in January in order to eliminate any confusion stemming from rounding differences. By the new system, core inflation this month would have been reported as a 0.194% rise in July.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. Treasury prices were holding onto solid gains midafternoon yesterday, after tame inflation and weaker housing data sent yields to their lowest levels since April.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year note was was up 16/32 at 100 2/32 for a yield of 4.87%. The 30-year note was up 23/32 at 92 12/32, yielding 5%, while the two-year note was up 4/32 at 100 7/32 to yield 4.88%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department reported the U.S. consumer-price index increased 0.4% in July, as economists expected. The core CPI reading, excluding food and energy, was up 0.2%, below the 0.3% forecast. Meanwhile, housing starts fell 2.5% to the slowest pace since November 2004. Building permits fell.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. economic reports released yesterday -- including tame core inflation, a decline in housing starts and weaker-than-expected industrial output -- conform to the script laid out by Federal Reserve policy makers that slower economic growth will ease price pressures.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the reports suggest policy makers can hold rates steady when they meet next month and perhaps even beyond.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consumer-price index increased 0.4% in July, matching expectations and doubling the prior month's gain on the back of a 2.9% rise in energy prices, the U.S. Labor Department said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the core consumer-price index, which excludes food and energy items, grew 0.2% and broke a string of four consecutive 0.3% monthly gains. Economists had expected another 0.3% reading in July. Core consumer prices grew 2.7% on a year-to-year basis, the highest since December 2001. The three-month annualized core rate moderated to 3.2% from 3.6%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Although these readings remain elevated, the Fed can take some comfort from the fact that they have at least stopped rising for now," said Ryan Wang, economist at HSBC. Last week, the Fed paused its tightening cycle at 5.25% after 17 consecutive quarter-point increases, betting that its forecast of slower economic growth will limit price pressures in coming months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coming on the heels of a drop in core producer prices Tuesday, the consumer-price report "offers a measure of vindication to the Federal Open Market Committee's decision," said Kenneth Beauchemin, economist at Global Insight. "Odds of a further rate hike in September are falling."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed officials "know the economy is losing momentum" and that its recent rate increases will act as a restraining force on inflation, said Tim McGee, chief economist at U.S. Trust, who expects the Fed's next move to be an easing of policy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials will receive one more consumer-price report, for August, in advance of their Sept. 20 FOMC meeting, as well as the July core personal-consumption-expenditures price index, their preferred inflation gauge. "Much will depend on the behavior of inflation before the meeting, both as measured by the PCE and as measured by the August inflation report," said Drew Matus of Lehman Brothers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consumer-price report showed July energy prices up 2.9% from June. Housing prices, which account for about 40% of the overall index, were up 0.3% in July. Owners' equivalent rent, which measures what homeowners could get by renting out their homes and a key factor in recent core gains, rose 0.4%. Higher energy and rental prices were offset by a 1.2% drop in clothing prices, the sharpest slide since 1988.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the U.S. Commerce Department reported housing starts fell 2.5% in July to a 1.795 million annual rate, the slowest pace since November 2004. Building permits, a leading indicator, dropped 6.5%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rounding out yesterday's reports, the Fed said industrial production rose 0.4% in July, half of June's gain and below expectations of a 0.6% increase.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, reflecting contained inflation expectations and the cumulative effects of monetary-policy actions and other factors restraining aggregate demand," the Fed said in a statement accompanying last week's decision.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coming on the heels of a drop in core producer prices Tuesday, the consumer-price data "offers a measure of vindication to the Federal Open Market Committee's decision," said Kenneth Beauchemin, economist at Global Insight. "Odds of a further rate hike in September are falling."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed officials "know the economy is losing momentum" and that its recent rate increases will act as a restraining force on inflation, said Tim McGee, chief economist at U.S. Trust, who expects the Fed's next move to be an easing of policy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials will receive one more consumer-price report, for August, in advance of their Sept. 20 FOMC meeting, as well as the July core personal-consumption-expenditures price index, their preferred inflation gauge. "Much will depend on the behavior of inflation before the meeting, both as measured by the PCE and as measured by the August inflation report," said Drew Matus of Lehman Brothers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consumer-price report showed July energy prices up 2.9% from June. Housing prices, which account for about 40% of the overall index, were up 0.3% in July. Owners' equivalent rent, which measures what homeowners could get by renting out their homes and a key factor in recent core gains, rose 0.4%. Higher energy and rental prices were offset by a 1.2% drop in clothing prices, the sharpest slide since 1988.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given the huge surge of home prices in recent years, this rise in the cost of housing seems light," said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics. "It would seem some 'catch-up' is likely, and that this is going to be a problem area of the CPI for a good while longer."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the U.S. Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell 2.5% in July to a 1.795 million annual rate, the slowest pace since November 2004. Building permits, a leading indicator, dropped 6.5%, the ninth decline in a year, suggesting that housing will subtract from gross domestic product in the second half of the year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rounding out yesterday's reports, the Fed said industrial production rose 0.4% in July, half of June's gain and below expectations of a 0.6% increase. Much of last month's gain was concentrated in utilities, while manufacturing output edged up just 0.1%, as stepped-up production of business equipment offset a decline in automobile output. The industrial capacity-utilization rate ticked up 0.1 percentage point to 82.4%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The general economy has slowed and the industrial economy is in the process of decelerating growth," said Daniel Meckstroth, chief economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI. "This, of course, is what the Federal Reserve wants in its quest to contain rising inflation."  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a rare bit of good news on the inflation front, the government offered a tame estimate of wholesale-price movement in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department's producer-price index for finished goods barely rose last month, increasing 0.1% after a 0.5% jump the previous month, as price declines for food, cars and prescription drugs offset increases for gasoline and electricity. It was the smallest increase in the wholesale-inflation gauge in five months, and it reduced the price index, which reflects wholesale prices charged by manufacturers and other suppliers, to 4.2% higher than a year ago, on an unadjusted basis, down from 4.9% in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The closely watched "core" measure of producer prices, excluding food and energy, fell 0.3% in July, the first decrease since October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets cheered that number as an early sign that the decision by Federal Reserve policy makers to hold interest rates steady this month -- a calculated gamble that past rate increases and slower economic expansion will keep inflation contained -- was the right one, and that future rate increases may not be necessary. Stock and bond prices rose as a result.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news wasn't all positive. While producer prices for finished goods were benign last month, inflationary pressures were evident further up the supply chain. Prices for crude goods were up 3.1% in July and were 6.6% higher than a year ago, while intermediate materials rose 0.5% last month and were up 8.9% from last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Producer and retail prices don't move in lockstep, and some reassuring measures of wholesale inflation in recent months were subsumed by more worrisome readings on consumer prices. The Labor Department today will release its estimate of consumer-price changes in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discounting by auto makers sent wholesale prices for passenger cars and light trucks lower last month, and food prices dropped, too. The price of eggs for fresh use has been particularly volatile -- plunging 26% last month following a 28% surge in June -- and is down nearly 17% during the last year. A surplus of chickens, the ebbing of the high-protein diet craze and competition from farmers selling processed-egg products are forcing fresh-egg producers to curb supply. "Economics is going to make that happen," said Paul Sauder, president of Sauder's Eggs, of Lititz, Pa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the National Association of Home Builders said its index of builder sentiment plummeted to a 15-year low. NAHB Chief Economist David Seiders attributed the drop to "potential buyers adopting a wait-and-see attitude because of uncertainty."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That uncertainty was echoed yesterday, when the National Association of Realtors reported the rate of existing-home sales was 7% lower in the second quarter compared with a year ago. A total of 28 states and the District of Columbia experienced a slower sales pace in the April-through-June period, while 20 states saw increased sales. Data were unavailable on the other two states. Three states with sizzling housing markets in recent years -- Arizona, Florida and California -- had the steepest declines.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Few Acres in Florida...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For $20 Million and Up</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AMID COOLING in much of Florida's high-end real-estate market, two waterfront lots have gone on sale for near-record asking prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late July, Reed Krakoff -- the executive creative director of Coach and one of three presidents at the handbag and accessories company -- put on the market a six-acre parcel in Palm Beach, on the Intracoastal Waterway. He is asking just below $20 million for the property, which has more than 175 feet of unobstructed water frontage. It's one of the few large undeveloped parcels remaining in Palm Beach, says listing agent Paulette Koch of Corcoran Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Krakoff bought the land for $9.4 million two years ago from the estate of Abraham Gosman, a former nursing-home developer who declared bankruptcy in 2001. (Another of Mr. Gosman's Palm Beach properties, a 43,000-square-foot mansion on the ocean side of the island, sold at auction for $41.4 million to Donald Trump in 2004.) About two acres of the Waterway site are developable. The Coach executive had cut some of the vegetation back on the property, but then shifted his attention to projects outside the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undeveloped parcels in Palm Beach have commanded high prices in recent years. Last year, a 3.9-acre parcel on the ocean side of the island sold for just below $25 million, and a two-acre property near Mr. Krakoff's sold for $22.8 million in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Palm Beach County, home sales exceeding $2 million fell 25% in the year so far, from year-earlier levels, according to Wallace Turner, a local broker who isn't involved in Mr. Krakoff's listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Golden Beach, for $26.6 MillionFifty miles down the coast, foreign investors are trying to sell another waterfront property for $26.6 million, 10 times what it fetched 14 years ago. The 1.7-acre parcel in Golden Beach, just north of Miami, lies on one of the only strips of oceanfront single-family homes in the area (the town building codes forbid high-rise developments).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property includes a four-bedroom ranch-style house, but Ralph Arias -- who's listing the home together with Carlos Justo, both of SOL Sotheby's International Realty -- said he expects a buyer to tear down the existing home. Local ordinances would allow as many as three homes on the site, which has 250 feet of ocean frontage. Mr. Arias would say only that the owner is a "foreign company." Public records list the owner as Delaware-registered Las Balmeras Inc., which paid nearly $2.7 million for the property in 1992. The prinicpals and the nature of the company couldn't be learned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the property fetches its asking price, the sale would approach the Miami-area record of $27 million, set earlier this year with the sale of a Miami Beach home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Linebacker Hits Hard Rock</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN DIEGO CHARGERS linebacker Shawne Merriman, the Associated Press's Defensive Rookie of the Year, has bought one of the first condos sold at the Hard Rock Hotel San Diego, under construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Merriman paid $469,000 for the one-bedroom apartment on the building's fifth floor. The 424-square-foot suite will come with rock-themed artwork and water views. Of the 420 units in the 12-story property in the city's downtown Gaslamp Quarter, 300 have sold, a spokeswoman says. (The complex will include a rooftop pool bar, a spa and a restaurant.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 22-year-old linebacker, whose primary home is in the Scripps Ranch neighborhood of San Diego, said he wanted a downtown apartment and was attracted by the development's "rock-star atmosphere." Mr. Merriman, who had 10 sacks in his first professional season, says he owns homes in Greenbelt, Md., and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hard Rock units come on the market at a time when San Diego's condo market is cooling. Sales of existing San Diego County condos fell 22% in June from the same month last year, according to data from the California Association of Realtors. The median sales price fell more than $26,000 (6.7%) in the same period. Many condo developers are trying to lure buyers by offering incentives, though Hard Rock said it isn't among them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The development, which won't be complete for another year, is the first condo-hotel of Hard Rock, which has nine hotels and casinos in operation or development. </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">As Data Point to Slowdown, Housing Market May Land Harder Than Economists Predict</span>
</div><div class="author">By Mark Whitehouse </div><div>1140 words</div><div>7 August 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York -- HOME PRICES in some parts of the country are falling. Builders are scaling back. Bubble or not, the biggest housing boom in recent U.S. history is coming to an end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now here is the big question: How bad will the aftermath be? At this point, most economists expect a "soft landing," a gradual decline that won't derail the nation's economic expansion, now in its fifth year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is a good chance they are being too optimistic. The boom has depended heavily on the upbeat psychology of consumers, builders and lenders. As moods swing, the landing could be very hard indeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We could be underestimating the dark side," says Mark Zandi, chief U.S. economist at Moody's Economy.com and among the first to seek to quantify the housing boom's broader effects. "Euphoria could turn into abject pessimism very quickly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With each passing data point, signs of the housing slowdown grow stronger. In June, total single-family-home sales fell 8.7% from a year earlier, to an annualized rate of 6.9 million -- the sharpest year-to-year drop since April 1995.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's report on second-quarter real gross domestic product, the inflation-adjusted value of the nation's output, showed that fixed investment in housing by companies and individuals declined at an annual rate of 6.3% in the quarter. That was a sharp change from a year earlier, when it was increasing at an annual rate of 20%. As of Friday, futures markets were predicting about a 5% drop in house prices by May 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, judging by most economists' forecasts, the fallout from a slowing housing market doesn't look all that unpleasant. Typically, they expect the decline in housing -- and housing-related activity -- to shave about a percentage point off inflation-adjusted GDP growth in 2007, compared with the estimated one percentage point the sector contributed to growth in 2005. If business investment and exports accelerate as expected, that would bring inflation-adjusted GDP growth to about 2.8% in 2007, down from a forecast 3.5% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists, however, have few clues on which to base their predictions. Today's housing boom differs radically from its predecessors. For one, it has been bigger and longer-lived. House prices are still more than twice the level of 1991, when the boom began. Even after the recent decline, June's rate of home sales is 40% above the 20-year average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the recent increase has been driven by an unprecedented flood of cash into U.S. capital markets. Global demand for U.S. mortgage bonds, competition among big national lenders and the advent of exotic loans have made it easier than ever to borrow money to buy a house -- and to turn rising home values into cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the market has risen so far, economists worry it has the potential to fall much harder than their main forecasts would suggest. As Janet Yellen, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, put it in a speech last week: "We can't ignore the risks of more unpleasant scenarios developing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One big question is how much the housing slowdown will affect consumers, whose spending accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy. If house prices plateau or fall, homeowners will feel poorer, and thus less willing to go out and buy more cars, boats and refrigerators. Typically, this "negative wealth effect" would be only about three to five cents of spending for each dollar of wealth lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But modern mortgage finance has magnified the effect of home values on spending, says Jan Hatzius, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs in New York. He estimates that when people take cash out of their homes through home-equity loans and refinancings -- which they were doing at an annualized rate of $558 billion in the first quarter -- they tend to spend about 50 cents of every dollar. If house prices merely stabilize, people's diminished ability to use their houses like automated-teller machines would subtract about 0.75 percentage point from annualized GDP growth in 2007, Mr. Hatzius says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another question is how fast home sales, and consequently home building, can fall. Even after the second-quarter decline, investment in residential construction accounted for about 6.1% of the economy -- close to a 50-year high. If, as some economists expect, housing investment merely returns to the long-term average of about 4.6% over the next two years, the decline also would shave 0.75 percentage point from annual real GDP growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is reason to believe home builders will have to pull back more sharply. That is because the leveling off of house prices changes the equation of homeownership. When mortgage rates were less than 6% and house prices were rising at about double that rate, people could reasonably expect to make more on their house's appreciation than they would pay in interest on their mortgages. Now, though, inflation-adjusted mortgage rates -- the interest rate on a typical 30-year mortgage minus the percentage rise in home prices -- are on track to turn positive for the first time since 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When housing took a similar turn in the 1970s, new-home sales quickly fell to their long-term norm. This time around, that would entail about a 50% decline in sales, says Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at consulting firm High Frequency Economics. He estimates that the resulting decline in residential construction would subtract about 1.5 percentage points from annual GDP growth in each of the next two years. "It's a 15-year bubble unwinding in two years," Mr. Shepherdson says. "It's going to hurt."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Messrs. Hatzius and Shepherdson are both right, the effect of the housing slowdown on construction and consumer spending alone would subtract more than two percentage points from economic growth in 2007, bringing it well below 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that isn't all. Economists can't quantify some risks, including the biggest: the chance that a sharp drop in house prices -- what economists call a "disorderly downturn" -- would leave many homeowners owing more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. If that led to a wave of foreclosures and losses on riskier mortgage-backed securities, banks and investors could get spooked and cut back on all kinds of lending -- a move that could snuff out economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For me, the risk of a disorderly downturn is the greater one," Mr. Hatzius says. "That's a scenario that people would worry about a lot, because typically recessions are the result of a general unwillingness to lend." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- The latest data on mortgage applications and investor-money flows spell more bad news for home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Mortgage Bankers Association report, released yesterday, shows mortgage applications in the week ended July 28 fell to their lowest level in more than four years. The MBA's Market Composite Index, which measures mortgage-loan application volume, slipped to 527.6 on a seasonally adjusted basis -- its lowest level since May 2002. On an unadjusted basis, the index was down 29% from the year-earlier period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline came even though the average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.62% from 6.69% the previous week, and the average 15-year fixed rate mortgage was 6.28%, down from 6.31%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The MBA's Purchase Index, which measures new and existing home sales, fell to 376.2 -- its lowest level since November 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UBS analyst Margaret Whelan said demand still remains relatively healthy on a historical basis. However, she said consumer sentiment is "more fragile" as a result of increased inventory levels and constrained affordability. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael Corkery and Dongjin Park </div><div>624 words</div><div>28 July 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales fell last month, while a major measure of business spending grew at slower pace, reinforcing the view that the economy is slowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Census Bureau reported that new-home sales fell 3% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.13 million units. Moreover, sales in May were revised sharply lower to an annual rate of 1.17 million units from the preliminary estimate of 1.23 million units. On Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing, or previously owned, homes declined 1.3% in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most economists agreed that the two housing reports clearly show that the market is cooling, they disagreed on whether the data point to a soft or hard landing for housing. Patrick Newport, an economist at Global Insight, an economic consulting firm based in Lexington, Mass., says unit sales of new homes dropped off more sharply earlier in the year, but the slowdown has been less dramatic in recent months. In his view, "the slowdown is more gradual than we had been anticipating."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other economists, however, focused less on unit sales and more on the decelerating pace of price appreciation. The median new-home price in June increased 2.3% from June 2005, while the realtors reported that the price of existing homes last month increased 0.9% from last year. That compares with a year-over-year median price increase for a new home in Sept. 2005 of roughly 13.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I would be personally stretched to describe this as orderly," says Haseeb Ahmed, U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co. "It's been pretty sharp," he said. "In the last two or three months, things have come down rapidly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday's new-home sales report also showed sharp variation in sales by region. Sales were down 11.3% in the Northeast, 7.9% in the Midwest and 6% in the South, but were up 8.2% in the West. The report showed the inventory of new homes for sale at the end of June hit a record 566,000 units, which represents a 6.1-months supply at the current sales rate. While June's supply is much higher than last year's levels, it is down from the 6.4 month supply in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other economic news, the Commerce Department reported that new orders for durable-goods, or big-ticket items, rose a larger-than-expected 3.1% last month to $216.3 billion, after May's 0.3% increase. The May figure was revised from a previously estimated 0.2% decrease. The June figure reflects a sharp increase in defense capital goods and civilian aircraft orders, which were up 51.2% and 8.8%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because aircraft and defense orders can be highly volatile, economists tend to pay more attention to orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, a key barometer of business spending. That increased 0.4% in June, sharply lower than May's 1.3% rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits fell by 7,000 to 298,000 in the week that ended July 22. In a newsletter emailed to clients, economists at Bear, Stearns &amp;Co. said the jobless numbers are "difficult to read because of the volatility induced by summer auto plant closures." Still, they concluded that "the last two weeks of claims data suggest that employment gains in July may be somewhat stronger than those seen in the last three months." The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release the July employment report next Friday. </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales declined last month while inventories swelled to the highest levels since 1997, the latest sign that the housing market continues to cool. Consumer confidence, meanwhile, stabilized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing, or previously owned, homes fell 1.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.62 million units in June from a revised 6.71 million in May. When compared with June 2005, sales were down 8.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors' Chief Economist David Lereah says that for now, the housing market appears headed for a soft landing in most markets, meaning that the market will cool in an orderly fashion. But if the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates while consumers get hit with higher oil prices, "some local economies could turn sluggish and contract," which could result in a harder landing for housing, Mr. Lereah said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices, meanwhile, were little changed overall but varied considerably by region. The national median existing home price was $231,000 in June, up 0.9% from June 2005. That was the slowest monthly year-over-year price increase since May 1995.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Northeast, where sales declined 3.5% in the month, the median price was $298,000, up 7.2% from a year ago. In the South, where sales were down 2.3% in the month, the median price was down 0.5% from June 2005 to $191,000. In the Midwest, last month's sales were unchanged from May, while the median home price was down 1.7% to $175,000 from a year ago. Last month's sales in the West were unchanged from May and the median price was $342,000, the same as a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's clear that we've seen a very significant slowdown [in price appreciation] and may be approaching an episode of overall declines," says Richard DeKaser, chief economist at National City Corp. in Cleveland. He added that "I would call this, thus far, a very orderly correction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, inventories rose 3.8% to 3.73 million existing homes for sale in June, which is a 6.8-month supply of homes at the current sales pace. That was the highest inventory level since July 1997 and compares with a 4.4-month supply in June 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence unexpectedly edged up in July as consumers shrugged off rising gas prices and higher interest rates. The Conference Board, an independent business-research group in New York, said its index of consumer confidence rose to 106.5 in July from June's revised 105.4.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp;Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOENIX REALTY GROUP of New York is a real-estate investment firm. A headline yesterday incorrectly referred to Phoenix as a REIT, or real-estate investment trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ July 27, 2006)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END) </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A real-estate investment firm is financing "work-force housing" for middle-income residents in and around some of the nation's priciest markets: Los Angeles, San Diego and most recently in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fresh from raising $243 million in three funds that will invest in California, Phoenix Realty Group, of New York, has started a $250 million fund looking to attract institutional money or investments from high-net-worth individuals to finance for-sale and rental housing, in addition to mixed-use developments in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is too early to judge the success of the Phoenix funds -- the first housing units open in September in Los Angeles -- but they have attracted some heavy-hitting investors. Citibank, the California Public Employees' Retirement System and MetLife Inc. have invested in the California funds, and Citibank is considering investing in the Northeast fund, called the Metropolitan Workforce Housing Fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While government subsidies have helped create affordable housing for decades, many of those units target lower-income residents. J. Michael Fried, Phoenix's chief executive officer, says the Northeast fund will focus on housing for a more middle-income bracket -- "the policemen and firemen and teachers who would like to buy something, but no one has built something with them in mind." In Los Angeles, Phoenix-funded developments target two demographic groups: civil servants and young couples looking to buy their first home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix was started in 2000, not long after Mr. Fried left his post as chief executive of CharterMac, a publicly traded real-estate finance company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix is targeting prospective homeowners whose household income is 80% to 200% of the area's median income. In New York City, for instance, the median household income in 2004 was $41,509, according to the U.S. Census. Phoenix says this work-force market is ripe, as high home prices and rising interest rates have put homeownership out of reach of many Americans, especially those living near large coastal cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Northeast, Phoenix is looking to invest in developments in the outlying New York boroughs or in cities like Port Chester, N.Y., or Hartford, Conn. The median price of a home the Phoenix fund intends to invest in is about $400,000. That compares with a median condo and co-op price in Manhattan of $880,000 in the second quarter, according to Miller Samuel Inc., a New York appraisal company. In Queens, the median existing-home price is $581,000, and it is $424,900 in Essex County, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fried's strategy is to invest in several small-sized developments that typically wouldn't attract institutional money. Mr. Fried says Phoenix coaches developers to reduce costs by shrinking unit size, building on less-costly land on the periphery of high-priced neighborhoods, and putting in more modest amenities, such as Chinese-made granite countertops instead of Italian ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix's strategy makes sense to Andrew Ditton, director of Citibank's community-development business. "What they have been able to do is identify what is clearly a market need," Mr. Ditton says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fried says Phoenix typically accepts investments of $5 million or more from high-net-worth individuals and $10 million or more from institutions. The annualized rate of return on the work-force fund is in the "midteens," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't match the 20% or higher returns luxury developments typically have offered private-equity firms, Mr. Ditton says, largely because building inexpensive housing in an area with high land and construction costs drives down returns. Still, he says demand for work-force housing is likely to remain strong compared with high-end units, where demand is more limited and showing signs of softening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citibank has another motivation to invest. Mr. Ditton says the new housing developments in the New York area's outlying neighborhoods could one day create a market for new bank branches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fried says one of the biggest risks to the fund is the inexperience of some of the developers. "In many cases, the deal they are doing [with Phoenix] is the biggest deal they have done," he says. Phoenix recently hired Ralph Raciti, a former executive at Pulte Homes Inc., to oversee its Northeast projects, scout out deals and work with developers, which could include community-development groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The California funds have invested or plan to invest in roughly 4,300 housing units in the state, most of them for-sale homes with an average sales price of $415,000. That compares to a median home price of $580,140 in June in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Northeast, Mr. Fried says he is looking to invest in both for-sale housing and rental apartments, given the strengthening rental market as rising interest rates prompt would-be home buyers to consider renting instead. "Our business model allows us to be flexible," he says. </p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>1379 words</div><div>20 July 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no sign of a broad collapse of housing prices about a year after the once-hot coastal markets entered a long-anticipated cooling phase. But the general level of prices is edging down in some areas and leveling off in others, while the supply of homes for sale keepsrising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes on the market in Orlando, Fla., for example, is nearly five times the year-earlier level, while the inventory has quadrupled in Phoenix and Tampa, Fla., and nearly tripled in the Washington, D.C., area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another sign of the housing market's growing weakness, the Commerce Department said housing starts fell 5.3% last month from May, to an annual rate of 1.85 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One effect of the softening in many markets is that more sellers are willing to dicker. "Let's make a smoking deal," John Nichols wrote in a Craigslist.org ad for his three-bedroom ranch house in Sacramento, Calif., this week. He is seeking $315,000 but adds, "Make an offer. You won't necessarily insult me." Although the backyard is "currently a dump," Mr. Nichols says, the kitchen countertops are granite and the dual-pane windows are new.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To examine the residential real-estate prospects for 26 major metro areas, The Wall Street Journal gathered data on inventories of homes for sale at the end of the second quarter from a variety of local sources; pricing trends based on surveys of real-estate agents by Daniel Oppenheim, an analyst at Banc of America Securities in New York, a unit of Bank of America Corp.; and projections of job creation by Moody's Economy.com, a research firm in West Chester, Pa. Employment trends are among the most important factors in determining demand for housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metro areas showing large increases of homes for sale and relatively weak employment growth include Boston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and New York. Among the strongest markets overall are Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth and Seattle. All three areas are benefiting from robust job markets, and modest home prices are drawing investors and new residents to Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Massachusetts, where the job market is flagging, the median sale price for single-family detached homes in May was down 1.2% from a year earlier and nearly 6% below the peak reached in July 2005, according to the state's Association of Realtors. The supply of homes available for sale in May was enough to last 11.3 months at the current sales pace, up from 8.7 months a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A June survey of real-estate agents by Banc of America Securities found that home prices had weakened from the prior month in 30 of the 42 metropolitan areas covered. The markets with the weakest pricing trends included Boston, Detroit, Phoenix, St. Louis and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Miami prices have been about flat in recent months, says Ronald A. Shuffield, president of the brokerage firm Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell Inc. Mr. Shuffield says he expects prices of condos in less-attractive parts of the Miami area to fall slightly in coming months. For condos in better parts of the area, he believes prices during the next year will range from about flat to as much as 5% higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So many new homes are available on the outskirts of Phoenix that it is "a total bloodbath," says Ivy Zelman, a Cleveland-based housing analyst for Credit Suisse Group. She doesn't see a recovery in most major metro areas in the near term. "It could actually get worse before it gets better," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conditions can vary considerably within a metropolitan area and among different types of housing. Sherry Chris, chief operating officer of Prudential California Realty, says condo prices in downtown San Francisco are about level with a year ago because new buildings have helped supply catch up with demand. Overall, the number of homes on the market in the Bay Area has more than doubled from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the suburb of Palo Alto, where the median home price is nearly $1.4 million, the inventory of homes has declined 2% from a year ago. Ms. Chris says she believes that reflects lots of hiring by Google Inc. and other technology firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the 26 metro areas, Orlando shows the biggest surge in inventory. But the supply was unusually lean a year ago, says Beverly Pindling, president of the Orlando Regional Realtors Association, and job growth is very strong. Ms. Pindling says prices in the Orlando area generally are down about 3% to 7% from a year ago. Home builders, eager to make sales, are "romancing the Realtors," she says; some are offering agents who bring in buyers commissions of up to 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kent Fowler, a real-estate agent and investor in Washington, is bracing for an extended period of pain. Construction was recently completed on a condo near the city's Chinatown district that he bought in 2004 for $629,000. Mr. Fowler believes the two-bedroom condo, with a view of the Washington Monument, now is worth at least $800,000. But potential buyers are scarce in today's glutted market. So he is trying to find a renter for the condo for the next year or two at around $3,500 a month, even though that rental income would fall about $900 short of his monthly loan payments, condo fees, taxes and insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some sellers are advertising prices below recently appraised values, and others are offering to help pay closing costs for buyers who are short on cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Realtors say the media have overplayed weakness in the market. Richard A. Smith, vice chairman and president of Realogy Corp., the real-estate brokerage business due to be spun off from Cendant Corp. soon, says 2006 "will be the third best year in the history of the business" in terms of total home sales, despite the cooling trend. The National Association of Realtors projects that sales of previously owned homes will fall 6.7% from last year's record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many investors have been scared out of the market, Mr. Smith says, plenty of other people must buy new houses because of changes in their lives, such as a new job or a divorce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others sound more cautious. "I do think we're going to see some tougher times ahead," says Scott Anderson, senior economist at Wells Fargo &amp;Co. in Minneapolis. By August, he says, most cities in California will be showing modest declines from a year earlier in home prices, and prices also may decline further in parts of Florida, Nevada, Arizona and the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Headlines about falling prices could make buyers more aggressive in negotiating and persuade some sellers to "get out with what they can," Mr. Anderson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Anderson expects the current downswing to last into next year; by late 2007, he thinks the market will be stabilizing. Though he doesn't expect a recession in the next couple of years, he says the housing market would be much weaker if one occurs. In the past, steep declines in home prices have tended to hit only metropolitan areas that have suffered major job losses, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Wheaton, a housing economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says the wild cards include how many investors or second-home owners will dump properties on the market and how many borrowers will default. Even if there is no surge in defaults or selling by investors, he says, some of the formerly hot local markets may be heading into five or 10 years of flat to slightly higher home prices. He believes many baby boomers on the coasts will cash out of expensive homes and move to cheaper areas; that would restrain price increases along the coasts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KIM BRONSON'S West Windsor, Vt., home has everything a buyer might expect in a pastoral North Country property: a five-bedroom, Federal-era main house, several fenced horse paddocks and four guest cottages. It's located just 12 miles south of Woodstock, a vacation spot known for its quaint New England charm. It even has a celebrity pedigree. Ms. Bronson shared the home with her late husband, actor Charles Bronson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only thing the property doesn't have is a buyer. Ms. Bronson put her home on the market more than a year ago at $4.9 million, then shaved the price by $1 million in April. "I'm really surprised it hasn't sold," she says. "I don't think Vermont and New England is going with the same real-estate flow as the rest of the universe."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the market is slowing in many parts of the country, where higher interest rates and inventory buildup have helped cool the once hot real-estate market. But in New England, there is a distinct chill -- with additional factors contributing to the slowdown, economists and real-estate professionals say. A persistent exodus of residents and a stagnant economy across the region are depressing home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate landscape in New England is diverse, of course. Sluggish sales of Colonials in Camden, Maine, say, are at times unrelated to the market for row houses in Boston's South End or Victorians in Hartford, Conn. The region's income levels vary wildly, too, with often only a mile or two separating affluent enclaves from hardscrabble tracts. Even so, sales volume across New England fell sharply in the first five months of the year, with the region's biggest states posting broad declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Massachusetts, single-family-home sales fell 9.3% through May compared with the same period a year earlier, according to figures from Warren Group, a Boston real-estate news publisher that compiles housing statistics. Sales in the Cape Cod and Worcester areas saw steep drop-offs, 17.8% and 12.5% respectively. In Connecticut, sales volume fell 11% in the first five months of the year, compared with the same period a year earlier, Warren Group reports. Fairfield County -- home to pricey towns such as Greenwich, New Canaan and Westport -- saw a 17% sales drop, compared with the same 2005 period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Heiblien has been trying to sell his four-bedroom home in Mystic, Conn., since January. As in many of the small towns that dot the Connecticut shore, the number of for-sale signs in tiny Mystic (pop. 4,001) has doubled since then, area brokers say. Mr. Heiblien, a 46-year-old private ferry operator, says he anticipated a slowing market when he listed the property for $515,000. But, he says, he "never dreamed" he'd need to cut the home's asking price four times before finding a buyer. The property went under contract last week for $405,000. "I really thought the market was stronger when I put the home up for sale," says Mr. Heiblien. "I had to adjust."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate market has slowed in many parts of the U.S., of course. The National Association of Realtors predicts existing-home sales across the country will be down this year by 6.7% from 2005, a downgrade from the 4.4% drop the group forecast in January. Nowhere has the drop-off been more striking than in California and Florida, states that led the boom years and are now experiencing precipitous sales declines after years of building and, in many cases, speculation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The factors behind New England's slowdown, however, are more complicated. For starters, its economy appears to be stalling, researchers say, at a time when the country as a whole maintains a relatively strong economic outlook. A recent report issued by the New England Economic Partnership cites continued weakening in the manufacturing, leisure and hospitality industries, three of the region's important economic engines, through 2010, resulting in slightly higher unemployment numbers. Growth in total employment is expected to average 0.9% per year, compared to the national average of 1.3% over the forecast period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the pool of potential home-buyers in the region is "falling like a stone," says New Hampshire-based demographer Peter Francese. He cites U.S. Census Bureau data showing almost 200,000 residents between 25 and 44 years of age left the region between 2000 and 2004. All six New England states show declines in that category, with Maine, Vermont, and Connecticut far outpacing the national average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No wonder the real-estate scene in New England -- where home prices climbed at least twice as fast as household income during the run-up -- is frosty. The population flight "weighs on the region's economy and housing market," says Mark Zandi, an economist with Moody's Economy.com. The collapse in housing affordability, he says, has driven out first-time home-buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Englanders have been slow to budge, with many sellers reluctant to cut prices; in spite of the slowing market, median sales prices have yet to fall, holding steady at $310,000 through May. Such reluctance is especially true at the high end, brokers say, where sellers are often in a position to wait.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melanie Eleftherio's renovated five-bedroom home in Newport, R.I., has been on the market for almost a year at $1.3 million. Though the 1860s Victorian includes new bathrooms and a renovated kitchen, the property -- sandwiched between the ocean and the Bellevue Avenue mansions -- has failed to fetch a single serious offer. But the 46-year-old former advertising executive isn't ready to cut the asking price. "The home is priced right for the market," Ms. Eleftherio says. "Serious buyers will recognize that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers across the region who handle expensive properties say sellers like Ms. Eleftherio are often waiting far longer than the national average of six to eight weeks to find buyers. Indeed, sales data from Warren Group show steep declines in luxury-home sales. Through May, 327 homes priced at $1.5 million sold in Massachusetts, down from 363 during the same period a year earlier. Eleven homes in that category sold in Rhode Island, down from 17 a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even sellers with star power are striking out. Boston Red Sox slugger Manny Ramirez has been trying to unload his 4,500-square-foot condominium apartment in Boston since June 2005, according to Jason S. Weissman, of Boston Realty Advisors, who has the listing. Though the four-bedroom, 37th-floor penthouse has been on the market for more than a year, Mr. Ramirez hasn't reduced its $5.7 million price tag. "He's prepared to wait in order to get his price," says Mr. Weissman. "The market will ultimately judge if he does."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market will continue to cool down after the multiyear boom, with slower price increases and fewer housing starts as interest rates move up, according to a report by the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are coming off a very strong couple of years for the housing industry, and markets are now starting to cool to more sustainable levels," wrote David Seiders, chief economist of the Washington trade association representing home-construction companies. "Each market has different factors that affect its local economy and housing market, but overall we are forecasting an orderly slowdown in housing starts," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of a home increased 13.2% last year and 10.8% in 2004, driven by coastal markets, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. But that pace is expected to cool in 2006 and 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Higher house prices together with higher interest rates have dampened housing demand throughout most of the country, bringing demand more in line with supply," according to the home builders report. "Already there are reports of downward pressure, or at least reduced upward pressure, on housing prices around the country."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher mortgage rates have helped take some of the steam out of housing. The 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.79% for the week ended July 6, according to mortgage lender Freddie Mac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also examines the housing market on a state-by-state basis. While housing starts are expected to fall nationally after hitting their highest level in more than 30 years in 2005, states such as Idaho, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Washington and Wyoming are expected to see home construction increase this year, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic forecast for California isn't as positive because the state already has expensive home prices and an overall high cost of living, the report added. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A gauge of future home sales turned upward, indicating that the housing market is stabilizing, and the country's job market showed healthy signs, according to economic data released yesterday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' index for pending sales of existing homes increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.3% to 113.4 in May from April's 111.9. The latest index was 10.1% below the year-earlier level. While lower than a year ago, the reading's monthly gain suggests that the housing sector -- a key contributor to the economy -- is cooling gently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The slight change in pending home sales indicates the market is beginning to level out," said David Lereah, the NAR's chief economist. "This is consistent with our forecast, which is showing a soft landing for the housing sector."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, the index showed a 0.6% drop in the Northeast in May from April and a 7.8% decline since May 2005. In the West, the index increased 9.9% in May but was 12.9% below the prior year. The South fell 1.7% in May and was 7.3% below May 2005. The Midwest climbed 0.6% in May but was down 13.6% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR index of pending home sales is based on contracts signed in May for the sale of existing homes, including single-family units and condominiums. A home sale is pending when the contract has been signed but the transaction hasn't closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the job market also received some positive news. Initial jobless claims decreased by 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 313,000 in the week ended July 1, the Labor Department said. New claims for the week ended June 24 were 315,000, revised from a previously reported 313,000. Wall Street expectations had projected jobless claims would rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government will release its snapshot for June employment today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, though, the service sector showed signs that it expanded at a slower pace last month. The Institute for Supply Management reported that its nonmanufacturing index fell to 57% in June from 60.1% in May. That is the lowest level since January. The ISM also reported that new orders declined in the service sector, suggesting a softer performance in the months ahead. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Today's Market Forecast]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing Foundations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The health of the economy and stock market in the second half will depend in part on how much the housing sector slows. And so far, the data are sending a mixed message.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some "supply side" housing indicators suggest the sector has weakened considerably. The National Association of Home Builders, for instance, produces an index of homebuilder confidence that in June slipped to its lowest level in more than a decade. Last week Lennar joined a parade of builders lowering its 2006 earnings outlook. And the Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction index of home-builder stocks has fallen by more than 30% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But "demand side" reports suggest the market isn't terribly soft. Last week the Commerce Department reported new home sales rose for the third month in a row, though they are still 5.9% lower than a year ago. Existing home sales -- the sales of previously owned homes -- have also dropped from a year ago, but haven't collapsed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's report on pending home sales from the National Association of Realtors -- a newish housing indicator that economists are watching closely -- could give fresh insight on the severity of the slowdown in demand. Unlike existing home sales, which are based on sales that have closed, the pending sales index is based on contracts sellers have accepted, most of which will close one or two months later. As a result, it is a bit more timely than existing home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For April, the index was 11.7% below its year-ago level. That's more severe than the declines in new and existing sales, but the pace of mortgage applications suggests today's report could show the index steadied in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may be that the weakness experienced by the builders is self-imposed. J.P. Morgan economist Haseeb Ahmed points out the disparity between supply-side indicators -- the number of houses under construction, lumber prices, home-builder guidance -- and demand-side indicators. It could mean high inventories of unsold houses will be worked off quickly, bringing the housing market back to health before long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another possibility: Sales volumes have been driven by price reductions. That also could bring housing back into balance, but leave lots of homeowners unhappy.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Mark Whitehouse </div><div>1581 words</div><div>5 July 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither resurgent inflation nor a housing slowdown is likely to throw the economy completely off track, but they will make life a lot tougher for Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, economists said in a new survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal's latest survey of 56 forecasters, conducted in mid-June, suggests an economy at a crossroads, with growth looking set to slow but inflation accelerating. That makes the Fed's actions on short-term interest rates the biggest question mark in many economists' outlooks, because the central bank faces the difficult task of figuring out which is more important: putting a lid on prices or keeping the economy humming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We know the Fed's grappling with these two problems, the weak growth and the high inflation," says Ethan Harris, chief U.S. economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. "There's a lot of uncertainty about which war they're going to fight."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consensus forecast of the 56 economists is that growth in real gross domestic product -- a broad measure of economic activity, adjusted for inflation -- will ease to an annualized 2.9% in the second half of 2006. That compares with an annualized 5.6% in the first quarter and an expected 2.8% in the second quarter, which would bring first-half growth to about 4.2%. By the first half of next year, growth would cool further to 2.7%, the slowest rate since mid-2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, new data suggested that manufacturing, while continuing to expand, did cool during the second quarter, as did construction spending. The government will report an advance estimate of second-quarter GDP on July 28.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The forecasters expect nonfarm businesses to add an average of about 140,000 jobs in each of the next 12 months. That rate would not be enough to keep the unemployment rate from rising to 4.8% by next May from 4.6% in May 2006. Asked what they thought was most likely to happen with consumer prices, three-quarters of the forecasters said they thought inflation would surge before ebbing as the economy cools. They expect year-on-year inflation to be 3.1% in November, and to average 2.5% over the next 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, new information about the hiring situation will arrive as the government releases its snapshot of June employment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combination of slowing growth and rising inflation has made economists less certain of their benign predictions. On average, they said they were 63% confident in their forecasts for GDP growth, down from 68% a year ago. Together, they put the odds of a recession in the next year at one in five, double the probability of a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overarching concern: With energy prices high, consumers heavily in debt and the housing market overextended, the U.S. economy could prove susceptible to an unexpected shock. "We're at a point where there are strains, so we're more vulnerable should a shock occur," says Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forecasters offered a litany of potential threats, from a widespread outbreak of avian flu to a geopolitically motivated energy crisis. But the most prevalent concern was that the Fed, zealous to beat inflation under a new chairman working to earn inflation-fighting credentials, will take interest rates too high and tip the economy into recession. In the survey, 12 of the 56 participants named a monetary-policy mistake as the greatest risk looming over the economy in the next 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worries about the Fed have risen along with interest rates: In the Journal's last two surveys, forecasters underestimated how high the central bank would take its short-term interest-rate target. Last week, the Fed lifted its short-term interest rate target to 5.25%, the 17th consecutive increase of the rate, which is charged on overnight loans between banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Rates have gone up more than I expected, so I'm more concerned that they're going to overshoot," says Maury Harris, chief U.S. economist at UBS. Forecasters see about a 50% chance that the Fed's target rate will hit 5.50% by the end of the year; at 6.25%, they put the chances of a recession at better than even.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dilemma facing the Fed is typical for a central bank in the middle of an economic expansion. Strong growth has allowed it to end a long period of unusually low interest rates that was aimed at stimulating the economy by making money cheap and easy to borrow. The steady rise in interest rates does seem to have started some cooling in the economy. When central bankers started their campaign to raise short-term interest rates two years ago, the rates stood at 1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further increases will bring rates to a level that most economists see as a brake on growth. So if the Fed takes them higher to battle inflation, in their view, it also will sacrifice some prosperity. How much is anybody's guess, because interest-rate moves can take as long as two years to work through the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a shift from previous statements, Fed officials haven't signaled a bias in what they will do. In a statement accompanying its increase last week, the Fed said "the extent and timing of any additional" rate increases "will depend on the evolution for both inflation and economic growth."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, for the most part, economists voiced a generally high opinion of Mr. Bernanke's ability to find the right balance. They gave the new Fed chairman a grade of "B-plus" for his interest-rate decisions so far, and 31 of the 56 polled said they expect the Fed to whip inflation with only a limited impact on growth. Just 14 said they think it will go too far and damage the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some noted that even if the Fed chooses to stifle economic growth, it won't necessarily be in error. Resurgent inflation could force the central bank's hand -- a possibility that eight forecasters saw as the greatest risk to the economy. Several of those envisioning this scenario noted that the unprecedented rise in housing prices over the past decade and a half has only just begun to seep into consumer prices, in the form of higher rents. High home prices, together with higher interest rates, have made homeownership unaffordable for many, increasing demand for rental properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Fed under [former Chairman Alan] Greenspan ignored the rising price of houses, which clearly was the result of very easy monetary policy," says Paul Kasriel, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. "Now it's paying for it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond that, two forces that many economists believe have kept inflation in check -- globalization and booming productivity -- could now be ebbing or even pushing the other way. Chinese companies whose inexpensive exports have helped hold down consumer-goods prices in the U.S. are now helping put upward pressure on capital-goods prices as they expand their production facilities. And as U.S. companies become less able to squeeze more out of their existing workers, some are starting to hire more workers, a trend that could ultimately push up wages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under Mr. Greenspan, the forces of globalization and productivity "allowed us to have lower unemployment and lower inflation and higher growth all at the same time," says Allen Sinai, chief global economist at consultancy Decision Economics. "Chairman Bernanke unfortunately does not have that luxury."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the latest readings on manufacturing and housing confirmed some cooling in the second quarter. The Institute for Supply Management, a purchasing managers' trade group, said its manufacturing activity index slipped to 53.8 in June, down from 54.4 in May and 57.3 in April. Any level above 50 suggests the manufacturing sector is growing, but the latest data confirm it did so at a slower rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that construction spending in May fell 0.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.2 trillion, pulled down by slower residential building, the first time in more than three years construction spending has fallen for two consecutive months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other survey findings:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Forecasters remain stock investors. Almost half, 27, had more than half their investments in the stock market, down just a bit from 29 in December. The majority expect the Dow Jones Industrial Average to end the year between 11000 and 12000, though about a third think it could be below 11000. The industrials ended at 11228.02 Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Corporate-profit growth is expected to slow. The consensus calls for profits to rise 14.5% in 2006, then slow to growth of 4.4% in 2007. They rose 16.4% in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Forecasters expect the dollar to weaken slightly. They see it buying 107 yen, and a euro costing $1.29, in June 2007. As of Monday, a dollar bought 114.65 yen and a euro cost $1.2807.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Oil prices are expected to ease to about $61 a barrel by mid-2007. As of Friday, oil was $73.93 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing homes fell in May for the seventh time in nine months as interest rates rose, but the mood of the consumer brightened a bit in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes in May were at a 6.67 million annual rate, down 1.2% from April, the National Association of Realtors said. "Although mortgage interest rates remain historically low, the uptrend in interest rates this year is affecting those buyers who are at the margins of affordability," NAR's chief economist, David Lereah, said. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in May was 6.6%, up from 6.5% in April, according to Freddie Mac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Conference Board said its consumer-confidence index, which had decreased in May, posted a slight increase in June. Consumer attitudes toward the state of the economy deteriorated, but their outlook improved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors said the inventory of unsold homes on the market increased to 6.5 months, from April's revised 6.1 months. A rule of thumb in the industry is that there is a buyer's market any time the inventory of unsold homes exceeds six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price increased to $230,000, up 3.6% from a revised $222,000 in April and 6% above the May 2005 level of $217,000. The median existing condo price was $229,300 in May, up 1.9% from the year-earlier level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales fell 3.8% in the Midwest and 4.2% in the Northeast, and they rose 0.7% in the West and 0.4% in the South. The report came a day after the government reported that sales of newly built homes rose 4.6% in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board's consumer-confidence index now stands at 105.7, up from 104.7 in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The slight bounce back in confidence this month was a result of the moderate improvement in consumers' expectations," said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center. "Despite the uptick, consumers remain concerned about the short-term outlook. Furthermore, the Present Situation Index lost ground for the second consecutive month, a signal that the economy is shifting into lower gear heading into the second half of this year." </p>

</div><div class="author">By Campion Walsh  </div><div>372 words</div><div>27 June 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>11</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. new-home sales unexpectedly rose in May at their fastest pace since December, as sales climbed sharply in the South and the West.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes increased 4.6% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.2 million, the Commerce Department said. Year to year, new-home sales were still down 5.9% from the pace in May 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street had expected a drop in sales last month. The median estimate of 11 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and CNBC was for the May data to show a 4% decline from the previous month to a 1.150 million annual rate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists are watching U.S. housing data closely to gauge the magnitude of an anticipated slowdown in residential real-estate activity following years of torrid market growth that has buoyed U.S. consumer sentiment and spending.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unexpected increase in new-home sales could have an effect on U.S. monetary policy. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise short-term interest rates again when it meets tomorrow and Thursday, extending a two-year credit-tightening cycle in an effort to restrain inflation. But the course of the housing market could be a major influence on future decisions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the statement accompanying its last rate increase, in May, the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said slower U.S. economic growth was likely, "reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the direction of housing-market indicators hasn't been uniform, so far this year's data generally have shown a slowdown. Last week, the National Association of Home Builders reported its index for new-home sales fell to its lowest level in more than 11 years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In yesterday's report on new-home sales, the Commerce Department said U.S. May sales climbed 6% in the South, reaching their highest point since October. Meanwhile, sales were up 5.3% in the West, reaching their higest point since January, and they were up 2.7% in the Midwest.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Christopher Conkey </div><div>492 words</div><div>27 June 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales rose in May for the third consecutive month as many buyers took advantage of developer incentives, but another major home builder lowered its earnings expectations due to weakening demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said sales of new homes last month increased 4.6% from April to an annual rate of 1.23 million units, following slightly larger advances in the two preceding months. Even with the recent rebound, the pace of new-home sales last month was 5.9% lower than a year earlier, and the housing market in general still appears to be softening from last year's peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discounts and other incentives appear to have boosted sales in recent months, but rising mortgage rates and slower economic growth have many builders cautious about the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami-based builder Lennar Corp. yesterday reported that a 53% jump in second-quarter home sales lifted its quarterly profit 33% to $324.7 million, or $2 a share, from $243.5 million, or $1.48 a share, a year earlier. Greater use of incentives, however, trimmed Lennar's gross margin on home sales by 1.4 percentage point in the quarter. The company lowered its full-year earnings outlook to a range of $8 to $8.25 a share -- down from $9.25 a share -- saying it expects weaker orders and higher cancellation rates in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar Chief Executive Stuart Miller said many potential buyers have decided that now is not the "best time to make that strategic purchase," and he cited a "wholesale evaporation" of speculators from many markets, which he said will eventually be a "healthy thing" for the industry. Longer term, he said "favorable demographic trends and high employment levels bode well" for builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists were surprised that new-home sales rose again in May, but many still expect sales to weaken over the course of the year despite continued builder incentives aimed at luring buyers. "It's not just higher interest rates making housing less affordable, it's also the rapid rise of prices," said Steve Wood, chief economist at consultancy Insight Economics, Danville, Calif. "The incentives builders are giving have to fight against both those trends."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In keeping with higher sales rates and bigger discounts seen in recent months, the median price of a new home fell to $235,000 in May from $245,900 in April, and stood 3% higher than a year earlier. Higher sales since this spring have, however, started to reduce the number of unsold new homes on the market. In May, there was a 5.5-month supply of unsold homes available, down from a 6.4-month supply in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The South is the only region that has seen a higher rate of new-home sales compared to a year ago. The Northeast has seen the steepest decline. </p>

</p><div>THE OUTLOOK</div>
<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">A Housing Slowdown Can Put the Brakes on a Job Sector but Open Other Opportunities</span>
</div><div class="author">By Mark Whitehouse </div><div>881 words</div><div>26 June 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MORTGAGE BROKERS, prepare your resumes. And while you are at it, highlight any experience you've had in health care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason: Housing, the biggest generator of jobs in the current expansion, is running out of steam. As a result, tens of thousands of Americans, from bankers to hardware-store clerks, are likely to find themselves out of work over the next couple of years. For those who can transfer their skills to other industries that are still growing, such as health care, it won't be the end of the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not going to be a big show-stopper, because there are other areas of the economy that are picking up," says Brian Bethune, U.S. economist at consulting firm Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few sectors can claim to have as much sway over the economy as housing. Housing-related employment has accounted for about 23% of the 4.9 million jobs created since the nation's job market began to grow in late 2003, according to Moody's Economy.com. That includes architects, contractors, real-estate agents, brokers and bankers, as well as the host of others who provide the industry with materials and services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's never been a housing boom like this one in terms of the reach, in terms of the range of industries affected," says Ethan Harris, chief U.S. economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. "This is clearly unprecedented."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the boom is coming to an end. Total single-family-home sales were running at an annualized rate of 7.1 million in April, down more than 6% from the June 2005 peak. Backlogs of unsold homes are rising, and price increases are slowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ECONOMISTS EXPECT the slowdown to affect more than just housing-related jobs: As stagnating house prices and higher interest rates limit Americans' ability to use their homes as a source of cash, they are likely to spend less money on consumer goods, meaning less work for all kinds of folks, from assembly-line workers to shop assistants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of weakness in housing-related employment are already appearing. Last week, KB Home, of Los Angeles, one of the nation's largest home builders, said it had laid off about 7% of its 6,600 workers. Earlier, ACC Capital Holdings Corp., the parent of mortgage lender Ameriquest Mortgage Co., announced plans to lay off 3,800 workers. And Washington Mutual said it would be cutting 2,500 jobs related to its home-loan business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's no question that the downturn in the mortgage business has caused a lot of banks to cut jobs," says John Challenger, chief executive of Chicago outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp;Christmas Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a macroeconomic perspective, the housing slowdown, and the attendant slowing of job growth, could be just what the economy needs. If, as some economists predict, the monthly average rate of growth in U.S. non-farm payrolls falls and stays a bit below 130,000 -- from about 175,000 in the first quarter -- that would help keep wages in check, relieving the inflationary pressures that have worried Federal Reserve officials and, as a result, spooked financial markets. "That's exactly what the Fed would like to see," says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No single sector of the economy has the potential to make up for all the jobs likely to be lost in a housing slowdown. Still, some can provide a cushion. All across the economy, companies are running up against the limits of what they can get out of their current workers -- a situation economists say will drive more hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As long as the economy is expanding, you have to add inputs from somewhere, and labor is the easiest input to add," says David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INDUSTRIES THAT have picked up the pace of hiring in recent months include health care, finance (excluding housing-related finance), education and nonresidential construction. Manufacturing, too, is benefiting from increased capital investment in the U.S. and abroad: The sector has added 134,000 production jobs since September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all of the new jobs will be a good fit for people forced out of housing-related work. Immigrants who specialize in low-skill tasks could be among the hardest hit. "The low-skilled or unskilled worker is going to be displaced," says Global Insight's Mr. Bethune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some skills are transferable. Carpenters and electricians, for example, can find jobs on commercial and public projects like office buildings and schools. People who can find ways to improve companies' productivity -- say, by making loan applications easier to fill out -- are always in demand, says Andrew Wilkinson, a managing director in Los Angeles for KForce Professional Staffing. He recently found jobs for a number of business analysts laid off by Ameriquest. Their new employer: Kaiser Permanente, the U.S.'s largest health plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those are the types of folks that our customers generally struggle to find anywhere," he says. "We put them into health care, we put them into biotech and we put them into other financial-services companies." </p>

</div><div class="author">By Christopher Conkey and Michael Corkery </div><div>493 words</div><div>21 June 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home builders stepped up the pace of new construction in May after three months of declines, a sign that the housing market is softening but not collapsing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said housing starts rose 5% last month from April to an annual rate of 1.96 million units, but were down 3.8% from a year earlier. Building permits, an indicator of future trends in new residential construction, fell 2.1% last month and were running 8.5% lower than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The faster pace of new-home building in May is confirmation that the housing market is experiencing what Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke recently described as an "orderly and moderate" correction following last year's peak. That bodes well for the economy, though analysts anticipate more weakness in the housing market during the rest of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing starts surprised to the upside, but May's rebound is almost certainly a temporary pause in the downward trend," said Haseeb Ahmed, U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co. Other economists were puzzled about why builders would keep ramping up the supply of new homes when demand is on the wane. Daniel Oppenheim, an analyst at Bank of America Securities, said the gap between starts and sales traffic was at the "highest level in at least the past 20 years," a development that would lead to "even higher inventory and more pricing pressure."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are proliferating signs that builders are responding to widespread expectations that the housing boom is ending. Robert Toll, chief executive of Toll Brothers Inc., the luxury-home builder based in Horsham, Pa., said the industry also faces an increasingly negative psychology among prospective buyers, despite historically low interest rates and a relatively strong economy. He attributes some of that negativity to media reports about the housing slowdown. "If you go to a party and tell people that you bought a new house, people look at you like you are crazy," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll Brothers last month reported that orders for new homes fell 32% in the latest quarter. On Monday, KB Home, the big Los Angeles builder, said it had laid off some 7% of its workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, starts of single-family homes rose 2.1% from April, but were 7.6% lower than a year earlier, with the declines particularly pronounced in the Midwest. The South is the only region where the rate of new-home construction is up from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One bright spot for builders has been the construction of apartment buildings. Housing starts for residential structures with five or more units leapt 25.4% in May and were nearly 15% higher than a year earlier. </p>

Housing starts for residential structures with five or more units leapt 25.4% in May and were nearly 15% higher than a year ago.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Most U.S. Treasury prices fell moderately at midafternoon, as the market came under some pressure from U.S. housing data released earlier in the session.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of the 10-year note fell 1/32 point to 99 26/32, to yield 5.15%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 5% in May, compared with expectations for a 1.7% rise, with multifamily units helping to fuel the overall increase with its 25.4% jump. The upbeat housing figures comes at a time when most other measures of housing activity in the U.S. have been trending lower, reflecting a broader moderation in the pace of economic data.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While we do not dispute the notion that the sector has slowed noticeably following its torrid performances in the last few years, we have been pointing out for some time that starts were likely to slow more gradually than many anticipated," said Stephen Stanley, chief economist for RBS Greenwich Capital. "Although large homebuilders' quarterly reports indicated drops in net new orders and a rise in cancellation rates, they also indicated bloated backlogs, which are likely to keep builders occupied until at least the end of the year."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News suggesting that the economy may be stronger than expected makes Treasurys less attractive to some investors, although the price action yesterday was small enough as to be inconsequential.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Add it all up and it confirms the fact that housing isn't falling off a cliff and the economy isn't falling apart," said Ray Remy, head of fixed income at Daiwa Securities America. "That's really what it's telling you, so it's put the market under a slight bit of pressure."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With no major data due in coming days and Federal Reserve speakers expected to stay silent on monetary policy ahead of next week's policy meeting, volumes were low, traders said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Housing starts in the U.S. last month increased for the first time since January, suggesting the American housing sector is moderating in an orderly fashion despite rising interest rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Although we believe the housing market has clearly peaked, we expect a moderation in activity rather than a sharp decline, and we view this report as supporting this thesis," Bear Stearns U.S. Economics said in a research note.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May housing starts rose 5% to a seasonally adjusted 1,957,000 annual rate, the U.S. Commerce Department said. Housing starts in April dropped 5.5% to a 1,863,000 rate, which was revised up from an original estimate of a 7.4% decline.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May building permits, seen as an indicator of future activity, fell slightly. Housing starts were down 3.8% from May 2005 levels. Building permits fell 8.5% from a year earlier.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- U.S. Treasury prices fell, propping up yields, after a widespread view that the U.S. housing market is slowing was dented by an unexpectedly brisk rise in monthly housing starts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At midday yesterday, the benchmark 10-year note was off 10/32 point at 99 22/32, to yield 5.164%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of economic strength drain the fixed-income market of safe-haven interest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 5% in May, compared with expectations for a 1.7% rise, with multifamily units helping to fuel the overall increase with its 25.4% jump. The April housing-starts decline was revised upward to 5.5% from the originally reported 7.4% drop.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. government report on housing starts also showed permits for future building dropped 2.1% in May to a 1,932,000 annual rate, slightly more than expected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Add it all up and it confirms the fact that housing isn't falling off a cliff and the economy isn't falling apart," said Ray Remy, head of fixed income at Daiwa Securities America. "That's really what it's telling you, so it's put the market under a slight bit of pressure."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the details of the housing data don't dispel the idea that the housing market is cooling, said economists at Nomura Securities in New York. "Building permits -- a better gauge of future construction activity -- reveal a more consistent and steady downward trend that foretells further declines in homebuilding in the second half of this year," they said in a note yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data yesterday reinforced the idea that growth isn't slowing sharply. The Johnson Redbook retail-sales index rose 1.9% in the first three weeks of June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With no major data due in coming days and Federal Reserve speakers expected to stay silent on monetary policy ahead of next week's policy meeting, volumes were low, traders said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Today's Market Forecast]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foundation Crack</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's some troubling news from the home front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the housing market cools, KB Home, the giant Los Angeles builder, says it has laid off some 7% of its workers. KB had been expecting the housing market to grow another 20% to 30% through next year, says CEO Bruce Karatz. When that didn't materialize, it started letting go of workers in places like Nevada and Arizona.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With each passing day, it seems, a key piece of the economy's foundation gets a little more wobbly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing boom provided important fuel for the job market the past few years. The real-estate sector has been associated with roughly 20% of the four million payroll jobs created in the U.S. economy in the past two years, according to Moody's Economy.com, a research firm. That includes positions ranging from residential-construction jobs and real-estate agents to title insurers and workers at Home Depot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that source of growth disappears, it might not cripple the economy, but it will probably be felt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the Commerce Department gives a broader read on how much pain the home builders are facing. Economists expect the Commerce Department to report that builders started new projects at an annual rate of 1.88 million units in May. That would be up after starts tumbled to a 1.85 million-unit rate in April, but down 8% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's unlikely the home-building industry is going to be the savior of job growth, at least over the next six months," says Mr. Karatz. Lenders like Ameriquest and Washington Mutual also have announced layoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KB Home is in better shape than many other builders. Its second-quarter net income rose 14%, though it said orders are dropping. According to the National Association of Home Builders index, optimism in the industry is at its lowest level in more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall job market still looks pretty healthy. Jobless claims filed by workers, for instance, last week dropped to less than 300,000, generally a mark of a robust labor market. But if the economy is going to keep producing jobs, it looks increasingly like it will need some fresh new legs to stand on.</p>

</div><div>256 words</div><div>20 June 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer U.S. households were late on their home-mortgage payments during the first quarter of 2006 than in the fourth quarter, but some modest increases in delinquencies and foreclosures rates could be ahead, the Mortgage Bankers Association said yesterday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delinquency rate for residential mortgages was 4.41% in the January-March period, down from 4.70% in the previous three months, the MBA said in a quarterly survey. Home mortgages in foreclosure made up 0.98% of the total at the end of the first quarter, down from 0.99% in the previous quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing markets were "normalizing" during the first quarter, with both home sales and price appreciation slowing, MBA Chief Economist Doug Duncan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong economic and jobs growth helped to keep delinquencies down, but the mortgage lenders' association expects continued upward pressure from the aging of the mortgage portfolio, rising short-term interest rates and higher energy prices, Mr. Duncan said, noting the Federal Reserve may have to raise short-term rates more to keep inflation contained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In any event, additional modest increases in delinquency and foreclosure rates are likely in the quarters ahead," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first-quarter data included damage from Hurricane Katrina, which boosted delinquency rates in Louisiana and Mississippi. Excluding the hurricane damage, the national statistics would have shown a lower delinquency rate of 4.31% in the January-March period, down from 4.55% in the fourth quarter of 2005. </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[America's love affair with sprawling homes is showing signs of waning as the real-estate market softens and aging boomers seek smaller houses. June Fletcher on nervous sellers and the growing supply of `faux chateaux.']</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MICKEY AND JANE FINN put their five-bedroom, 6,200-square-foot home in Leesburg, Va., on the market in April, but already they've cut the price to $899,900 from $1.1 million. Now, they've decided to put it up for auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's the hurry? Down the street in their leafy subdivision, two similar-sized houses are also on the market, and around the corner, five more have for-sale signs. The Finns, who paid $692,000 for the new house in 2002, recently retired and, with their two children grown, they're eager to move to a place half the size. "We don't need this big a house anymore -- if we ever did," says Mr. Finn, age 63.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The golden age of McMansions may be coming to an end. These oversized homes -- characterized by sprawling layouts on small lots, and built in cookie-cutter style by big developers -- fueled much of the housing boom. But thanks to rising energy and mortgage costs, shrinking families and a growing number of retirement-age baby boomers set on downsizing, there are signs of an emerging glut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interviews with dozens of real-estate agents, sellers, developers and housing economists turn up signs across the country. In an affluent Dallas ZIP Code, where half the houses have four bedrooms or more, home sales fell 31% in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter. But sales rose 23% in a nearby ZIP Code where 7% of houses have that many bedrooms. In Santa Fe, N.M., homes in the 2,000-square-foot range sell within weeks, while larger ones languish for months, says broker Pat French. In the Boston metro area, sales of homes with four or more bedrooms were flat in the first quarter from a year earlier; sales of homes with three bedrooms or fewer rose 14%. New Jersey appraiser Jeffrey Otteau says the inventory level statewide for large, $1 million-plus houses stands at 13 months, more than twice the state's overall average of six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no formal definition of what constitutes a McMansion. (Some would say it's any home bigger and showier than your own.) One broadly accepted definition, used for this article, is a house larger than 5,000 square feet -- about double the national average -- with four or more bedrooms that is built cheek by jowl with similar houses. Most have been erected since the mid-1980s, when major developers such as Toll Brothers and K. Hovnanian Homes began to chase couples who wanted more space -- and luxury -- than they had when they were kids. These houses often boast grand, two-story entryways, three-car garages, double-height family rooms and master-bedroom "suites" equipped with sitting areas and whirlpool tubs. Developers market the homes under names such as the Grand Michelangelo, Hemingway and Hibiscus -- while detractors have dubbed them "garage mahals," "faux chateaux" or "tract castles."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2003 American Housing Survey, the latest available, found nearly 3.2 million homes in this country with 4,000 square feet of space or more -- the largest category the group tracks -- up 11% since the previous survey in 2001. Part of the big-house mania was fueled by speculation as home prices surged, says housing economist and consultant Thomas Lawler in Vienna, Va. "Folks bought megasized houses well beyond their needs to increase their investment in real estate," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, some boomers in their late 50s are counting on selling their huge houses to help fund retirement. Yet a number of factors are weighing down demand. With the rise in home heating and cooling costs, McMansions are increasingly expensive to maintain. Nationwide, electricity rates have risen 12% over the past three years, while the price of natural gas for heating has risen 43% in the same period, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That means it can cost $5,000 a year or more to heat and cool a 5,000-square-foot house in a city such as Farmington, Conn., according to Connecticut Light &amp;Power Co.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall slump in the housing market also is crimping big-home sales. The volume of newly built homes sold fell 11.2% in the first four months of the year from a year ago, while sales of existing houses fell 5.7%, says the National Association of Home Builders and the National Association of Realtors. Yesterday, one of the biggest home builders, KB Home, cut its earnings outlook for the year, citing declining demand. Bruce Karatz, chairman and chief executive, said demand has fallen "largely due to a sharp reduction of speculative purchases and an oversupply in new and resale inventory."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, the jump in interest rates has put the cost of a big house out of more people's reach. With 30-year mortgages at 6.2% yesterday[JUNE 15], a $700,000 loan costs about $4,300 a month[JUNE 15], up from $3,900 when rates were 5.28% in June 2003, according to Bankrate.com. "The young people coming up don't have the means to absorb these big houses," says Mr. Otteau, the New Jersey appraiser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since February, Kris and Ray Victory have been trying to sell their five-bedroom house in Brookville, N.Y., built in 1987 with a sunken living room and a fireplace in the master-suite wing. The couple raised three children in the 8,000-square-foot home, but they say younger families seem turned off by its $1,000-a-month utility bills and $25,000 annual taxes. "Buyers tell us it's too big," says Mrs. Victory, a 45-year-old electrical engineer. The couple recently shaved $200,000 off the $2.35 million price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This dynamic could become more acute in coming years. As the nation's 78 million baby boomers, born from 1946 through 1964, become empty-nesters and hit retirement age, many are already selling their trophy homes and trading down to smaller models. There are roughly the same number of people in the next pool of potential buyers, but they're marrying later and often have smaller families: U.S. Census statistics show that the average household size in 2005 was 2.57 people -- down from 3.14 in 1970.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, the McMansion oversupply is acute in places like Loudoun County, Va. In the fast-growing area northwest of Washington, D.C., thousands of hulking, red-brick colonials sprouted over the past 10 years on quarter-acre lots that had been carved from farmland and woods. In May, 4,719 houses were for sale, more than three times the year-earlier level. The number of sales dropped 39% to 484 in the month, and the number of days a home remained on the market lengthened to 70 from 14. "Sellers are dying out there," says local real-estate broker Michele Stash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one Loudoun subdivision, Tom Green, a 47-year-old airline pilot, put his five-bedroom house on the market six months ago for $1 million so he and his wife could downsize to a $592,000 townhouse nearby. But his home had to compete with 38 others for sale in the neighborhood with four or more bedrooms. His 5,600-square-foot, five-bedroom house, which he bought new for $515,000 in 2000, didn't get a nibble for months. Finally, a relocating California family agreed to buy it if the Greens would leave behind their high-definition TV and a lifesize Spiderman statue that had been a gift from Mr. Green's sister -- plus slash the price to $820,000. (They also had to throw in a cookie jar with "Biscuit" -- coincidentally, the name of the buyers' dog -- written on the side).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Greens complied. The buyers, John Zuccaro and Cindy Fonseca, say they were emboldened to make their demands when they saw how much the market had cooled since April 2005, when they sold their three-bedroom house in Torrance, Calif., for its full asking price of $759,000 in only five days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though huge houses continue to be built across the country, many architects and builders appear to be responding to shrinking demand for McMansions. In the latest quarterly survey by the American Institute of Architects, 68% of the 500 residential architects polled said home sizes are stable or declining, compared with 58% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For anti-McMansion activists, who hate to see big homes supplant smaller "teardowns" in established neighborhoods, a decline in demand may be good news. Homeowners in some areas have successfully lobbied for laws designed to rein in the light-and-view-blocking monsters: Last year, Arlington County, Va., limited home footprints to no more than 30% of a lot, while Wood-Ridge, N.J., recently said homes could take up no more than 55% of a lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faced with dwindling demand and a fall in their stock prices, many national builders are starting to focus more on smaller houses, which often feature separate dining and family rooms but just two bedrooms. K. Hovnanian Homes, long known for McMansions, is building such houses under its "Four Seasons" label in nine states. Toll Brothers is creating communities like Cranbury Brook Villas in Plainsboro, N.J., which has two-bedroom homes ranging from 1,656 to 1,958 square feet that can be equipped with lofts, sunrooms and dining-room accent columns (the "Bayberry" model starts at $389,975).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet some families have found it hard to downsize. In Phoenix, David and Mary Mumme, both 49, are selling their 4,938-square-foot house, partly because their oldest son is heading to college and partly because maintaining the house and yard -- with pool and waterfall -- takes about eight hours a week. They're asking $1.8 million, about three times what they paid for it six years ago, because they saw nearby houses sell quickly for about $2 million last year. But even though the house has 12-foot ceilings, marble countertops and skylights in the closets, no one has made an offer during the month it's been on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John and Barbara Fiore, both 54, had to slice $50,000 off their $900,000 price to move their 5,500-square-foot house in Warwick, N.Y. Ms. Fiore, who has five grown children, says she worried that no one would want her six-bedroom home while it sat on the market all last year, because today's families are smaller. (The eventual buyer was a married doctor with three young children.) The delay in selling "was scary," says Mrs. Fiore. The Fiores, who built the house 14 years ago, now live in a three-bedroom house nearby that's less than half the size. Meanwhile, Mrs. Fiore's parents recently sold their Warwick house in a month -- but it's only 2,500 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And even some young couples who have tried the big-house life are getting out of it, trading space for higher-quality construction. Last October, Andrew and Sheri Leppert of Alpharetta, Ga., both 32, exchanged their four-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath home for a smaller one that has only three bedrooms and two baths -- yet, at $450,000, cost 50% more. Ms. Leppert, a homemaker who now has a young child, says she was attracted by the new house's details -- including beaded-glass windows, wide-plank flooring and 9-foot-tall doors made of solid wood -- which elevated it in her mind above the "Georgia sprawl" house she was leaving. She and her husband never used the fourth bedroom of their old house, she says, and she doesn't miss cleaning the extra space. "Taking care of it became a burden," she says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>1210 words</div><div>14 June 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COLLEGE STATION, Texas -- When economists in Cleveland and Boston recently ran the numbers, they concluded that houses in this college town were a huge bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysis by National City Corp., a Cleveland banking concern, and Global Insight Inc., a Boston consulting firm, ranked the adjacent towns of Bryan and College Station -- home of Texas A&amp;M University -- as the most "undervalued" housing market in the country in this year's first quarter. So, as the real-estate market cools along the East and West Coasts, are savvy investors racing here to buy every house in sight?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent afternoon, there was little sign of a stampede.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Janet Higgins, a veteran real-estate broker here, drives a visitor past a four-bedroom home custom-built seven years ago, with marble floors and a "gourmet" kitchen. It is on sale for about $420,000, down from $440,000 last year. "It's a wonderful house," Mrs. Higgins sighs. "It's got all the whistles and bells." But she says it is tough competing with new homes on the edge of town. A few hundred feet away, she points to another mini-mansion: "This house they almost gave away."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even by Texas standards, builders here respond quickly to any upturn in demand and give buyers plenty of choices. Mrs. Higgins and other local housing experts do think home prices in Bryan-College Station are likely to rise in the next few years. But they don't expect the kind of buying frenzies that engulfed California in the first half of this decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over enchiladas at a new Mexican restaurant, Marty Cangelose, a home appraiser and chairman of the Bryan-College Station Chamber of Commerce, predicts the housing market will keep "trudging right along" with house-price increases of 3% to 4% a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, forecasting home prices is as risky as predicting how many touchdowns this town's beloved Aggies will score this fall. A visit to this metropolitan area of about 190,000 people shows the dangers of relying too heavily on economic models to determine where house prices are headed in any given town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quarterly analysis of house prices by Global Insight and National City looks at the ratios of home prices to household income in 317 metro areas and seeks to explain the variations in those ratios on the basis of population density (an indication of how much land is available), income levels and past differences in prices that are caused by such things as climate and schools. Economists then estimate what home prices should be and compare those estimates with market prices to determine whether homes are overvalued or undervalued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest study found Bryan-College Station was 24% undervalued. Dallas was the runner-up, at 19% undervalued. Indeed, eight of the 10 bargain-basement cities were in the Lone Star State. The most overvalued cities were Naples, Fla., and Salinas, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study always gets headlines and fuels cocktail chatter. But Michael Carliner, an economist at the National Association of Home Builders, says the historical data crunched in this study may not have much to do with where prices are currently headed. The local price outlook, he says, depends on such hard-to-predict things as how the local economy will perform, population trends and the pace of home building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard J. DeKaser, chief economist at National City, who devised the home-valuation model, says that even the best economic models are "gross oversimplifications of reality." Even so, he says the model provides a general sense of where houses are bargains and where they are overpriced. "I think this is about as good as [such models] get," Mr. DeKaser says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing the model doesn't measure is that Bryan-College Station has lots of homes on the market. In April the number of homes available for sale was enough to last 6.8 months at the current sales rate, compared with a national average of six months and Texas's statewide average of five months. Elsewhere in Texas, inventories have declined over the past year, but they have held steady at six to seven months here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, says about six months of inventory denotes a market roughly balanced between supply and demand. When inventories are above that level, buyers are more likely to drive a hard bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders here seem to have been optimistic about future demand. Mark Dotzour, chief economist at Texas A&amp;M's real-estate center, says that in the first five years of the 1990s, one new home-building permit was issued for every 7.5 new people here. In the first half of this decade, the rate soared to one building permit for every 1.3 new people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larry Mariott, president of Mariott Homes Inc., which builds in this area, believes that there are more builders here per capita than in most other places and that they are willing to work for lower margins than construction firms accept elsewhere. Maybe it is because of the pleasant lifestyle here and optimism about growth prospects, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the local builders are tiny. But one of the nation's largest builders, D.R. Horton Inc., recently began churning out homes here, and that suggests supply will remain plentiful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic models also can't precisely measure differences in land availability and regulation; Texas regulates land use less strictly than many other states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other factors may also help to explain why home prices have stayed low here. No interstate passes through the area, and the nearest major airport is about 90 miles away in Houston, reducing its appeal to high-flying businesspeople. And more than 50,000 university and junior-college students live here, accounting for more than a quarter of the population. Their generally modest needs ensure that a big share of the local housing stock is low-end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some bullish signs for real-estate investors. Moody's Economy.com, a research firm in West Chester, Pa., projects that Bryan-College Station will rank among the top fifth of metropolitan areas in terms of employment growth in the five years ending in 2010. Texas A&amp;M, one of the largest universities in the country, provides a steady source of employment and some high-tech spinoffs. And local Realtors believe that lots of wealthy A&amp;M alumni eventually will retire here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors from California have been buying houses here, especially since Bryan-College Station first hit the top of the "undervalued" chart early this year. Partly as a result, home prices "will be higher," says Chris Tesch, a RE/Max agent here. "I can about guarantee it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Californians even snap up houses sight unseen. "We've sold properties through FedEx and the fax machine," says Eric Walley, a sales manager at Stylecraft Builders Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mrs. Higgins, the veteran agent, urges outside investors not to get carried away. Those expecting mammoth price gains "aren't thinking it through," she says. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median valuation for venture-backed, start-up companies in the U.S. soared 20% to $18.4 million in the first quarter, the highest quarterly level since the fourth quarter of 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median valuations -- the amount investors think the companies are worth -- increased from $15.3 million in last year's first quarter, according to a study from VentureOne, which is owned by Dow Jones &amp;Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal. Company valuations averaged $23 million at the end of 2000 before dropping off during the dot-com bust. VentureOne measured company values before new investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures are another sign of increased venture-capital activity in Silicon Valley and other U.S. technology hot spots. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Christopher Conkey </div><div>681 words</div><div>2 June 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Readings on home prices and manufacturing activity offered fresh evidence that the economy is cooling after a blazing start to the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose 2.0% in the first quarter, the slowest such pace in two years, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. As with other data suggesting a moderate slowdown in the housing market, the Ofheo report shows that the rate of appreciation has gradually declined since peaking last year. Still, the rate of growth in house-price appreciation has retreated only from extraordinary highs, and in the first quarter prices were 12.5% more than a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second report showed that the manufacturing sector experienced slower growth. The Institute for Supply Management, a purchasing managers' trade group, said its index of manufacturing activity fell to 54.4 in May from 57.3 in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower readings on new orders, production and employment contributed to the decline, which left the index at its lowest point in nearly a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Together, the figures point to an economy shifting into a slower period of expansion after a robust first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The rate of growth is slowing a little bit but we have to realize that we're coming from a first quarter when growth was very strong," said Norbert Ore, who oversees the ISM index and also serves as Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s procurement director. "At the end of the day, business spending is staying quite strong and the consumer is the wild card."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because consumer purchases drive most economic growth, one of the major concerns among economists has been that the softening housing market and high gas prices will cause consumers to curtail their spending. Yesterday's Ofheo report alleviated some concerns on the housing side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These data show average housing prices still growing stronger than some might have expected," said James Lockhart, the office's acting director. If prices keep rising, consumers can continue tapping the equity built up in their houses to fuel other forms of spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ofheo is considered the best authority on house prices because it best tracks the changing value of individual homes over time. Its index incorporates data from refinancings as well as purchase transactions. When refinancing data are removed, the index showed purchase prices up 10% in the first quarter compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other measures have shown even less appreciation, and economists at UBS Securities LLC noted that the Ofheo index doesn't include condo and co-op prices, which have experienced some of the sharpest pullbacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless of the measure used, however, a consistent theme of gradual cooling in the housing market emerges. "Increasing sales inventories are apparently giving buyers greater bargaining power, while increasing interest rates are dampening demand," said Patrick Lawler, chief economist at Ofheo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other signs of the housing slowdown, the Commerce Department said construction spending dropped 0.1% in April as residential home building fell 1.1%. Separately, the National Association of Realtors said its pending-home-sales index, a measure of future activity in the sector, was at 111.8 in April, down 3.7% from March and 11.7% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM reading of 54.4 in May still points to growth for manufacturers, but several components provided reasons for concern. The new-orders index, a barometer of future production, fell to its lowest point in a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The employment index fell to 52.9 in May from 55.8 in April, raising more concerns about future growth. The index for prices, an indicator of potential inflationary pressures, jumped to 77.0 last month, its highest mark since the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina late last summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data released yesterday offered a more comforting signal on inflation. The Labor Department revised upward to 3.7% its measure of nonfarm business productivity in the first quarter, as output jumped 6.5% and hours worked rose 2.7%. Unit labor costs rose 1.6% during the first quarter. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic data indicated a cooling U.S. economy, with slowing growth in the factory sector and a drop in construction spending underscoring the decelerating housing market. However, disparate data on inflationary pressures offered few clues for monetary-policy direction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing activity fell to 54.4 in May from 57.3 in April and 55.2 in March. Readings above 50 in the ISM report indicate expanding activity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The manufacturing sector grew once again in May, but the rate of growth . . . slowed somewhat during the month," said Norbert Ore, who directs the survey for the ISM. "The slower growth is evidenced by a significant loss of momentum in the last four months" in the new-order index, while "prices, driven by raw-materials costs, are a concern," he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group again reported that inflationary forces were pressuring factory operators. Its prices index hit 77 in May, up from 71.5 in April and the highest level since last fall.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, government data showed overall construction spending fell in April, marking the first monthly decline since June 2005 and bringing spending totals slightly below expectations. Spending fell 0.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.196 trillion, the Commerce Department said. Spending in March increased 0.9%, an unrevised figure.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, U.S. productivity rose at a faster pace than previously estimated in the first quarter and labor costs eased, suggesting that greater efficiency of U.S. firms and workers is keeping a lid on inflationary pressures. The Labor Department said nonfarm business-sector productivity increased by an annualized 3.7% after falling 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2005. The government had estimated first-quarter productivity growth at 3.2%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unit labor costs rose at an annual rate of 1.6% in the quarter, compared with a previous estimate of 2.5%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upward revision to productivity and downward revisions to labor costs could bolster the argument for Federal Reserve policy makers to pause in their nearly two-year-long tightening cycle.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM also reported that its production index moved down to 57.2, compared with April's 60.4, while the new-orders index came in at 53.7, down from 57.6. The ISM's inventories index hit 48.0 in May. That index was 51.3 in April. The group's employment index stood at 52.9, representing slower hiring gains relative to April's 55.8.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, government data showed overall construction spending fell in April, marking the first monthly decline since June 2005 and bringing spending totals slightly below expectations. Spending fell 0.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.196 trillion, the Commerce Department said. Spending in March increased 0.9%, an unrevised figure. Wall Street had expected April construction spending would be flat.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">April residential construction spending fell by 1.1% to $664.56 billion. Private residential construction, which accounts for the vast majority of residential building, had its largest decrease since January 2004. Residential spending rose 1.0% in March, revised lower than the previously reported 1.6% gain.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unit labor costs rose at an annual rate of 1.6% in the first quarter, compared with a previous estimate of 2.5%.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In minutes of the May 10 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which were released Wednesday, officials said "further productivity gains, which had remained fairly strong on balance in recent quarters may keep any acceleration in wages from seeping into higher prices. Still, officials expressed heightened concern over inflation trends, so some further signs of slower economic activity may be needed to keep officials from boosting official rates further despite the latest evidence of fast productivity growth.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is official: The U.S. was one of the world's fastest-growing advanced economies in the first quarter of 2006. Downbeat data on home sales, however, support economists' expectations that the distinction won't last.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Commerce Department Thursday revised to 5.3% its estimate of first-quarter growth in real gross domestic product -- a measure of the nation's output, adjusted for inflation -- from an initial estimate of 4.8%. The upward revision was smaller than expected, but still made the U.S. the second-fastest-growing economy among advanced members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that have reported first-quarter data. Greece is in first place, with an annualized growth rate of 8.2%, according to the OECD.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists see the big first-quarter number more as a one-time payback for an unusually slow fourth quarter -- which took the hit for Hurricane Katrina -- than an indication of how fast the U.S. economy will grow this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a hot quarter, but it was a bit of a fluke and overstated the underlying strength of the U.S.," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at consultancy Global Insight. Combined, the two quarters yielded average annualized growth of 3.5%, about the rate at which the U.S. economy has tended to expand in the long term.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first-quarter spurt contributed to another strong quarter for U.S. business. After-tax corporate profits rose 8.8% in the first quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.115 trillion. That was less than the 13.8% rise in the fourth quarter. But profits in the latest period were up 24.8% from a year earlier, the largest year-on-year increase since 2002. At 8.9%, after-tax corporate profits' share of the entire economy reached the highest level in at least 60 years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New data on home sales, however, supported economists' predictions that the economy is likely cooling. The National Association of Realtors reported Thursday that sales of existing, or previously owned, homes fell 2% in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.76 million units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing has been a major pillar of the economy in recent years as low mortgage rates fueled a home-buying boom that created lots of new jobs in everything from construction to mortgage finance. As home values rose, consumers were able to tap the equity in their homes to finance spending. A cooling housing market is seen damping consumer spending.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first-quarter spurt contributed to another strong quarter for business. After-tax corporate profits rose 8.8% in the first quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.115 trillion. That was less than the 13.8% rise in the fourth quarter. But profits in the latest period were up 24.8% from a year earlier, the largest year-on-year increase since 2002. At 8.9%, after-tax corporate profits' share of the entire economy reached the highest level in at least 60 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New data on home sales, however, supported economists' predictions that the economy is likely cooling. The National Association of Realtors reported yesterday that sales of existing, or previously owned, homes fell 2% in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.76 million units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing has been a major pillar of the economy in recent years as low mortgage rates fueled a home-buying boom that created lots of new jobs in everything from construction to mortgage finance. As home values rose, consumers were able to tap the equity in their homes to finance spending. A cooling housing market is expected to damp consumers' desire to spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most home prices still are rising, but a growing backlog of unsold properties is putting more pressure on prices to fall. The median single-family home price in April was $222,700, up 4.3% from a year earlier, while the median price of condominiums and cooperatives was $222,000, down 0.2% from a year ago. At April's rate of sales, it would take six months to sell all the homes on the market, up from 5.6 months in March. The inventory of single-family homes, at 5.9 months, was up 40.5% from a year earlier -- the largest year-on-year rise since 1982, when the Realtors' association began collecting the data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What's interesting is the unbelievable speed with which people are dumping houses on the market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at consultancy High Frequency Economics. "I don't think the market can absorb this much supply this quickly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The factors that led to the bump up in GDP also point to slower growth ahead. A smaller-than-expected trade deficit reflected some strength in U.S. exports, but was driven mostly by a drop in oil imports that economists expect will reverse in coming months. Businesses produced more to rebuild inventories depleted by robust first-quarter sales, but that means they won't need to restock as much in the current quarter or later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The upward revisions leave a little less growth on the table for the remainder of 2006," said Steve Wieting, senior economist at Citigroup in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, a report on jobless claims suggested companies might be slowing their hiring. The Labor Department reported that 329,000 people filed for unemployment benefits in the week ended May 20. The seasonally adjusted number was down 40,000 from the previous week, but higher than economists had expected. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's official: The U.S. was one of the world's fastest-growing advanced economies in the first quarter of 2006. Downbeat data on home sales, however, supported economists' expectations that the distinction won't last.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Commerce Department Thursday revised to 5.3% its estimate of annualized first-quarter growth in real gross domestic product -- a measure of the nation's output, adjusted for inflation -- from an initial estimate of 4.8%. The upward revision was smaller than expected but still made the U.S. the second-fastest-growing economy among advanced members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that have reported first-quarter data. Greece is in first place, with an annualized growth rate of 8.2%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists see the big first-quarter number more as a one-time payback for an unusually slow fourth quarter, which took the hit for Hurricane Katrina, than an indication of how fast the U.S. economy will grow this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a hot quarter, but it was a bit of a fluke and overstated the underlying strength of the U.S.," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at consultancy Global Insight. Taken together, the two quarters' growth average out to 3.5%, about the rate at which the U.S. economy has tended to expand in the long term.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first-quarter spurt contributed to another strong quarter for U.S. businesses. After-tax corporate profits rose 8.8% in the first quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.115 trillion. That was less than the 13.8% rise in the fourth quarter. But when compared with the first quarter a year ago, profits in the latest period were up 24.8%, the largest year-on-year increase since 2002. At 8.9%, after-tax corporate profits' share of the entire economy reached its highest level in at least 60 years.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing has been a major pillar of the economy in recent years as low mortgage rates fueled a home-buying boom that created lots of new jobs in industries from construction to mortgage finance. And as home values rose, consumers were able to tap the equity in their homes to finance lavish spending. But a cooling housing market is expected to damp the consumer's desire to spend.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Realtors' report, the backlog of unsold homes kept rising. At April's rate of sales, it would take six months to sell all the homes on the market, up from 5.6 months in March. The inventory of single-family homes, at 5.9 months, was up 40.5% from a year earlier, the largest year-on-year rise recorded since 1982, when the group began collecting the data.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest readings on U.S. housing and business investment confounded economists' expectations, but the underlying trends still show the economy acting pretty much as Federal Reserve officials had hoped: Perhaps slowing, but not sinking.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In two separate reports, the Commerce Department said new-home sales rose and businesses' orders for capital goods dropped in April. At first glance, that's at odds with the Fed's main scenario for what the economy will do this year: Consumer spending should slow as a weakening housing market makes people feel poorer, but increased business investment -- in the form of capital-goods purchases and hiring -- should help keep the deceleration from becoming a disaster.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists, however, warned against reading too much into the volatile monthly data, saying that longer-term trends still point toward slowing home sales and growing capital spending. "We all agree that the housing market is cooling off, and some other sector of the economy must take the burden of keeping growth healthy," said Ethan Harris, chief U.S. economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. "Capital spending is a prime candidate."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.19 million in April, up 4.9% from the previous month, thanks in part to a surge in southern states. The number contrasted sharply with expectations of an April drop in home sales, but downward revisions to previous months' numbers lessened the surprise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a sharp drop in aircraft business helped U.S. total orders for durable goods, defined as anything intended to last three years or more, fall a larger-than-expected 4.8% to a seasonally adjusted $210 billion in April, after rising an upwardly revised 6.6% in March. One measure of business investment -- "core" orders for capital goods such as computers, oil rigs and railroad cars, excluding defense and aircraft -- also dropped a larger-than-expected 1.7% in April, compared to a revised 3.6% increase the previous month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists saw April's drop in capital-goods orders largely as payback for the large jump in March. Overall, capital spending remains on an upward trend: In this year's first four months, core capital-goods orders were up 9.7% on year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we smooth out the vagaries of month-to-month flows, what emerges is a pattern that is wholly consistent with the Fed's belief of how the economy is going to unfold this year," said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities in New York.  </p>

"Capital spending is a prime candidate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.19 million in April, up 4.9% from the previous month, thanks in part to a surge in Southern states. The number contrasted sharply with expectations of an April drop in home sales, but downward revisions to the previous months' numbers lessened the surprise. After revisions, the rate of new-home sales dropped 7.6% over the first three months of 2006, compared with a previous estimate of 4.2%. April's rate of sales was still 12.4% below the most recent peak in July 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The overall picture is one of a cooling housing market," said Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at MFR Inc. a New York consultancy. "It's hard to argue against that." Declining demand, for example, was among the reasons cited by luxury-home builder Toll Brothers Inc. when it announced earlier this week that it was lowering its full-year earnings forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a sharp drop in aircraft business helped U.S. total orders for durable goods, defined as anything intended to last three years or more, fall a larger-than-expected 4.8% to a seasonally adjusted $210 billion in April, after rising an upwardly revised 6.6% in March. One measure of business investment -- "core" orders for capital goods such as computers, oil rigs and railroad cars, excluding defense and aircraft -- also dropped a larger-than-expected 1.7% in April, compared with a revised 3.6% increase the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists saw April's drop in capital-goods orders largely as payback for the large jump in March. Overall, capital spending remains on an upward trend: In this year's first four months, core capital-goods orders were up 9.7% over the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we smooth out the vagaries of month-to-month flows, what emerges is a pattern that is wholly consistent with the Fed's belief of how the economy is going to unfold this year," said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increasing demand for U.S. capital goods might illustrate a second-order effect of globalization, say some economists. The rise of export-oriented producers in China and elsewhere created a flood of cheap consumer goods into the U.S., increasing competition for the U.S. businesses and holding prices down. Now, though, as those same foreign producers invest to boost capacity, they're also boosting demand -- and prices -- for the kind of capital goods that the U.S. makes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're seeing very strong demand for capital goods in Asian markets," both from Western firms building local facilities and from local firms looking to compete with the foreigners, said Edward Campbell, chief executive officer of Nordson Corp., Westlake, Ohio, which makes equipment that applies paint and other coatings to everything from cereal boxes to washing machines. He said his company's Asian orders were up 48% in the most recent quarter from a year earlier. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite growing indications of a cooling housing market in the U.S., one niche continues to sell briskly -- multimillion-dollar homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Francisco, 18 homes costing $3 million or more sold in the first quarter, up from 15 in the same period last year, according to real-estate-information service DataQuick. In Jackson, Wyoming, that number rose to 21 homes from 17, according to Jackson Hole Real Estate &amp; Appraisal. Higher up the scale, 10 homes at $5 million or more in Palm Beach, Florida, sold in the first quarter, up from eight last year, says the county assessor's office.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One factor in the growth could be that median prices of all homes have risen, pushing more homes into the luxury end. Also, inventory is up across the board. And it is true that not all markets are seeing a surge in high-end sales. In New York's borough of Manhattan, 212 homes priced above $4 million sold in the first quarter, from 226 in the year-earlier period, according to Brown Harris Stevens.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at a time when the overall number of home sales has declined in many U.S. cities, the number in the ultrahigh range has continued to grow.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory Heym, chief economist for New York real-estate brokerages Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property, says there may be less of a connection between the highest segment and the rest of the housing market. The stock market has created new wealth and the number of millionaires has grown, so more buyers are paying in cash. That has left luxury buyers mostly insulated from economic factors such as rising short-term interest rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Zandi, chief economist at forecasting firm Moody's Economy.com, says the segment of high-end buyers "won't be immune from the unfolding travails of the rest of the market, but it will weather those difficulties much better than it has historically."  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DESPITE GROWING indications of a cooling housing market, one niche continues to sell briskly -- multimillion-dollar homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past few months in the overall U.S. real-estate market, more homes have crowded the market and sales volumes have fallen in areas from Houston to Boston and Washington, D.C. Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored provider of mortgage-loan funding, predicts total home sales this year will be down by about 7% from 2005's record levels. Yet one area of the market appears immune to all that: In many locations, homes on the ultrahigh end of the price scale -- those costing $3 million and up -- have been selling in increasing numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Francisco, 18 homes in that range sold in the first quarter, up from 15 in the same period last year, according to real-estate information service DataQuick. In Jackson, Wyo., that number rose to 21 homes from 17, according to Jackson Hole Real Estate and Appraisal. Higher up the scale, 10 homes at $5 million or more in Palm Beach, Fla., sold in the first quarter, up from eight last year, says the county assessor's office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One factor in the growth could be that median prices of all homes have risen, pushing more homes into the luxury end. Also, inventory is up across the board. But at a time when the overall number of home sales has declined in many markets, the number in the ultra-high range has continued to grow. One possible message: Just as it is often said that the rich aren't like the rest of us, the real-estate market of the rich appears to bear a decreasing resemblance to the one experienced by most Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes at $3 million and up represent less than 2% of the overall market, estimates the National Association of Realtors. Activity at this small upper end has traditionally been a leading indicator for the broader market, says Gregory Heym, chief economist for the New York real-estate brokerages Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property. Now, he says, there may be less of a connection between the two segments. The stock market has created new wealth and the number of millionaires has grown, so more buyers are paying in cash. (The National Association of Realtors found that 8% of home buyers paid in cash last year, up from 6% in 2003.) That has left luxury buyers mostly insulated from economic factors such as rising short-term interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Zandi, chief economist at forecasting firm Moody's Economy.com, says the segment of high-end buyers "won't be immune from the unfolding travails of the rest of the market, but it will weather those difficulties much better than it has historically."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walter Molony, a spokesman for the National Association of Realtors, says the highly volatile high-end market serves as a poor market indicator. Activity among first-time home-buyers, he says, is more telling. "That segment provides liquidity for people to be able to trade up to larger homes," he says. "Without strong entry-level activity, the market would sink."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Todd Michael Glaser listed his 11-bedroom Miami home in February, overall sales volume in the city was slipping -- sales fell 21% for the month over a year earlier. But he wasn't concerned. He listed it for $40 million, well above Miami-Dade County's record single-family home sale of $27.5 million in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Glaser, a 41-year-old real-estate investor, figured the property would sell based on its amenities and location. The 20,000-square-foot home is one of the biggest on North Bay Road, where neighbors include Billy Joel and Matt Damon. A month after hitting the market, it went under contract for purchase. Brokers with knowledge of the deal put the price at over $30 million, though Mr. Glaser wouldn't reveal the number. "It's not a property for the everyday home buyer," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Angeles County, 217 homes priced over $3 million sold during the first quarter, up from 114 during the same period last year, according to Cecelia Kennelly-Waeschle of Sotheby's International Realty. That is the biggest first-quarter jump since the firm started tracking sales in 1988. For the same period, the number of all sales in the county fell 10.3%, according to DataQuick. Two homes priced above $10 million sold in Santa Barbara, Calif., during the first quarter -- including a $28.5 million, 17-acre oceanfront property to actor Kevin Costner -- up from one a year earlier. (The data in this and other markets do not show how long the homes spent on the market or whether they sold at their original asking price.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some affluent buyers don't limit themselves to what's on the market. When Henry Kravis, managing partner of New York-based Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, went shopping for a Palm Beach house in January, he didn't like any of the available properties. His broker, Lawrence Moens, identified a property that wasn't for sale, but fit Mr. Kravis's criteria: a 15,255-square-foot home on five acres along Lake Worth. "I just knocked on the door and said, `I've got a buyer willing to pay a lot of money for your home,' " says Mr. Moens. A few weeks later, the deal closed for $50 million, public records show. Local brokers say it is the highest price ever paid for a non-oceanfront property there. Mr. Kravis declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all markets are seeing a surge in high-end sales. In Manhattan, 212 homes priced above $4 million sold in the first quarter, from 226 in the year-earlier period, according to Brown Harris Stevens. Appraisers say that apartments are staying on the market longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even where sales are falling, confidence hasn't always flagged. On the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe, sales of homes priced above $1 million fell 35% in the first quarter over a year earlier, according to Chase International Realty. That didn't stop Tom Gonzales from raising the price on his home in Incline Village, Nev. After staying on the market for a year at $60 million, he raised the price on the 4.5-acre property to $65 million last month, to account for the upkeep he's paid. "I don't think there's a shortage of people looking for a property like this," says Mr. Gonzales, 61, who co-founded software company Commerce One in the 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet in Fairfield County, Conn., Lake Forest, Ill., and San Diego County, brokers say many sellers are trimming prices amid a glut of pricey homes. Writer Jane Green and her husband, bank executive David Burke, cut the price of their Westport, Conn., property by $1 million after it sat for eight months at $5 million. Shortly afterwards, the property sold in January for $3.9 million, public records show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk of a slowdown hasn't affected Sean Wolfington, a former Philadelphia Internet entrepreneur, who just outbid two other buyers on a six-bedroom estate in Key Biscayne, Fla., formerly owned by the singer Cher. The cost: $8.8 million, in cash. "Interest rates aren't a factor for me," says Mr. Wolfington, 34, who now runs an independent film company. "Waterfront properties like these are in limited supply. I saw this as an excellent buying opportunity."</p>

  Though sales volume is up for the country's most-expensive homes, it is a 
small market. Here's a look at a broader market in five areas for homes at 
$1 million or more, with the number of sales in the first quarter of 2006 
and the percentage change over the first quarter of 2005. 
  -- Amir Efrati 
 
  LOCATION: Chicago and suburbs 
  SALES/ CHANGE: 373/ 32% 
  COMMENTS: Homes between $1 million and $2 million on the lakefront and in 
the northern suburbs have been selling fast, says broker Honore Frumentino. 
 
  LOCATION: King County, Wash. 
  SALES/ CHANGE: 241/28% 
  COMMENTS: Inventory has fallen and demand is high, particularly for 
waterfront homes on the west side of Bellevue, says broker Wendy Lister. One 
home there just sold above its $7 million asking price, after getting three 
offers.

</div><div class="author">By Mark Whitehouse  </div><div>521 words</div><div>17 May 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>11</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. producers absorbed some of the pain of higher energy prices in April and the housing market showed further signs of cooling, helping to quell fears inflation will spread to the broader U.S. economy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wholesale prices of finished energy goods such as gasoline rose 4% in April, pushing up average prices on all finished goods -- everything from turkeys to tractors -- a greater-than-expected 0.9% in April, the Labor Department reported. But the closely watched "core" index of producer prices, which excludes energy and food, rose only 0.1%, below expectations.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given all the energy-price hikes coming through, that's still very subdued," said Nigel Gault, U.S. economist at consultancy Global Insight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists and investors watch wholesale prices closely as a signal of what may happen with the consumer-price index, a broader measure of inflation on which the government will report today. The two don't correlate closely from month to month, but producer prices do give some indication of what's coming in consumer prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, various U.S. indicators have pointed toward gathering inflation pressures, raising concerns that the Federal Reserve will have to extend its 23-month string of interest-rate increases. Also, the U.S. economy appears to have been running a lot hotter in the first quarter than initially believed. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported last month that real gross domestic product -- the value of the nation's output, adjusted for inflation -- grew at an annual rate of 4.8% in the January-March period. Some expect the government to revise its estimate of first-quarter GDP growth a full percentage point higher.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Longer term, many economists are counting on a cooling housing market to ease the economy into a more moderate, less inflationary rate of growth. The Commerce Department yesterday provided some data supporting that scenario: Housing starts fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.85 million in April, below expectations and down 7.4% from March.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's moving in the right direction," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com. "Unless housing comes off quickly, the broader economy will remain strong, and inflationary pressures and interest rates will continue to rise."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday's reports on wholesale prices and housing had a calming effect on U.S. markets. In early futures trading, the implied probability that the Fed will raise its short-term interest-rate target to 5.25% from the current 5% at its next policy meeting, in June, fell to 36% from 42%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 5.13% from 5.16%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. producers kept prices of finished goods largely in check despite larger increases in input prices, suggesting they are finding ways to absorb higher costs. The average price of core crude materials -- the most basic inputs such as wheat and timber -- rose 4.7% in April, while the average price of core intermediate materials such as processed yarns and ball bearings were up 0.4%.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- The dollar fell against major rivals after U.S. government reports for April showed core wholesale inflation remained tame while housing starts dropped for a third-straight month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At midmorning, the dollar was at 110.08 yen, off from 110.35 yen late Monday in New York. The euro was at $1.2851, up from $1.2784. The pound was at $1.8853, up from $1.8773. The dollar was at 1.2076 Swiss francs, down from 1.2124 francs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., "the sharper-than-expected weakness in housing signals fresh weakness is ahead for the dollar," said Brian Dolan, head of currency research at Gain Capital. The data suggest "the slowing in the housing market that the [Federal Reserve] has anticipated is materializing," he added.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 7.4% in April to a seasonally adjusted 1.85 million annualized units, the U.S. Commerce Department reported. Led by higher energy costs, producer prices rose 0.9% in April, but prices outside of energy were well contained, the Labor Department said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro felt some pressure after a poll of German sentiment fell sharply. The report raised concern that the European economic recovery isn't as strong as some in the market had expected.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Today's Market Forecast]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Desperate House-builders</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Usually, strong housing reports are good news for the economy. Sometimes, a little weakness is in order.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's report on housing starts from the Commerce Department might be a case in point. Under normal circumstances, a strong number would be cheered as a sign that the housing market is holding up. But aggressive construction now would hint at recklessness among the nation's home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires and CNBC estimate that construction began on 1.95 million homes last month, at an annual rate, not far off the March pace of 1.96 million. The government's measure of housing starts surged in January -- thanks to mild weather and to statistical adjustments used to factor in seasonal building patterns -- and then fell sharply in February and March, as cold weather rolled in and the housing market continued to slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing looks as if it's getting slower still. On Friday, the University of Michigan's twice-monthly survey of consumer sentiment showed that, as of mid-May, Americans believed this was the worst time to buy a home since 1990, which was the beginning of the last major housing slowdown. Yesterday, the National Association of Home Builders' Housing Market Index, which is based on home builders' assessment of the market, slipped to its lowest level since 1995. And in recent months, several large public home builders have said their orders for new homes are slipping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the market cooling and the home builders themselves feeling pessimistic, a dip in housing starts is probably in order. It would suggest that builders are drawing down excess inventory. Home builders haven't always acted so rationally in the past. In the early 1990s, many small home builders put up houses before they found actual buyers, and were rewarded by going out of business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hope is that home builders will be on better behavior this time. Large public builders now drive the market, and they say they're careful about managing inventories. Moreover, a dearth of available land and regulatory constraints may have damped speculative building during the boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's numbers will give a clue about whether that's true. But, as MFR economist Josh Shapiro says, you won't really know "until demand evaporates and you see who's naked and who's not."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael Corkery </div><div>607 words</div><div>16 May 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices were higher in many U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2006, but the pace of growth is cooling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its latest report of home prices in 149 metropolitan areas, the National Association of Realtors said the median price of a single-family home in the U.S. was $217,900 in the first quarter, up 10.3% when compared with the same quarter a year ago. That's a smaller increase than in the fourth quarter, when the median price of a home was up about 13.6% year-over-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, NAR's chief economist, said in a statement that home prices are rising less rapidly because the inventory of homes available for sale is rising. "With the supply of homes picking up very nicely in many areas of the country, pressure is coming off of home prices." Mr. Lereah also indicated that the trend is continuing into the current quarter, and that he expects price-appreciation will be "returning to normal rates of price growth in the single-digit range."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several Florida metropolitan areas remained near the top of the list of cities with the strongest price appreciation in the first quarter, including Orlando, Tampa and Daytona Beach. And while price gains still posted double-digits in those cities, they were not as sizzling as in the fourth quarter. Price appreciation in the Cape Coral/Fort Myers areas, for example, was up 18.3% year-over-year in the first quarter compared with 48% in the fourth-quarter. In the Miami-Fort Lauderdale market, prices increased 11% year-over-year in the first quarter, compared with 24% in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Phoenix area had the highest home-price appreciation in the first quarter, rising 38.4% to $268,300, compared with a year earlier. But that was down from a jump of 49% in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weakest housing markets tended to be in the Midwest, especially cities in Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. But some coastal cities also had price declines, including the Boston area where the median price was $390,400, down 1.5% compared with a year earlier. While that price drop was relatively small, "if it continues for the next few quarters, it would be a worrisome sign that demand is just not matching up with the supply," said Lawrence Yun, another NAR economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists attributed price drops in parts of the Midwest to a sluggish economy. Richard DeKaser, the chief economist at Cleveland-based National City Corp., said the price slowdown in Boston "simply could be an affordability question -- prices outstripping people's ability to afford a home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordability also could help to explain why prices are starting to pick up in some smaller low-cost cities that missed much of the housing boom of recent years. Prices in Elmira, N.Y. -- in western upstate New York -- were up 18.8% to a median of $88,500. The NAR said that was the largest price increase of any city in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. home builders turned negative on the housing market for the first time since just after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo said yesterday. The NAHB/Wells Fargo housing market index, which gauges builders' sentiment, fell six points in May from a revised 51 to 45, the lowest level since June 1995, according to the industry group. </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market is showing more signs of a slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said yesterday that its index of pending sales of existing homes fell 6% in March compared with the same month last year. Meantime, another large home builder reported an expected drop in contracts for new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index of pending home sales is based on contracts for existing homes that were signed in March. The index declined 1.2% from February. "This squares with our overall perception of the ongoing, but moderate, settling of the market," said Dave Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, said in a statement that "the pending-sales data is showing a dampening effect from rising mortgage interest rates."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week the Commerce Department said new-home sales in March were up nearly 14% from February, but inventories of new homes on the market rose to 555,000 in March, up 24% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ivy Zelman, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said some large home builders could be experiencing a more acute slowdown in sales because much of their business is concentrated in the once-hottest markets that are now cooling the fastest, such as California, Florida, Washington, D.C., and Arizona.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest home-sales report comes after Hovnanian Enterprises Inc., based in Red Bank, N.J., said Monday it expects a 20% decline in net contracts of new homes in its second quarter, partly because of increases in cancellation rates. The company lowered its fiscal 2006 guidance to $7.20 to $7.40 a share, from its earlier estimate of $8.05 to $8.40 a share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, Toll Brothers Inc., the Horsham, Pa., luxury home builder, is expected to report its revenue, backlog and contracts for its second quarter. Analysts will be watching the report closely. "Each data point we get we are using to try to read the tea leaves," says Ms. Zelman.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. continued showing signs of economic growth in April and March, as manufacturing picked up steam, beating expectations, while builders boosted construction spending to a record and consumers opened their wallets even wider.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, a private research group, said its index of manufacturing activity hit 57.3 in April, rising from 55.2 in March and 56.7 in February. Readings above 50 point to expansion in activity and describe the breadth of change.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expected the index to come in at 54.8.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The manufacturing sector grew at a faster rate during April, as production and employment showed significant strength," said Ralph Kauffman, who directs the ISM manufacturing survey. "While many members indicate that business is good, they still have major concerns about the impact of higher prices for energy and industrial commodities."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, total construction spending rose 0.9% in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.199 trillion, the U.S. Commerce Department said. February spending was revised to 1% from the previously reported 0.8% rise. Wall Street had expected that construction spending increased 0.4% in March.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential-construction spending advanced 1.6% in March to $680 billion, after a 1.3% rise in February. Nonresidential-construction spending was flat in March. Outlays for lodging, public safety and communication rose, but spending on roads declined.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. personal income also increased in March, at a rate double what was expected. Spending also rose. Personal income increased at a seasonally adjusted rate of 0.8%, after rising an unrevised 0.3% rise in February, the Commerce Department said. March personal consumption rose 0.6%, after a revised 0.2% increase the month before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median forecast of 14 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and CNBC was for a 0.4% rise in personal income and in spending.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Savings as a percentage of aftertax income rose to negative 0.3% in March, compared with negative 0.6% in February.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">World-wide chip sales rose 7.3% to $59.1 billion in the first quarter from a year ago, fueled by demand for cellphone chips, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">March sales of semiconductors also rose 7.3%, increasing from a year earlier to $19.7 billion, and they moved up 2.3% from February sales of $19.26 billion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The San Jose, California, chip industry's trade group said cellphone sales in the first quarter increased 31% from the year-earlier quarter, helped by a substantially shorter replacement cycle and robust demand in China. Unit sales are now expected to reach one billion this year, with cellphones representing the second-largest market, after personal computers, for semiconductors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">March chip sales in the Asian-Pacific region climbed 13% to $8.94 billion from the year-earlier month and rose 1.7% from February.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first significant piece of economic data for April reinforced the widening view that the U.S. economy entered the second quarter with a good deal of momentum. But a whiff of inflation fueled concern that the Federal Reserve will be forced to step harder on the brakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, a purchasing managers' trade group, said yesterday that its index of manufacturing activity came in at 57.3 for April, higher than expected and up from 55.2 in March. Any level above 50 suggests that the manufacturing sector is growing. A reading in the mid-50s is strong for an economy already in its fifth year of expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's an impressive number," said Peter Kretzmer, senior economist at Bank of America in New York. "With businesses feeling good and starting to hire, that adds to personal income and is likely to keep consumer spending going, even if other elements are slowing it down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A drop in the new-orders component of the ISM index, however, suggests that April's number might be more an echo of a strong first quarter than a sign of things to come. "We'll have to see how well that translates into future growth," said Norbert Ore, who oversees the index and serves as procurement director at Georgia-Pacific Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, two reports from the Commerce Department showed U.S. consumers going strong in March. Personal consumption rose 0.6%, and a jump in home improvements helped boost construction spending by 0.9%. Both numbers were higher than economists' expectations for the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said that after adjusting for inflation, personal spending was on a trajectory to rise at an annualized rate of about 3% in the second quarter, compared with 5.5% in the first quarter. That is consistent with expectations that the economy's rate of growth will slow in the current quarter, as higher gasoline prices and a cooling housing market make consumers feel poorer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal income rose 0.8% in March, double the rate economists expected. A $40 billion annualized jump in payments under Medicare prescription-drug benefits accounted for most of the increase, but wages and salaries also rose at a healthy 0.4% rate, indicating that consumers are benefiting from a stronger job market. People kept spending beyond their immediate means: Expenditures exceeded disposable income by $32.5 billion, or 0.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department also reported a larger-than-expected increase in its index of consumer-goods prices -- a number that Fed officials watch closely for signs of inflationary pressures. The "core" index, which excludes food and fuel, rose 0.3% in March and 2% for the 12 months ending in March, at the top of the 1% to 2% range that the Fed considers acceptable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inflation number led more investors to bet that the Fed will take its short-term interest-rate target a notch higher, to 5.25%, at its June policy-making meeting, after an expected increase to 5% from 4.75% at its May 10 meeting. In early afternoon trading, the futures market put the probability of a June increase at about one-in-three, compared with odds of about one-in-four last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In statements to Congress last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke suggested that the Fed might take a break in June from two years of consistent rate increases, but the new inflation data will "make the case for a pause at the June meeting a little difficult," said John Ryding, chief U.S. economist at Bear Stearns in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, U.S. manufacturers' good fortunes hadn't translated much into jobs and gains in household income, as companies found ways to produce more with the same workers and equipment. But recent robust jobs data suggest that they are getting to the point where they need to boost capacity to keep growing -- a factor that could mitigate any slowdown in consumer spending. In March, companies added 211,000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls. The government will release April jobs data Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We try to do lean manufacturing, but there's a point where you're bumping up against capacity and you're going to need to add more people," said Tony Raimondo Jr., president of Behlen Country, a division of Behlen Mfg. Co., of Columbus, Neb. He said Behlen Country, which makes ranch equipment such as horse stalls and dog kennels, is already hiring at one plant in Oregon. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Christopher Conkey and Greg Ip </div><div>1261 words</div><div>27 April 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest readings suggest the nation's economy is carrying significant momentum into the second quarter, raising new questions about when a slowdown might come after a torrid start to the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By most accounts, the economy surged in the first quarter after a brief lull late last year. When the government releases its first estimate tomorrow, economists expect it to say the economy grew at a roughly 5% annual rate in the quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But over the rest of the year, Federal Reserve officials expect growth to moderate to a long-term rate of 3% to 3.5%, slow enough to keep inflation at bay but fast enough to keep unemployment from rising. That would permit the Fed to stop the campaign of interest-rate increases it began in June 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, however, the economy has been sending signals that it might not be ready to settle down. The housing market, though softer, is holding up better than many skeptics predicted and consumer confidence remains surprisingly strong, despite soaring gasoline prices, and concerns about President Bush's handling of the economy. Meanwhile, solid job creation and wage gains are providing a cushion for consumer spending, and orders for capital equipment are picking up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday, the Commerce Department said new-home sales jumped 13.8% in March from a month earlier, erasing much of the 15.8% decline seen over the two previous months. It also reported that orders for durable goods -- items such as tractors and washing machines that are meant to last three years or more -- rose 6.1% last month on the back of strong aircraft orders at Boeing Co. More important, orders for capital goods, excluding aircraft and defense, usually a good indicator of future business spending, broke out of a recent slump last month to post a 3% gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we're seeing now is telling us about the momentum going into the second quarter," said Julia Coronado, senior economist at Barclays Capital. "It seems to be pretty strong."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flow of indicators these days is particularly important because the Fed has said that prospects for further increases in short-term interest rates -- beyond an expected quarter-point increase next month to 5% from 4.75% -- will depend on what new economic data show. At their last meeting in March, Fed officials appeared to think they could pause after rates reached 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the spate of strong data has prompted futures markets to raise the probability of further increases to more than 50%, and the inflation-wary bond market has sold off recently. Yesterday, bond prices fell again, and the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 5.107%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's latest roundup of business conditions, also released yesterday, suggested no slowdown is yet under way. "Economic activity continued to expand in March and the first half of April," the Fed said in its "beige book" report. Only one of the 12 Fed districts -- New York -- said growth slowed. Even so, evidence of broader inflationary pressure remained scant. The Cleveland district said many raw-material prices had risen, but "retail prices remained relatively flat."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke testifies on the economy to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress today, but he isn't expected to give clear signals about what the Fed's next interest-rate move is likely to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, despite the recent robust data, economists say a strong finish to the first quarter is more likely to be a prelude to slower growth in the second. Oil prices and interest rates are rising, and the extent of the housing market's correction is still uncertain. As a result, few analysts are willing to raise their growth forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at New York consulting firm MFR Inc., said he still expects growth to slow to a 3% annual rate in the current quarter. "Could the second quarter be a little stronger than that? Yes, but not way higher," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses are helping to spur the economy. On their way to record corporate profits last year, businesses increased their investment at a 16% annual pace in the fourth quarter, the fastest clip since mid-2004. Ms. Coronado of Barclays expects that spending on equipment and software, a closely watched measure of investment, rose at an 11% annual rate in the first quarter and will grow at a 9% rate in the current quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Google Inc. recently said that its capital spending, which was $838 million in 2005, will grow even faster than its revenue this year. Manufacturing bellwether Caterpillar Inc. recently raised its profit forecast for 2006 to between $4.85 and $5.20 a share, up from $4.04 a share in 2005. Announcing the sunnier outlook, Caterpillar Chief Executive James Owens said "strong underlying fundamentals are in place, and we believe this is a business cycle that has staying power."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In yesterday's Fed report, business investment appeared to be strong. "Production capacity for mining equipment in the Chicago district is reportedly booked through 2007," the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With prospects on the business side looking solid, one of the major assumptions built into forecasts for slower growth has been that consumers will cut back on spending. Peter Hooper, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, said, "We really do need to see some slowing in consumer-spending growth in the second quarter to give the Fed room to pause" its rate raising at 5%. He predicted that would happen thanks to the combined impact of higher gasoline prices and slowing home-price appreciation, "although the risks have risen" that the Fed will raise rates beyond 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has yet to show signs of a prolonged slump, but even with March's upturn a slowdown is still apparent. New-home sales in March, while up from February, were 11.5% below their peak last July. Sales of existing homes, which make up 80% of the housing market, are only 4.8% lower than when they topped out last June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, inventories of new homes on the market rose to 555,000 in March, up 24% from a year ago, and the unadjusted median sales price for a new home actually fell 2% from a year earlier, suggesting builders have used discounts to get homes sold. Existing-home prices have declined slightly so far this year, giving consumers less home equity to finance other purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another sign of weakness in the housing market, Dallas-based home builder Centex Corp. yesterday said orders fell 11% in the fiscal quarter ended March 31. CEO Timothy Eller said cancellations were up, too. The company slashed its earnings outlook for fiscal 2007 to a range of $8.50 to $10 a share, down from an earlier estimate of $10.75 to $11.25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the strong labor market, which has lowered the unemployment rate to 4.7% and shows few signs of reversing course, is likely to reassure consumers. Yesterday's Fed report found that job markets were still tightening, and wage pressures were rising. The Dallas district cited "reports of difficultly finding workers who meet basic qualifications of employment, such as background checks and drug tests."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One New York-district employment agency said "salaries are up at least 15% from a year ago for experienced office workers," and a Boston district firm said there was a "war for talent." </p>

</div><div class="author">By Christopher Conkey </div><div>533 words</div><div>26 April 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In two surprising signs of the economy's resilience, sales of existing homes rose slightly in March and consumer confidence strengthened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two reports painted positive pictures of the economy at a time when rising gasoline prices threaten to curtail other consumer spending. Investors concluded that the Federal Reserve is now more likely to prolong its campaign of interest-rate increases in an effort to moderate economic growth. "Housing is the most interest-sensitive sector of the economy," wrote Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. "If this area remains firm, policy makers most likely will conclude that financial conditions are not sufficiently restrictive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales edged up 0.3% in March after jumping 5% in February, according to the National Association of Realtors. The gains in the past two months followed a gradual decline in the previous five months, and indicate the housing market isn't experiencing the severe downturn some have feared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Conference Board announced that its consumer-confidence index for April rose to its highest level in four years. The 109.6 reading this month was up from 107.5 in March. The survey continues to show consumers are more optimistic about the current economic situation than they are about future conditions. "Recent improvements in the labor market have been a major driver behind the rise in confidence," said Lynn Franco, director of the survey. But she also warned that rising gas prices "could dampen consumers' mood."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets anticipate the Fed will raise short-term interest rates next month to 5% from 4.75%, but they are divided over whether it will pause thereafter. In futures-market trading yesterday, the likelihood that the Fed will opt for another quarter-point increase in June rose close to 50% from around 40% on Monday. The inflation-wary bond market moved in the same direction, pushing prices down and driving the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note up to 5.081%, a four-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite concerns that the economy isn't cooling enough to satisfy the Fed, there were plenty of reasons for caution in yesterday's housing report. The inventory of unsold homes rose 7% in March to the equivalent of a 5.5-month supply. That's the highest level of homes on the market in nearly eight years, according to the NAR. The supply of condominiums on the market rose 15% to 6.9 months in March, the largest inventory of unsold condos in more than six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price -- half of homes sold for more and half for less -- was unchanged in March at $218,000, down from a peak of $229,000 last June, but 7.4% higher than a year ago. Existing-home sales, which constitute 80% of the housing market, ran at an annual rate of 6.92 million units last month, down 0.7% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the Commerce Department will release data on new-home sales in March. </p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>1262 words</div><div>26 April 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS HOME SALES cool on the East and West coasts, some cities that missed out on the real-estate boom are becoming the strongest markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A look at inventories of unsold homes, prices and employment trends points to generally positive signs in Houston, Dallas and Atlanta -- cities that have seen only modest home-price gains in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metropolitan areas whose housing markets look less healthy, at least in the short term, include Boston, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco. All of them have growing inventories of homes and relatively weak job growth. As a result, houses that a year or two ago might have sold in hours now are languishing on the market for months, and some sellers are cutting prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To produce a snapshot of residential real-estate prospects for 18 major metro areas, The Wall Street Journal examined inventories of homes for sale at the end of the first quarter from a variety of local sources; pricing trends based on surveys of real-estate agents by Daniel Oppenheim, an analyst at Banc of America Securities in New York; and projections of job creation by Moody's Economy.com, a research firm in West Chester, Pa. Inventory data provide a broad picture of the overall supply of housing, while job trends are the biggest driver of demand. The pricing data show how markets are adjusting to recent shifts in supply and demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas has been a laggard in recent years, partly because job markets were weak in some cities and land for new houses is plentiful. Now, the state's job market is strong, as cities there are benefiting from the oil boom and an influx of people from abroad and elsewhere in the U.S., and housing demand is keeping up with the relentless spread of new subdivisions as Texas cities sprawl. Investors, many from California, are adding to the demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas home prices could rise 6% to 9% annually over the next several years, up from an average of 4.5% over the past 15 years, says James P. Gaines, an economist at Texas A&amp;M University's Real Estate Center in College Station. He says the state is attracting residents and employers because its housing remains very affordable by national standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't see a slowdown coming," says Lorraine Abercrombie, chairwoman of the Houston Association of Realtors and director of marketing for Greenwood King Properties. Last week, Greenwood listed a five-bedroom home in Houston's Wilchester West neighborhood. Within three days of the first showing, the home was under contract for $465,000, well above the asking price of $449,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta also benefits from a healthy job market, due partly to the city's role as a regional hub and a magnet for immigrants and conventions. J. Lewis Glenn, president of Harry Norman Realtors, says the total value of homes sold by the big local firm in March was up more than 10% from a year earlier. Unlike Dallas and Houston, though, Atlanta's inventory also is up substantially -- 15% -- from a year earlier, according to SmartNumbers LLC, a local research firm. That bulge should restrain price increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the nation as a whole, many real-estate executives and economists continue to predict a fairly soft landing for the housing market. Among those taking this view are Ronald J. Peltier, chief executive of HomeServices of America, a chain of real-estate brokerage firms owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. But Mr. Peltier warns that prices in parts of Southern California could fall as much as 5% to 10% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One coastal market that remains strong is Seattle, where jobs are plentiful and home inventories remain lean, though they have crept up from a year earlier. But many other coastal markets are suffering hangovers from the boom of recent years. Rising interest rates have priced some buyers out of these expensive markets and deterred speculators, who no longer can count on fast profits and are dumping properties on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the weakest markets is Boston, where inventories have nearly doubled from a year ago and the job market is soft. The median price of homes listed for sale in the Boston area has fallen 3.3% from a year earlier to $579,000, according to MLS Property Information Network Inc. in Shrewsbury, Mass. For condos, the median asking price is down 6% to $375,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sonia Hernandez Diaz, an assistant professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, has had her two-bedroom condo in Brookline, near Boston, on the market for only a month, but already has lowered the price to $449,000 from $469,000. She says there have been lots of people looking at the condo, featuring "gleaming" hardwood floors and an eat-in kitchen, but no offers yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Jersey, a market highly dependent on people who commute to other states, prices are likely to be flat to slightly higher this year, down from the double-digit pace of recent years, says Jeffrey G. Otteau, president of Otteau Appraisal Group in East Brunswick, N.J. Next year, he thinks prices could fall 5% or so in the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think that we're going to be in a flat holding pattern for the next several years," Mr. Otteau says, though at the top end of the market, there is "an extreme oversupply" of houses. In Spring Lake, N.J., known for expensive homes, there is a three-year supply of homes at the current rate of sales, and Upper Saddle River has a 21-month supply, Mr. Otteau estimates. He blames the state's loss of high-paying jobs in such industries as telecommunications and pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The picture is mixed in Phoenix, Las Vegas, San Diego and Washington, D.C. Inventories have surged in all four cities, particularly in Phoenix, as sales have slowed. But job growth is well above the national norm, and that should soften the landing. The Las Vegas market has "normalized," says Linda Rheinberger, president of the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors. Prices there are likely to rise 5% to 10% this year after jumping about 49% in 2004 and 14% in 2005, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Miami, a building boom has more than tripled the inventory in the past year. Even so, population growth should absorb any excess supply within 12 to 18 months, says Ronald A. Shuffield, president of Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell Realtors, a big real-estate brokerage firm there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Detroit area, which missed the boom, is now being mauled by job cuts in the auto industry. "We haven't quite hit the bottom yet," says Dan Elsea, president of brokerage services at Real Estate One, a large brokerage firm in Michigan. For houses in the range of $400,000 to $1 million, he says, prices are down about 10% from a year ago. He calls it a good opportunity for investors.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Christopher Conkey </div><div>513 words</div><div>19 April 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of new house construction slowed last month, and home builders are becoming increasingly pessimistic, signs of further weakening in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, wholesale prices were up in March, but a tame reading on underlying prices suggests inflation is rising at only a moderate clip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said housing starts fell 7.8% in March to an annual rate of 1.96 million units, matching February's 7.8% drop to 2.13 million units. Although the pace of home building in March was 6.9% higher than a year ago, the recent declines indicate that the supply of new houses is starting to follow the downward trajectory of sales seen in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With sales declining, interest rates moving higher and the inventory of unsold homes increasing, economists have been expecting builders to respond by slowing the pace of construction. "I viewed it as inevitable," said Dave Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. "All the indicators about demand have been down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With sale cancellations up, customer traffic down and the need to offer incentives rising, builders are getting discouraged. After peaking at 72 in June, the NAHB/Wells Fargo survey of builder sentiment dropped to 50 this month, a level where the number of builders saying sales conditions are "good" equals the number saying they are "poor." The index "hasn't been this low since the immediate aftermath of 9/11," Mr. Seiders said. "I actually expect it to move down further."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Labor Department said wholesale prices in March rose 0.5% from the previous month and 3.5% from a year earlier. Producer prices fell 1.4% in February. Much of the volatility is caused by gasoline prices, which jumped 9.1% last month, after an 11% drop in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "core" producer price index, which is more closely monitored by economists because it excludes the volatile energy and food sectors, was up only a slight 0.1% from February and 1.7% from a year earlier. After more worrisome readings the two previous months, the tame figure for core prices in March assuaged fears that robust economic growth and rising oil prices will cause inflation to surge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The bottom line is that wholesale price inflation, outside the energy sector, is likely to remain in check, and the outlook for consumer prices remains good," said Peter Morici, a professor at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business. The Labor Department will release March figures for consumer prices today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets cheered the reports as signs that the Federal Reserve may stop its series of short-term interest-rate increases after an expected increase from 4.75% to 5% next month, pushing up stock and bond prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 194.99 points to close at 11268.77, while the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.982%. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- U.S. Treasury prices strengthened yesterday morning as the fixed-income market reacted favorably to news of tamer-than-expected core inflation and a drop in housing starts last month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In morning trading, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was up 5/32 at 96 8/32 to yield 4.99%, down from 5.09% late Monday. Price gains came across the curve, with the two-year note's yield falling to 4.86%, its lowest level in more than 10 days.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Labor Department reported a larger-than-expected 0.5% gain in producer prices last month, mainly because of a rise in oil prices. But the 0.1% increase in core producer inflation, which strips out energy and food prices, was tamer than the 0.2% gain expected by economists surveyed by MarketWatch.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Action Economics said the data won't alter widespread investor expectations that the Federal Reserve will tighten the federal-funds rate by another quarter percentage point to 5% next month. The central bank has implemented 15 consecutive quarter-point increases since 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest sign of a weakening housing market, the Commerce Department said housing starts fell 7.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.96 million units in March, the softest result in a year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A robust housing sector has been one of the key drivers of the economy, and mounting indications that it is slowing should help convince the Fed that the economy doesn't need further cooling in the form of rate increases.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the National Association of Home Builders index for sales of new, single-family homes came in lower than Wall Street expectations and indicated that builders are essentially split evenly in terms of "good" sales expectations and "bad" sales expectations.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- U.S. Treasury prices rallied yesterday, lifted by minutes from the latest Federal Open Market Committee policy meeting showing that most members thought the current program of rate increases is nearing an end.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bonds also drew support from dovish remarks by a U.S. Federal Reserve official and news of tamer-than-expected core inflation and a drop in U.S. housing starts last month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In afternoon trading, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was up 15/32 at 96 15/32 to yield 4.959%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The minutes from the Fed policy meeting of March 27-28 said, "Most members thought that the end of the tightening process was likely to be near and some expressed concerns about the dangers of tightening too much, given the lags in the effects of policy."  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS REAL-ESTATE PRICES surged across most of America, some of the biggest gains swept coastal resorts. Now there are signs the tide has finally turned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Naples, Fla. -- a year ago the fastest-appreciating community in the country -- prices slipped 1% in February, says the Florida Association of Realtors. In Ocean City, N.J., the median price fell 7% in March from a year before, according to an estimate by the Ocean City Board of Realtors. Most other places nationwide have yet to show a fall in median prices, which typically lag a sales slowdown by several months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers in Ocean City, a densely populated barrier island with a long boardwalk and broad beaches, have cut prices as their properties languish. Bill Beible had listed his four-bedroom, two-bath condominium for $1.35 million last spring. Mr. Beible, a manufacturing executive who bought the place in 2003 for $725,000, admits the price was a bit steep, but other homes like his had sold in a matter of days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Beible now says he aimed too high. After getting no takers, he cut the price to $1.25 million. A buyer materialized, but asked for concessions -- and then backed out. When Mr. Beible relisted the condo late last year he dropped the price to $1.195 million, but didn't get any offers. So last week he cut again, to $1.059 million -- down 28% from his initial price. "I wish I had priced it lower from the beginning," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another sign of skittishness in vacation communities: Some real-estate agents have started cutting prices on their own homes. Broker John Melton listed his 10-year-old house in Bend, Ore., for $549,000 in December; now he's lowered the price to $524,000. In Naples, Al Lazzaro cut the price twice on his four-bedroom lakeside house, to $699,000 from $747,000, after getting dozens of email blasts every day from fellow agents shouting, "owner motivated."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, agents who once simply wrote up orders are quietly cutting commissions or fronting money for home repairs, closing costs or even sewer permits. The dearth of buyers means sellers must consider every offer, even if it gives them little profit, says agent Jim Kalweit in the Cape Cod town of Hyannis, Mass. "Offers that would have been an insult a year ago are now being accepted," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown means more houses are piling up on the market. On Cape Cod, the total number of homes for sale has risen 62% since this time last year; in some places in Southwest Florida, home listings are up as much as 75%, say local real estate boards. And in many coastal communities the number of single-family home sales is down dramatically from last year. Sales have fallen by nearly half in Sarasota, Fla., one-third on Cape Cod and nearly 15% in Newport Coast, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a recent quarterly survey of 299 housing markets found that many of the country's most popular vacation-home communities are also among the most overvalued. The analysis, done jointly by research company Global Insight of Boston and financial holding company National City of Cleveland, looked at home prices, household income, population density and other factors from 1985 to 2005. The survey says markets that are 30% or more out of line with historic figures are extremely overvalued and ripe for price corrections. Among them are Naples, Ocean City, Bend, Santa Barbara, Calif., and Barnstable, Mass., on Cape Cod.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this is a seismic shift from just last year, when some consumers were raiding their home equity to grab a beach or mountain place. Investors and second-home buyers purchased a record 3.34 million homes last year, up 16% over 2004, according to the National Association of Realtors. (Investors made up three out of four of these purchases.) But while boomers in their peak earning years may still buy homes for vacations or eventual retirement, the investor segment is expected to shrink, the trade group says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For renters, a softening vacation-home market could mean more properties to consider and negotiable rates. That's because some owners who had hoped to sell may instead rent out this summer season. "You can certainly play the price game this year," says Bill Rompf, spokesman for RentalHouses.com, a Louisville, Ky., online listing site. But, he adds, don't expect deep discounts in upscale places, where vacationers are more focused on a property's distance to the beach and golf course than on price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, buyers also should benefit. But the fact that some sellers are trimming prices has made some buyers wary. Nancy Rawls, a hospital-benefits coordinator, is looking to buy a two-bedroom vacation condo in Pensacola, Fla., but thinks prices may continue soften through the summer as inventory levels build. "You have to sit, wait and watch," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's a look at five vacation markets where prices show signs of cresting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naples, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SUMMER OUTLOOK: Now that the snowbirds have flown back North, price-cutting could pick up -- especially as hurricane season nears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy of this tony Southwest Florida city relies heavily on real-estate sales, especially to out-of-staters. Realty ads are ubiquitous, inflating the size of the local newspaper; agents even slip listing sheets under the glass tabletops at a popular ice cream shop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in the decade, a three-bedroom condo near the beach went for less than $300,000. Such prices attracted investors, pushing up the market rapidly. That's not a problem for the truly rich, who are still buying properties in the $10-million-plus range (five have sold since January), but it's creating an affordable-housing crisis for many year-round residents, who make a median income of $66,000. The median single-family home price hit $492,000 in February, the highest in the state, says the Florida Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Naples tops the Global Insight/National City list as the country's most overvalued market. Single-family home sales are down by one-third since this time last year. Inventory levels have reached a 21-month supply -- in other words, if no other homes came on the market, it would take that long for all of those currently listed to sell. That's about three times the supply at this time last year, and about four times the current inventory level nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're flooded with inventory," says Tripp Champion, a Naples real-estate agent. He represents a German buyer who's just slashed the price of his four-bedroom mansion three blocks from the beach by 15%, to $3.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For buyers, the market is opening up. Susan and Brian Lewis of Ridgewood, N.J., have been looking for a Naples vacation place in the $500,000 range for two years. But they hadn't liked the selection, which tended to be older places that need updating. "I always felt like I was back in my mom's kitchen," says Ms. Lewis. Now, agents are showing the couple newer and larger places -- though the Lewises plan to wait until summer to buy, since they expect prices to fall further. "We're sitting pretty now," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Santa Barbara, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SUMMER OUTLOOK: Don't expect bargains at the top of the market, but prices and rents for more modest homes are already falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Pacific Ocean views from its hillside homes, Santa Barbara has long attracted celebrity homeowners, from Jane Fonda to Michael Jackson. And its continuing popularity with the rich and famous has helped insulate sales at the upper end. Ninety-three single-family homes sold in March, up 21% from the same month last year, according to the Santa Barbara Multiple Listing Service, and prices at the top of the market continue to rise. Agent Randy Solakian, who deals with some of the region's most-expensive homes, says the big prices some of these homes reached in previous years -- a few topped $40 million -- have created overblown expectations. "Sellers have become intoxicated by all the zeroes," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for most shoppers, Santa Barbara's median price of $1.19 million as of March, one of the highest in the country, is daunting. The lack of more-affordable choices had pushed inventory levels up 9% by that month, and overall sales, including condos, down 3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for properties under $5 million is weakening; agent Nell Eakin says the price of one of her listings was just reduced by $315,000, to $2.5 million. Within walking distance of a country club and surrounded by gardens and fountains, the Spanish-style home has been on the market only a little more than a month. Landlords are discounting, too. Erik Eyman, a computer technician, couldn't snag a tenant for his three-bedroom ocean-view house, which he estimates is worth about $1.7 million, until he lowered the monthly rent to $2,900 from $3,500. He says that over the last few months, both selling prices and rents in Santa Barbara had become "ridiculous, expensive, outrageous -- but they're softening now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bend, Ore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SUMMER OUTLOOK: Prices will sag on the upper end, but not for homes under $300,000, which are scarce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located in the center of the state, Bend doesn't attract beach-goers. Rather, second-home buyers come to enjoy skiing in the Cascade Mountains, which loom over the town, rafting in the river that runs through Bend, playing on one of more than two dozen golf courses or hiking in nearby parks. Relatively low home prices are a draw, too, making Bend the sixth-fastest-growing metropolitan region in the United States, according to U.S. Census estimates released last September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have been rocketing, though, jumping 32% to a median in March of $327,500 from a year earlier. "Prices have come up so dramatically there's a real problem with affordability," says broker Jim Floyd. The number of single-family homes sold last month fell 28% from a year earlier, to 177, according to the Multiple Listing Service of Central Oregon -- possibly an early warning of cooler conditions. Sellers are getting the message. On one street in Bend, a seller dropped his asking price by $40,000, to $1.359 million, after less than two months on the market; down the street, another house has gone to $998,000 from $1.033 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ocean City, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SUMMER OUTLOOK: High inventory levels should soften prices. But rentals are strong, so some owners will try to wait out the slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like much of the Jersey Shore, Ocean City was ignored by New York vacation buyers until the early 2000s, when exploding prices in the Hamptons finally persuaded buyers to take a look. Suddenly, prices soared and supply dried up. "Things went through the roof," says Nicholas Marotta, president of the Ocean City Board of Realtors, adding that "we all knew it was going to come to an end."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both single-family and condominium sales in March fell by two-thirds from a year earlier. Meanwhile, the supply of homes on the market mushroomed. The inventory of single-family homes has more than doubled, while the condo inventory nearly tripled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broker Mark Grimes says many sellers are trying to unload properties they bought only two years ago, when prices were rising rapidly. "Now they're going the other way, and they're thinking `This could get worse,'" he says. Some sellers aren't waiting for that to happen, and are cutting prices drastically -- last week, one of Mr. Grimes's clients dropped his listing 20% to $1.995 million. Others, like respiratory therapist Gabe Dunn, whose three-bedroom furnished condo is on the market for $499,000 -- $110,000 more than he paid last June -- are advertising for summer rentals as a hedge against a softening market. "Sellers have to be flexible," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barnstable, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SUMMER OUTLOOK: Relative bargains will abound for buyers, especially in condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years ago, Cape Cod was hot. But the popular peninsula has been stagnant for more than a year, and things don't seem to be getting any better. In Barnstable, in the mid-Cape, the median single-family home price is nearly unchanged from last year at $360,000. The number of single-family home sales is down almost 7% from last year. Condo prices have fallen 3.8%, to $193,640, according to the Cape Cod &amp;Islands Multiple Listing Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lisa Burgess, a Barnstable agent, says that while sellers are starting to cut prices, so far they've not come down enough to jump-start the market. "Buyers are still sitting on the fence," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slump has had a dampening effect on would-be home flippers. Seventy-eight-year old Barbara Fleming, a retired receptionist, got into the game late, nabbing an 18th century home for $380,000 during the beach-buying rush three years ago. She lived in the home while spending more than $100,000 for improvements, including replacing the roof, replastering the walls, refinishing the floors and refurbishing the kitchen. Last year, she put it on the market for $689,000, hoping to recoup her costs and make enough profit to buy another fixer-upper. She got an offer, but the deal fell through when the market cooled so much that the would-be buyers couldn't sell their own place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Ms. Fleming has reduced her asking price twice -- it's now at $650,000 -- she says she's resigned to the possibility that no one might meet it.</p>

  Here's a look at five vacation-home markets that are overvalued but aren't 
in imminent danger of significant price declines, according to research firm 
Global Insight and financial concern National City. Prices and sales data 
are for March 2006, and change is from a year earlier. 
  MARKET: Berrien County,  Mich. 
  MEDIAN PRICE/% CHANGE: $124,000, up 6% single-family homes only 
  TOTAL SALES/% CHANGE: 187, up 4% single-family homes only 
  COMMENTS: Prices for vacation homes along Lake Michigan showed "slippage" 
in recent months but have started to recover as buyers, many from Chicago, 
feel the economy is strong, says real-estate broker Dan Coffey. 
 
  MARKET: Charleston, S.C. 
  MEDIAN PRICE/% CHANGE: $212,500, up 35% condos only 
  TOTAL SALES/% CHANGE: 157, down 68% condos only 
  COMMENTS: Chris Anderson, a real-estate broker, says first-quarter condo 
sales were strong but numbers are down from last year because fewer projects 
were launched. Condo conversions aren't selling well, he says. 
 
  MARKET: Sandusky, Ohio 
  MEDIAN PRICE/% CHANGE: $89,500, down 4% single-family homes only 
  TOTAL SALES/% CHANGE: 41, up 46% single-family homes only 
  COMMENTS: Overall sales are still robust in this small town on Lake Erie's 
southwestern shore, but median home prices fell slightly since last year. 
 
  MARKET: Santa Fe, N.M. 
  MEDIAN PRICE/% CHANGE: $300,000, down 1% single-family homes only 
  TOTAL SALES/% CHANGE: 92, up 18% single-family homes only 
  COMMENTS: The second-home market is surging, with 33 sales of $1 
million-plus in the first quarter, double the number a year  earlier, says 
broker Fred Raznick. An influx of cheap builder homes may have lowered 
median home prices, he says. 
 

  MARKET: Savannah, Ga. 
  MEDIAN PRICE/% CHANGE: $189,900, up 11% condos only 
  TOTAL SALES/% CHANGE: 34, down 24% condos only 
  COMMENTS: Condo prices are up 11% from last year, besting single-family 
home appreciation during the same period (4%), but total condo sales dropped.

</div><div class="author">By Michael Corkery </div><div>1870 words</div><div>12 April 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami -- TODD LINSLEY, a 37-year-old investor, bought a three-bedroom house in Stuart, Fla., for about $318,000 in late 2005. His original plan was to quickly flip the property -- which is in a new housing development about 40 miles north of West Palm Beach -- by selling it for as high as $425,000. But when he saw that the market was turning, he decided to list the home for $379,900. It's been on the market since early January with no takers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Linsley says home builders keep discounting unsold houses in the neighborhood -- sometimes axing as much as $100,000 off the original asking price. He says he can't afford to go that low. "If I got in a jam I would have to drop the price, but I am not at that point," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So now he's renting his investment house out for $1,000 a month, while paying a $2,045 monthly mortgage and a $108 monthly homeowner's association fee. "My Plan B was always to rent it out. I am not going to lose my shirt," says Mr. Linsley, a salesman for a medical-products company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Linsley is far from the only housing-market investor who has been forced to go to Plan B in recent months. Many cities that experienced fast run-ups in home prices during the past five years are now seeing sales cool the fastest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes that just last year were selling so rapidly that they stayed on the market for just days or even hours -- condominiums on the Florida coastline, desert haciendas in California and Arizona, town houses in Washington, D.C. -- are now languishing without buyers or even prospects. Many once-booming markets are seeing double-digit declines in sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales have been slowing for several months, but real-estate agents in some of these formerly red-hot markets have been surprised at how suddenly market conditions have deteriorated in the past few months. The Florida Association of Realtors reported recently that sales of existing single-family homes were down about 20% in February when compared to the same month a year ago -- and they were off as much as 47% in Naples. In California, sales dropped 15% in February compared with last year, led by a 30% decline in Sacramento, according to the California Association of Realtors. February sales were off year over year by about 19% in Washington, D.C., and down about 25% in and around Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, housing sales are a mixed picture. While nationwide sales of existing homes increased 5.2% from January to February on a seasonably adjusted basis, new-home sales dropped 10.5%. Right now, economists say the housing market will have only a modest negative impact on the overall economy, which has been robust. They note that while sales are slackening, they aren't collapsing -- they are, in many cases, simply settling into a normal market pace. Inventories are rising but they haven't reached an alarming amount. And while demand for homes is easing off in markets that previously sizzled, they are posting gains in cities where prices are still considered bargains, including Indianapolis, Albuquerque, N.M., and Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for cities like Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Phoenix and San Diego, the dropoff in sales and rising supply of homes on the market could soon put downward pressure on prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In some places prices might fall. In others, price gains will slow," says David Berson, chief economist at Fannie Mae, the mortgage-finance company. The price gains over the past five years, which caused home values to double in many of the hottest markets, "were not sustainable," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current slowdown reflects three broad trends, according to real-estate agents and economists. One of the most important is that many speculators have started to dump homes that were purchased as investments. In addition, high prices and rising interest rates have reduced affordability for middle-class families. Finally, the intensity of recent hurricanes has prompted potential buyers of second homes to pull back in places like Florida. Some even blame media coverage that has warned of a possible downturn for triggering a real downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowhere are these trends more vivid than in Florida. There were more building permits issued for single-family and multi-family homes in Florida last year than in any other state, according to the National Association of Home Builders. Five of the 10 metropolitan areas with the strongest one-year price appreciation last year were in Florida, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You could consider Florida to be ground zero for the housing market," says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com, an economic consulting firm in West Chester, Pa. He says the factors that caused the housing market to overheat nationwide -- such as "creative financing" offered to credit-risky buyers -- were exacerbated in Florida. "There were more lenders, more realtors, more foreign investors," than anyplace else, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How investors react will have a big impact on how Florida's correction will unfold. According to San Francisco-based LoanPerformance, which tracks mortgages nationwide, 15% of Florida homes last year were purchased by investors, the most of any state. Investors are also critical, economists say, because in a slowing market they could be quicker to drop their prices to cut their losses than typical homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speculative buying helped drive up prices in many Florida cities and shut out many nonspeculative buyers. Recent upticks in interest rates have put homeownership even further out of reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the slowing in Florida could prove to be temporary. The state remains one of the fastest growing in the nation. It's growing, on average, by 1,000 people a day. Florida's economy is relatively strong and it continues to create new jobs. And while many Florida cities are seeing declines in sales, a smaller group of Florida markets is holding steady. Sales in Jacksonville were essentially unchanged in February year over year, and they were up in Tallahassee. But in many other parts of the state "things have slowed to a crawl," says Mike Morgan, a broker in Stuart, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor that may be affecting sales is the appearance of some investor-dominated housing developments, some of which were built with minimal landscaping next to highways, cemeteries and mobile-home parks. Several of the housing developments snapped up by investors now look like ghost towns, with "For Sale" or "For Rent" signs in many windows. In some cases, the builders "were building for investors, not for homeowners," says Mr. Morgan, who is trying to resell several investor-owned homes with mixed success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a year ago, when the market was stronger, Mr. Morgan sold homes to several out-of-state investors, who never saw the property in person. "It's really no different from the dot-com [bust]," Mr. Morgan says. "The people who bought the [low-quality homes] got clobbered." He says he refused to sell poor-quality homes to his clients. "If I didn't have any ethics, I could have made a million dollars last year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The swelling supply of condominiums is also causing concern. In Miami-Dade County alone, there are roughly 70,000 new condos either under construction or nearing construction, and an additional 25,000 units that have been announced but don't have final approval, says Michael Cannon, managing director at Integra Realty Resources-south Florida, which analyzes the local market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We believe that the condo market is more distressed," says Hank Fishkind, principal at Orlando-based Fishkind &amp;Associates, an economic and financial consultant. "We are seeing a mismatch in timing. The projects started two years ago -- the delivery is accelerating, while closings are slowing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to that supply are the rental apartments that have been converted into condominiums. Mr. Cannon says roughly 150,000 rental apartments in South Florida have been converted or have begun to be converted to condos in recent years. Typically, the condo converter buys the rental unit, renovates it and then sells it to an individual, often an investor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Zani, an investor, is trying to resell two converted units he purchased in Orlando. He bought one condo unit in November for $137,000 and had it listed for $185,000; he bought the other for $147,000 and it was listed for $195,000. But he's been unable to resell either one. "We will probably come down on the price," says Mr. Zani, who lives in Nashville, Tenn. Some pockets of the condo market may fare better than others. Mr. Cannon says parts of Miami's downtown business district and the area north of downtown, which aren't directly on the ocean, "have the signs of being overbuilt. The jury is still out. We have to wait until they are completed," he says. Meantime, John Warsing, a broker of high-end Miami-area condos at Turnberry International Realty in Aventura, Fla., says "anything oceanfront is going to be fine," in part because well-heeled consumers from across the world are attracted to buying oceanfront property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other problems are rattling Florida's market. Home-insurance costs are rising, after the active hurricane season of the past few years. And real-estate agents say some homeowners are spooked by the storms themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of people have that view of New Orleans in their minds and they are getting nervous. They are putting houses on the market," says Melissa Watkins, a sales agent with Michael Saunders &amp;Co., near Sarasota. "They are not living here full time and [their home] is an investment. They want to pull their money out and hold on it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Watkins says sales are slow, inventory is rising and listing prices are being reduced slightly. She says one recent deal almost fell through at the last minute when the buyer balked at the insurance premiums on a high-end, waterfront home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Floridians blame the media and even Wall Street for scaring people away. Mr. Linsley recalled a headline in a local paper declaring that the local housing market was overvalued. The headline type was so bold that it looked as if the nation had just declared war. "The media is killing the investors," Mr. Linsley says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the current turmoil, some Floridians remain bullish, including Stuart Miller, the chief executive officer of Miami-based Lennar, one of the largest home builders in the U.S. But Mr. Morgan, the broker, says for him the market has slowed considerably. He wrote in an email late last week that "we went three days this week with not a single showing. That's incredible. I have 35 listings. We usually get 2-6 showings a day. . . . I received more desperate calls from sellers than ever. One lady broke down into tears. Her husband bought two investment properties, and they are now going to lose their `life savings' if they sell the homes in today's market." </p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>419 words</div><div>6 April 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors predicted that purchases of investment homes will decline this year after surging in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey of home buyers by the trade group found that 28% of all homes purchased in 2005 were for investment rather than for occupancy by the buyers, up from 25% in 2004 -- figures that are far higher than those shown by mortgage-lending data. Such homes are generally bought to serve as rental properties, at least in the short term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in mortgage interest rates in the past year will discourage some investors, says David Lereah, chief economist for the NAR. "There are fewer incentives to speculate in the market with price appreciation cooling in much of the country."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Lereah and many other housing economists expect the housing market to settle into a "soft landing" after the frenzied demand of recent years. Some housing experts warn, however, that prices could fall at least modestly in some cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loan data compiled by LoanPerformance, a unit of First American Corp., show a steady rise in investor demand for houses but at a much lower level than that reported by the NAR. LoanPerformance found that 9.5% of home-purchase mortgages in 2005 were for investors, up from 8.6% in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LoanPerformance derives its data from loan-service companies accounting for about 80% of the mortgage market, according to Bob Visini, vice president of marketing. The NAR bases its findings on a survey of 3,406 people who bought homes in 2004 and 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One source of variation between the two reports is that LoanPerformance doesn't capture data on homes purchased without a loan. Paul C. Bishop, an NAR economist, says another factor is that some investors may not identify themselves as such to lenders because they want to avoid the higher interest rate generally charged to investors. Mr. Bishop says he can't fully explain why the NAR estimate was about triple that of LoanPerformance. But he said NAR economists are "comfortable" with their survey data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR also reported strong demand for vacation homes, estimating that they accounted for 12% of the market in 2005, up from 11% a year earlier. Much of that demand comes from baby boomers in their peak earning years. The NAR said the median price of a vacation home rose 7.4% last year to $204,100. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[What's Brewing in the Real Estate Market]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hurricane-Proof?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With hurricane season less than two months away, one developer is trying to lure wary condo buyers to Brunswick, Ga., for a safe harbor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Waxman, a steel executive from Ohio, is about to start construction on Liberty Harbor, a nearly $2 billion project that will put 1,600 condos and single-family houses, 100,000 square feet of retail space, a 210-room Hyatt Regency and a marina on a 110-acre old industrial tract next to the waterfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when the condo boom is slowing nationwide, the developer is pitching Brunswick as charming coastal living, with hurricane protection. The city -- designed by Georgia founder James Oglethorpe, who also designed its more-famous cousin, Savannah -- is at the confluence of two rivers and St. Simons Sound, across from the beaches of the Golden Isles. More crucially for buyers worried about hurricanes, it's four miles inland from the Atlantic Ocean and 100 miles from the Gulf Stream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are the westernmost port on the East Coast," says Brunswick mayor Bryan Thompson, who welcomed the development by slashing red tape to speed the influx of development into the 150-year-old port city, which has struggled since its shipyards shut down after World War II. "It's basically a hurricane hole."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales begin in May and construction a couple months later, but the developer already has been pitching the project's relative hurricane safety at boat shows in Florida. It seems to be working: Liberty Harbor already has 1,200 people who have paid $1,000 each to get on its waiting list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No Frills</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mighty National Association of Realtors, with more than 1.2 million members, probably isn't rattled just yet. But a rival trade group, the American Real Estate Broker Alliance, is preparing to launch this week with 10 charter members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The alliance, known as Areba, represents firms that charge a flat fee for helping consumers sell a home. By contrast, traditional brokers charge a percentage of the sales price, often 2.5% to 3% for the listing agent. Areba members advertise homes in multiple-listing services and provide a limited range of other help to sellers for a fixed fee, typically several hundred dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flat-fee agents feel threatened by laws passed in about a dozen states that require all brokers to perform certain services, including negotiation, whether or not consumers want to pay for them. State Realtor associations have supported those "minimum-service" laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to stand up and fight for consumer choice," says Albert Hepp, the owner of BuySelf Realty, Bloomington, Minn., an organizer of the alliance. He estimates that more than 1,000 brokerage firms, mostly tiny, offer flat-fee service in the U.S. Just Winter Blues?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. apartment vacancy rate bumped up in the first quarter to 5.8% from 5.7% -- the first increase since the fourth quarter of 2004. Driving the change: so-called negative absorption, meaning fewer units were occupied at the end of the first quarter than the previous one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lloyd Lynford, chief executive of Reis Inc., a New York-based real-estate research firm that reported the increase, says it will take a few additional quarters of negative absorption before it is a more definitive sign of market weakness. Winter months often are slow due to the holidays and depressed in the Northeast and Midwest due to the cold weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Memphis, Tenn.; Wichita, Kan., and Indianapolis tied with the highest vacancy rates, at 10.1%, while Fort Lauderdale recorded the lowest at 2.7%, followed by New York at 2.8% and Los Angeles at 3.3%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Memphis market has been slow for a while, says Thomas Toomey, chief executive of United Dominion Realty Trust Inc., an apartment real-estate investment trust. Three years ago, the company owned 2,000 apartments there. Today, that number is down to 400. One reason: minimal wage and job growth reduces apartment owners' ability to raise rents.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Manufacturing Slowed in March As New Orders Fell</span>
</div><div class="author">By Christopher Conkey </div><div>458 words</div><div>4 April 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A closely watched reading of the manufacturing sector weakened in March, but still points to solid economic growth in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, an Arizona-based group representing corporate-purchasing managers, said its index of manufacturing activity dropped to 55.2 in March from 56.7 in February, pushed lower by a decline in new orders and employment. Nevertheless, readings over 50 indicate expansion, so the data suggest that the nation's factories in March enjoyed a 34th consecutive month of growth. At 55.2, the ISM index for March was only slightly lower than the 55.4 monthly average over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we have enough momentum that the second quarter is going to be a good quarter," said Norbert Ore, Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s procurement director, who oversees the ISM index. Despite the decline last month in new orders, a good indicator of future activity, Mr. Ore said manufacturers are still seeing enough demand to boost production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One source of demand is coming from foreign sources. The ISM said its export index rose to 57.3 from 57 in February, the 40th consecutive monthly advance. Haseeb Ahmed, an economist with J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co., said the ISM's recent readings signal "considerable strength in the export sector consistent with strong global-growth trends." Many economists expect rising demand from abroad to cushion any slowdown in domestic consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the downside, the ISM said its index of prices paid by manufacturers jumped to 66.5 in March from a reading of 62.5 in February. Prices for commodities such as aluminum, copper and steel were responsible, based on strong global demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors said its index of pending homes sales, which is based on signed contracts for houses, slipped 0.8% to 117.7 in February from January, the fifth decline in the past six months. The index is 5.2% lower than it was a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists see the housing market as stabilizing after its recent slowdown. David Lereah, NAR's chief economist, said he expects a "historically-strong housing market moving forward . . . and fairly stable levels of home sales with some month-to-month fluctuations." Others see further cooling ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the slowing sales pace hasn't put much of a dent in housing construction. Yesterday the Commerce Department said construction spending rose 0.8% to an annual rate of $1.185 trillion in February from $1.176 trillion in January, boosted by a 1.3% gain in residential building. Commercial construction was up 0.8% from January. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Simon </div><div>1733 words</div><div>28 March 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS THE SPRING selling season moves into high gear, the cooling housing market is upending the conventional wisdom that guided buyers and sellers during the housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changing dynamics have implications for a wide variety of players in the real-estate market. Some brokers are advising sellers to price their homes in the bottom 25% of comparable properties. People looking to enter the market for the first time are being told not to overly stretch their finances because rising home prices may no longer bail them out. Employees that are relocating are being advised to steer clear of new subdivisions where competition from brand new construction could make reselling soon difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such strategies aren't entirely new, but they had fallen from favor in many markets as home sales heated up early in the decade. Recently, markets have shown signs of cooling. The number of homes for sale has climbed about 30% over a 12-month period, reaching its highest level in nearly 10 years, according to the National Association of Realtors. The group recently predicted sales of existing homes would drop 5.7% this year versus a 4.4% gain in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher mortgage rates are making houses less affordable in many metro areas. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages now average 6.46%, up from 6.14% a year ago, according to HSH Associates, with rates on adjustable-rate mortgages moving up even faster. Another increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, expected today, could push mortgage rates even higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What this new environment means for buyers and sellers varies from market to market. To be sure, sales are strengthening in some markets, including Albuquerque, N.M., and Indianapolis. Economic growth and an influx of investors have helped to push home sales in Houston up 13% in the first two months of 2006 from a year earlier, says Steve Barnes, president of Coldwell Banker United, Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in many parts of the country, after several years of sellers calling the shots, 2006 is shaping up to be a market in which buyers are gaining bargaining power. In New York City, where the housing market has begun to cool, some buyers are now getting condo developers to pay city transfer taxes and certain other expenses that can total 3% to 4% of the purchase price, says Jeffrey Jackson, chairman of appraisal firm Mitchell, Maxwell &amp;Jackson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What follows is a look at what this means for different groups of buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Say goodbye to the days when sellers could simply look at what their neighbor's house sold for and then list theirs for 10% more. Brokers are advising sellers to make sure their house comes across as a good value relative to other homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Pricing is absolutely critical right now," says Rosey Koberlein, chief executive of Long Realty Co. in Tucson, Ariz., where sales are off 20% so far this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In determining a home's value, Richard Druker, a managing broker with Baird &amp;Warner in Chicago, considers everything from the height of the ceiling to the quality of any renovations and whether the front door creates a good first impression. "A great thing to do is to look at properties that are priced comparably to yours and ask, `Which would you rather buy?' " he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overpriced homes may never even catch the eye of their intended audience. That's because buyers and brokers increasingly rely on computers to screen listings based on price, size and other parameters when new properties come to market. Also, listings typically generate the most excitement and interest in their first few weeks on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David D'Ausilio, a broker-associate with Re/Max Heritage in Westport, Conn., is counseling his clients to price their homes in the "bottom 25%" of comparable homes and to cut their asking price by 3% to 5% if the listing doesn't generate several showings or written offers within three weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers are also telling sellers to fix problems that buyers might have overlooked in a more heated market. Bo Menkiti, president of the Menkiti Group of Keller Williams in Washington, D.C., recently advised one couple to replace their old stove and refrigerator in their otherwise updated house. While the return on the investment was likely to be minimal, "you don't want to leave things that would be a total turnoff," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-Time Buyers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the housing market cools, first-time buyers have the opportunity to be more thoughtful about their purchases and to negotiate for a lower price, a more flexible move-in date, or incentives such as seller-paid closing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jill Green, a Realtor with Century 21 Award in Carlsbad, Calif., a coastal community north of San Diego, has been making offers that are 1% to 5% below the low end of the seller's price range. "Sellers are entertaining the offers and are taking them," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some brokers are advising first-time buyers to leave a financial cushion instead of stretching as much as possible and counting on rising home prices to bail them out. They are also asking sellers to help with closing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elise Owen, a program manager for a nonprofit group in Washington, recently purchased a one-bedroom condo for $178,000. The seller threw in $5,000 toward closing costs. "It allowed me to feel like I was on more secure ground by keeping some of my savings available" for emergencies, Ms. Owen says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Move-Up Buyers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Move-up buyers face the delicate task of balancing a purchase with a sale. A growing number of buyers are making offers that are contingent on selling their current home. But such offers are often frowned at, in part because these deals are more likely to fall through. "You're going to get the house for a better price if it's noncontingent," says Jane Powers, a broker with Ewing &amp;Clark Inc. in Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some parts of the country, such as California's Silicon Valley, cooling is most evident in the higher end of the market, good news for homeowners looking to trade up. "For an extra half-million dollars, you can get quite a bit more for your money than you did before," says Richard Calhoun, broker-owner of Creekside Realty in San Jose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relocaters</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who are relocating for a job often can't afford to let their home sit. Tim Popadic last summer listed his four-bedroom colonial in Monroe, Conn., for $725,000, $26,000 above his broker's initial estimate, after he accepted a position as an associate pastor with a church in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. When no offers materialized, he delayed his move and cut his price three times, before accepting a $557,000 offer in October. "At the end of the day, [the broker] was right," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employers are looking for ways to ensure that homes don't languish on the market when an employee relocates. The number of company-ordered appraisals is growing as employers seek to get the price right before a house goes on the market, says H. Cris Collie, executive vice president of Worldwide ERC, an association of companies and professionals that relocate employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going forward, Mr. Collie expects employers to more aggressively enforce policies that require transferees to price their homes close to the appraised value. He is also seeing renewed interest in "loss on sale" programs, which compensate people who are relocating for losses if they sell below the purchase price. One in three large companies now offers these policies, according to a Worldwide ERC survey, down from 42% in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making sure the new house will be easy to resell is also crucial for people who are likely to be transferred again in a few years. "In a down market only the nicest homes sell quickly," notes Bradford Charnas, president of Charnas Appraisal in Cleveland. Mr. Charnas advises transferees to look for homes that are in top-notch condition and in an excellent school district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some relocation experts also advise transferees to shy away from buying a home in a brand-new development. "If you're buying in a new subdivision . . . you're competing with new construction" when you sell, notes Pam O'Connor, president and chief executive of Leading Real Estate Companies of the World.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the housing market cools, investors used to seeing quick profits in once hot markets such as Phoenix, Washington, and southern Florida, may be disappointed. In Tampa Bay, Fla., investors can still find buyers for one-of-a-kind homes in established neighborhoods. But in some new subdivisions, dozens of similar investor-owned homes are competing for buyers, says Craig Beggins, president of Century 21 Beggins Enterprises. "If you have any way not to sell right now, don't," Mr. Beggins tells investors. "If the neighborhood is brand new and no one is living there, my advice is to rent it if they can."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the decision to sell or rent can be tricky, particularly if the rental income isn't enough to cover the mortgage and other carrying costs. Rental homes typically don't show well, says Bob Hamrick, broker-owner of Coldwell Banker Premier in Las Vegas, and often must be vacated and given a fresh coat of paint and new carpet before they are put back on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors are turning to stagers to give a vacant new home personality. Rebecca Grainger, co-owner of Staging Masters Inc. in central Florida, hangs towels in the bathrooms and rents furniture for key rooms, such as the foyer, living room, dining room and master bedroom. "We're basically making it like a model home," she says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. sales of new homes in February took the biggest one-month drop in nearly nine years as inventories soared, in the latest sign that the housing market is cooling. Meanwhile, a separate report used to forecast the health of the manufacturing sector offered a mixed reading.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Commerce Department Friday said newly built single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.080 million units in February, a 10.5% drop after a revised 5.3% decline one month earlier. The February drop was the largest since the same percentage decrease occurred in April 1997.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new-home data followed Thursday's more optimistic report on existing-home sales. The National Association of Realtors said February sales of previously occupied homes, which account for about 85% of the residential market, climbed 5.2%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reality regarding the state of housing demand "is probably somewhere in between the two reports," said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital Markets. Economists point out that the new-home sales series is extremely volatile during the first few months of the year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the most troubling factor was the sharp rise in inventories. There were about 548,000 homes for sale at the end of February, representing a 6.3 months' supply at the current sales rate. That was up from a 5.3 months' supply a month earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Commerce Department Friday said new orders for durable goods -- vehicles, machinery, appliances and other items intended to last more than three years -- rose a greater-than-expected 2.6% to $215.8 billion in February. The increase followed a revised 8.9% plunge a month earlier. But stripping out the volatile transportation category, new orders for durable goods declined 1.3% in February, following gains of 1.6% in January and 1.9% in December.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By June Fletcher </div><div>1949 words</div><div>27 March 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>R4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE VACATION-HOME market certainly has changed since I dove into it not that long ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Aug. 30, 2004, the very day I took my only son to his first day at college, I went trolling through home listings on the Internet, and wound up making an offer on a second home in Naples, Fla. Freud probably would have had a field day with that, but I wasn't just trying to distract myself from the pangs of an empty nest. If I was going to get the vacation home I had been dreaming of, there was no time to waste.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, real-estate prices were rocketing and supply was scarce, especially in resort towns like Naples, which sits on the Gulf of Mexico in southwest Florida. As was true in other coastal towns, relatively modest places like the one I bought, a three-bedroom condo near the beach, were being snapped up within days or even hours of being put on the market, sight unseen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It didn't even matter that hurricanes were blasting through the gulf almost weekly. Buyer mania was so strong that I drove from the airport to my first walk-through inspection of the home in the furious rain and whipping winds of Hurricane Jeanne; at one point, I raced my rental car past a palm tree leaning over the road at an alarming angle and watched in my rear-view mirror as it crashed to the ground. I felt pressure to close the sale quickly, since would-be buyers started putting backup offers on the home almost from the moment my full-price offer of $225,000 was accepted. I didn't want the sellers to look for reasons to back out of the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home grew in value at supersonic speed even while the sale was in escrow. Judging from sales of comparable units, in the five months between my purchase offer and my first mortgage payment, my beach place appreciated by more than $150,000, a gain of more than 66%. It had taken more than five years for my primary home in the Washington, D.C., suburbs to grow two-thirds in value. At the end of 2005, the median price of a single-family home in Naples reached $367,100, a 36% gain over the year before, almost three times the national appreciation rate. I felt like I'd won a palm-fringed lottery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are clear signs that the tide is turning in Naples. Inventory levels now are four times as high as they were a year ago, local real-estate agents say, largely because nervous investors are trying to cash out their gains before rising mortgage interest rates topple the market. "Big price reduction" ads are starting to pop up in the thick weekly real-estate sections of the Naples Daily News. Worse, at the end of 2005 Naples was 96.3% overvalued -- based on historical norms for home prices, household income, population density and other factors -- according to a quarterly analysis of 299 housing markets by Boston-based research company Global Insight Inc. and Cleveland financial holding company National City Corp. That made it the most overvalued housing market in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hand me my crying towel, please.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, Naples isn't the only second-home mecca that the report calls overvalued. Others include Santa Barbara, Calif. (76.7%), Bend, Ore. (68.4%), and Miami (60.8%). Indeed, coastal areas popular with vacationers and investors are by far the most likely to have had unsustainable price increases, says National City's chief economist, Richard de Kaser, who conducted the study. He notes that 18 of the 20 most overvalued markets in the country are in California and Florida; the most undervalued markets are in the center of the country, including Texas, Minnesota and Michigan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As recently as the end of 2003, Mr. de Kaser says, only seven towns were considered extremely overvalued -- 30% or more out of line. Now 71 are, representing 42% of all of the housing value in the country. That shouldn't matter to people who are buying in an overvalued spot for the long term, he says, but it should matter if you plan to sell within a few years. "It's absolutely not the time to take risks," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, vacation-home buyers, take heed: The days when you could flip a beach house or ski place for fun and profit are probably over. That doesn't mean that you should avoid a second home altogether, but it's time to take a serious look at the economic factors that propel vacation markets, and to weigh the financial costs of ownership. Here are some things to consider:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHO'S BUYING -- AND WHO CAN'T?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seems every real-estate agent says that now -- whenever that happens to be -- is the best time to buy, but obviously, that's not always the case. So before you invest in any resort town, check on the dynamics of the local real-estate market and on the area's economic health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, look at who's buying. Are new households coming into the area, and why or why not? Are homes selling mostly to investors, part-time owners or permanent residents? Too many investors can leave a market vulnerable to substantial price swings. A preponderance of part-timers can drive up prices and drive out locals. Permanent residents lend the market stability. Real-estate agents and local lenders are good sources for this kind of information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second-home buyers should look into school quality and the general affordability of homes in the area, even if these issues don't affect them directly, says Ken Libby, a real-estate broker in Stowe, Vt. "They affect the long-term prognosis of the community," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the schools are terrible or declining, permanent residents may be inclined to move away, leading to vacation-home ghost towns and depressed real-estate values. You can get information on school performance from real-estate agents or from the Web site of the state education department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers also need to ask about job growth in the area they're considering. If year-round residents can't find work, they won't be able to buy homes. But even if job growth is strong, affordability is important. While part-time residents may not give much thought to where the local teachers, firefighters, police officers and restaurant workers live, they should, many real-estate agents say, because when these workers get priced out of the market, essential services suffer -- and so do home prices. And there's a warning signal here: According to the National Association of Realtors, in the fourth quarter of 2005, housing affordability hit its lowest level since 1991.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW EASY IS IT TO SELL?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing markets take a long time to change from boom to bust, because homeowners often are loath to accept that things have changed. A home can linger for months on the market before a seller finally realizes that he isn't going to get the same price that his neighbor did during last summer's price peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some statistics are early warning signs that a market is in decline, and you can find these in local newspapers, online or by talking to real-estate agents or local government officials. If inventory levels or foreclosure rates start to rise, or the average number of days that homes in the area sit on the market starts to creep up, the market may be turning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, look at what big home builders are doing, especially if the number of permits being issued starts to decline, since they keep a close eye on markets and pull out at the first sign that they're becoming overbuilt. Once builders start giving away freebies like finished basements, watch out -- if they feel the need to give incentives, it could well be because the market is softening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts and new-home closed sales and presales are also worth tracking, but bear in mind that these can remain high even in markets that are in the early stages of decline, since before builders can cut back, they must first finish constructing and selling the homes they already have in the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DOES RENTING MAKE MORE SENSE THAN BUYING?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to a number of Web-based calculators, it's now relatively easy to compare the cost of renting versus owning. For instance, using the online "rent versus buy" calculator at TCalc.com, I computed the cost of a home for five years at a purchase price of $425,000 versus renting it at $1,500 a month, with a 1% increase in rent each year. I assumed a 5% down payment of $21,250, a 30-year fixed-rate loan at 6.9% with one point, $4,250 in closing fees, $583 annually in homeowner's insurance, $390 a month in condo association fees, a 1.25% property-tax rate, a 6% annual home-price appreciation rate, and a 28% tax bracket. Under this scenario, buying wins -- largely because of equity buildup and mortgage interest deductions. Over the five-year span, the calculator shows, you'd spend $83,218 to rent the home, compared with $53,759 to buy it -- a saving of $29,459.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But online calculators are imperfect when it comes to vacation homes. First, renters rarely rent vacation homes for an entire year -- they rent seasonally. Seasonal rents are often double what annual renters pay, but they only obligate the renter for a short period of time. So a renter who paid $3,000 a month would be out $9,000 for a three-month season, compared with $12,222 for the owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An owner has other costs the renter avoids. Equipping a three-bedroom home with all of the stylish furnishings and electronics upscale buyers demand can cost upwards of $20,000. And when it comes time to sell, unless you want to take on the responsibility of marketing your own home, you'll have to pay a real-estate commission. At 6%, that would come to $25,500 for the purchase price assumed above. So the gains you make from owning rather than renting can easily be wiped out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can recoup some of your costs by renting out the home when you're not around, but according to the National Association of Realtors, eight out of 10 vacation-home buyers choose not to do that. Perhaps that's because renting out a home entails a host of other expenses that can run into the thousands of dollars, including repairs, cleaning, advertising and professional property management -- an expense that by itself can eat up as much as 30% of the rental income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, the decision to buy a vacation home rather than renting it will probably come down to more than economics -- just as it did with me in my mad-dash pursuit of a Naples beach house. But whether you're looking for a weekend getaway, an eventual retirement home, or a gathering spot to pass on to the grandchildren, don't let the sunlight dazzle you. In this cooling housing market, you are probably going to be spending your vacations there for a long, long time.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kemba J. Dunham </div><div>646 words</div><div>25 March 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes in February took the biggest one-month drop in nearly nine years as inventories soared, in the latest sign that the housing market is cooling. Meanwhile, a separate report used to forecast the health of the manufacturing sector offered a mixed reading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department Friday said newly built single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.080 million units in February, a 10.5% drop after a revised 5.3% decline one month earlier. The February drop was the largest since the same percentage decrease occurred in April 1997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new-home data followed Thursday's more optimistic report on existing-home sales. The National Association of Realtors said sales of previously occupied homes, which account for about 85% of the residential market, climbed 5.2% in February. Economists, however, suspect sales were inflated by unusually warm weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reality regarding the state of housing demand "is probably somewhere in between the two reports," said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital Markets. Economists point out that the new-home sales series is extremely volatile during the first few months of the year. Mr. Stanley added that such huge monthly increases and declines aren't uncommon and there usually are significant revisions to the data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, "the main message is that new-home sales are coming off at a faster clip than we had expected," said Haseeb Ahmed, an economist at J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co. That was illuminated this past week when KB Home, one of the nation's largest home builders, said new-home orders fell 12% during its first quarter ended Feb. 28.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Commerce Department Friday said new orders for durable goods -- vehicles, machinery, appliances and other items intended to last more than three years -- rose a greater-than-expected 2.6% to $215.8 billion in February. That is up from a revised 8.9% plunge a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the durable-goods picture tends to be muddled because month-to-month changes can be extreme, particularly in the areas of defense and aircraft. Indeed, the February increase was fueled by a 52.5% rise in civilian aircraft orders and a 104.1% rise in defense orders. Also, the January plunge stemmed from a 70.1% decline in civilian aircraft orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stripping out the volatile transportation category, new orders for durable goods declined 1.3% in February, following gains of 1.6% in January and 1.9% in December. Orders for motor vehicles dropped 3.3% in February after a 3.2% decline in January. Meanwhile, nondefense capital-goods orders excluding aircraft -- considered an important indicator of future business-equipment investment -- fell 2.3%. Though the decline follows a four-month cumulative increase of more than 6%, some economists were nevertheless disappointed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While nothing is falling apart, there is clearly a softening on the domestic variables that influence manufacturing," said Cliff Waldman, economist for Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the new-home sales report, economists said the most troubling factor was the severe climb in inventories. There were about 548,000 homes for sale at the end of February, representing a 6.3 months' supply at the current sales rate. That is up from a 5.3 months' supply a month earlier. Some pointed out that this could have reflected an increasing number of speculators putting homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price of a new home declined to $230,400 in February from $234,200 a month earlier, while the average sales price rose to $296,700 from $287,200.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laurence Norman </div><div>478 words</div><div>25 March 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B5</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. Treasurys rose sharply Friday, with prices bid up after the Commerce Department reported a decline in February new-home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late trade, the benchmark 10-year note was yielding 4.67%, compared with 4.73% before the data. The two-year note's yield stood at 4.71%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rally occurred after the Commerce Department said new-home sales in February fell 10.5%, the sharpest decline in nearly nine years. Economists expected a more modest 2.4% decline. The data are the latest sign of a possible slowdown in the U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move ran out of steam by midafternoon and yields began to edge up again. Treasury prices move inversely to yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's rally erased the losses U.S. government bonds had suffered Thursday after the National Association of Realtors reported a surprise gain in February existing-home sales. Analysts said Friday's weak data would matter more to policy makers than Thursday's data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are very sensitive to weak housing data because they think that this will be the trigger to a weakening economy," said Lundy Wright, managing director in charge of government trading at Nomura Securities in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Declines in mortgage applications and median home prices already had hinted at a housing-industry slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 4 p.m., the 10-year note was trading at 98 21/32 points, up 17/32 point, or $5.3125 per $1,000 face value, to yield 4.673%, down from 4.741% Thursday. The two-year note was up 3/32 point to 99 27/32 to yield 4.718%, some 0.04 percentage point above the 10-year yield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate Bonds</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The speculative-grade-rated bonds of Lucent Technologies Inc. rallied Friday -- tracking its stock and the shares of France's Alcatel SA -- after the telecommunications-equipment providers said they were in talks to merge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lucent's 6.45% bonds due 2029 were quoted late Friday up 8 1/2 points, or cents on the dollar, at a midpoint price of 92, according to a market analyst. Lucent's credit-default swaps, contracts that investors use to make bets on a company's creditworthiness, tightened to a midpoint of 1.35 percentage points, about 1.1 percentage points narrower from Thursday, the analyst said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Murray Hill, N.J.-based Lucent has credit ratings three notches lower than Alcatel from Moody's Investors Service, Standard &amp;Poor's and Fitch Ratings, so the combination would provide a boost to Lucent's creditworthiness, said Kim Noland, director of high-yield research at Gimme Credit, a research firm.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kemba J. Dunham </div><div>536 words</div><div>24 March 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously occupied homes jumped in February, but economists suspect that the data were distorted by unusually warm weather in some parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes -- including single-family houses, townhouses, condominiums and cooperatives -- increased 5.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.91 million units in February. That is up from an upwardly revised pace of 6.57 million units in January. Sales of existing homes account for about 85% of the residential market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, the Realtors' chief economist, said warm weather in January prompted home buyers to shop in a month of normally scant sales. The Realtors' figures count home sales based on closings; many home sales that closed in February, were initiated in January. "Spring selling season started a little earlier because of the warm weather," Mr. Lereah said, "but I expect the numbers to come down a bit in the next few months."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose 19.2% in the Northeast and 11.1% in the Midwest -- areas where weather was unseasonably warm. Sales were up 5.1% in the West and declined 2.5% in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage applications, an indicator of future home purchases, declined sharply last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The group's seasonally adjusted index of loan applications for home purchases stood at 393.6 in the week ended March 17, down 26% from the peak in June 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, inventories of homes on the market continued to rise. The Realtors said there were 3.03 million existing homes available for sale at the end of February, up 5.2% from January. At the current sales pace, it would take 5.3 months to sell all homes available for sale. The last time inventories exceeded 5.1 months of sales was April 2003, when they reached 5.12 months of sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Realtors' report, the national median price of an existing home for all housing types was $209,000 in February, up 10.6% from $189,000 a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason for the sharp year-to-year median-price increase isn't clear. In some cases, it could reflect a changing mix of homes being sold. As mortgage rates rise, some lower-income home buyers may be priced out of the market, lifting average prices. According to Freddie Mac, the average rate on a 30-year conventional fixed-rate mortgage was 6.25% in February, up from 6.15% in January and 5.63% in February 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists note that because Realtors data look at year-to-year price comparisons, it is too early to see more recent price changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Labor Department said the number of U.S. workers filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits declined 11,000 to 302,000 for the week ended March 18. The previous week's revised figure was 313,000. The four-week moving average was 303,500, an increase of 6,000 from the previous week's revised average of 297,500. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Steven C. Johnson </div><div>735 words</div><div>24 March 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prices of U.S. Treasury securities declined, weighed down partly by firmer-than-expected housing data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors had been positioned for a weaker set of existing-home-sales figures for February, particularly given recent data showing a drop in mortgage applications and other signs of a cooler housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the housing numbers disappointed, "it was then a matter of momentum" that pushed the market lower, said Michael Pond, Treasury and inflation-linked strategist at Barclays Capital in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing data, along with a larger-than-expected decline in first-time jobless claims last week, suggested the U.S. economy continues to advance, and some traders said that bolsters the case for the Federal Reserve to push overnight lending rates to at least 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal-funds rate, the key overnight interbank lending rate, stands at 4.5% and is widely expected to reach 4.75% when the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets March 27 and 28.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One of the reasons some were expecting the Fed to pause or stop altogether was the effect of slowing home-price appreciation on the consumer, but these numbers still look healthy, and if the Fed's looking at this, they see the housing industry is not slowing down, and the consumer is not slowing down," said Rick Klingman, head of Treasury trading at ABN Amro in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Pond said the jury is still out on a 5% fed-funds rate, pointing to recent Fed assertions that policy will be dependent on coming data. "That's not going to be answered today or tomorrow. We've got a lot of data between now and [the next FOMC meeting in] May, so it's tough for the market to either price it in or take it out with certainty."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 9/32 point, or $2.8125 per $1,000 face value, to 98 4/32 points. The yield rose to 4.741% from 4.705%, as yields move inversely to prices. The two-year note dropped 2/32 point to 99 23/32 to yield 4.773%, bringing the yield gap to a negative 0.03 percentage point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent economic data and technical trading factors should cause the yield curve to invert further, BNP Paribas analysts in New York said. Contributing to that will be new supply; the Treasury Department plans to sell $22 billion in fresh two-year notes and $14 billion in five-year notes March 27 and 28, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hawkish comments from a European Central Bank official also were weighing on Treasurys, said Andrew Brenner, head of institutional investing at Hapoalim Securities in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yves Mersch, an ECB member governor of the Luxembourg central bank, said monetary authorities must "monitor very closely, or should I even say vigilantly, prices within the euro zone."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate Bonds</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Motors Corp. sold a 78% stake of GMAC Commercial Holding Corp. to a group of investors led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;Co., Five Mile Capital Partners and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners for almost $9 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company previously had said it was targeting the sale of a 60% stake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale of the General Motors Acceptance Corp. 's commercial-mortgage unit had been expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2005, after it was announced in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim Nelson, credit analyst at U.S. Bancorp Asset Management, with $95 billion in total assets, including GMAC and GM debt, said that the important thing for investors is that the sale of GMAC's commercial mortgage unit "got done."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late yesterday, GMAC's 8% bonds due 2031 were flat at 92.75 cents on the dollar, according to MarketAxess, an electronic-trading service for corporate bonds. GM's 8.375% bonds due 2033 were down one point at 74.6 cents on the dollar.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reinventing Itself</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Upscale Mecca</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fort Lauderdale's move from hard-party capital to high-end tourist destination will be on display in September, when the luxury St. Regis Resort opens on the site of the former Candy Store lounge and its trademark wet T-shirt contests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is just one of many changes as this South Florida seaside community once synonymous with lowbrow spring-break shenanigans reinvents itself, capturing the attention of more buttoned-down real-estate investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The region is gaining thousands of new condominium units and has attracted about $1 billion in new high-end hotel properties coming on line from 2004 through 2009. Museum Plaza, the onetime headquarters of video company Blockbuster Inc. in downtown Fort Lauderdale, is getting a makeover from N.R. Investments of Miami Gardens, Fla., which purchased the vacant offices in January for about $130 a square foot. Office condos in the updated property are now being marketed at prices starting at $290 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent strengthening of the region's commercial and residential real-estate market can be traced in part to the nation's housing boom as well as the city's decision in the 1980s to send young revelers packing. That's when the city banned open containers of alcohol and changed traffic patterns to stop cruising cars crammed with rowdy college students. "The changes were important in order to be taken seriously in business," says Fort Lauderdale Mayor Jim Naugle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The size of the bets on the Fort Lauderdale residential market suggests investors are serious. About 4,671 new condominiums were completed last year, with about as many scheduled to come on the market this year, says Gleb Nechayev, senior economist with Torto Wheaton Research. Investors also purchased about 15,000 apartment units to convert into condominiums last year, the fourth-highest volume among the country's major markets, according to Real Capital Analytics Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sandwiched between Miami and Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale, with its sunny weather and wide beaches, has drawn retirees and job seekers who helped push the region's population up 2.1% in December to 1.8 million from a year earlier, according to Moody's Economy.com, a unit of Moody's Corp. Growth in smaller professional-services firms and a robust construction sector sent employment levels soaring 4.5% in January from the year earlier, about three times the national rate of 1.5%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market does have its risks. Last fall, Hurricane Wilma badly damaged a number of office buildings in downtown Fort Lauderdale, and at least one office-property sale broke down in the wake of the storm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The specter of a slowdown in the region's hot residential market also looms. Until now, rising median home prices -- $369,000 in December, up 22% from a year earlier -- have helped drive up land prices and damped new commercial construction, increasing rents and driving vacancies down to below-average levels in the retail, office and warehouse sectors, according to Property &amp;Portfolio Research Inc. But unit sales of existing single-family homes and condos fell 39% in January from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some residential developers are confident they can adjust their housing mix to withstand any drop in demand. Rockefeller Group Development Corp. of New York plans to begin construction next month on a mixed-used development called Miramar Town Center that will contain about 500 residential units. "If we were trying to get top dollar, that would give us more concern," says John Petricola, the group's regional director. "We're being very careful to make sure they're positioned around the market's median price." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Today's Market Forecast]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KB Home's Turn</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expect more bad news about the U.S. housing market when KB Home reports quarterly results today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the annual report it filed last month, the company said it saw more order cancellations in December and January, and fewer net orders than it had in the year-earlier period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That weakness likely persisted into February. Last week the Federal Reserve's "beige book" -- a roundup of anecdotal reports on business conditions gathered by the Fed's regional banks -- pointed to further cooling in the U.S. real-estate market in February. And builders surveyed by the National Association of Home Builders have been ratcheting down their outlook on the business since last summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the question among investors has shifted from "When will housing slow down?" and "Is housing slowing down?" to "How bad is the slowdown going to be?" and "How badly will it affect the home builders?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KB Home will likely point to its just-opened Martha Stewart-branded community in North Carolina, where homes have been selling well, as a reason for optimism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is unlikely to be enough to settle investors who are increasingly uneasy about the health of the U.S. housing sector. But perhaps some news from across the pond will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.K. has been far ahead of the U.S. in the housing cycle. The Bank of England started raising interest rates before the Federal Reserve, and the U.K. residential real-estate boom ended in the summer of 2004. And guess what has been happening? The shares of home builders have been on a tear lately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One example is a home builder called Wilson Bowen, which reported earlier this month that its profit declined 14.5% in the year ending December, thanks to the U.K.'s housing slowdown. Yet its share price has risen more than 40% since late October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turns out that U.K. home builders played the boom less aggressively than they had in past, and so didn't get hurt as badly when the market slowed. Many U.K. home builders have been able to reward investors with continued dividend increases, and investors rewarded them with richer stock-market valuations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home builders say that they have been more conservative, too. Now it is their turn to prove it.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Tim Annett </div><div>806 words</div><div>17 March 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists expect the pace of foreign investment in the U.S. to slow in the wake of a Dubai-based company's abortive takeover of terminal operations at five American ports. They believe the impact will be enough to dent economic growth, though most don't expect a significant slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the government reported that consumer prices and housing construction eased last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly half of the 56 economists polled in the latest WSJ.com forecasting survey -- conducted from March 10 to March 14 -- say the rate of increase in foreign direct investment in the U.S. will be lower in the next few years than in recent years. Some indicated that the slowdown will be a direct result of the controversy over Dubai Ports World's U.S. port acquisitions. Others said the slowdown will be the inevitable aftermath of a period of sharp growth. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. rose 20% in 2005 to $128.63 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Kasriel, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, said growth in foreign investment in the U.S. will slow because "expected returns on capital are probably higher in other economies -- especially developing ones."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, 49% of those polled said the rate of increase would slow; 33% said it would be about the same; and 16% said it would be greater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifty-six percent of the economists polled say they expect some slowdown in U.S. growth over the next several years because of a trend toward protectionism. Eight percent predict the impact will be significant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, many economists revised upward their estimates of economic growth for the quarter ending March 31. The consensus estimate of economists calls for real gross domestic product -- the nation's broadest measure of economic output, adjusted for inflation -- to expand at an annual rate of 4.6% in the first quarter, up from last month's estimate of 4.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Gains in employment and wages, combined with strong business investment and exports, should spark both consumer and capital spending," said William Hummer, chief economist at Wayne Hummer Investments in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation forecasts were little changed. The economists expect, on average, that the consumer-price index -- the most widely watched inflation barometer -- will increase 3% for the 12 months ending May, the same rise predicted in last month's survey, and 2.3% in the 12 months ending November, down slightly from 2.4% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday that the CPI rose 3.6% last month from a year earlier and 0.1% from January, when the CPI rose 0.7%. The "core" CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, increased 0.1% from January and 2.1% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Inflation is still very much under control," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight in Waltham, Mass. "Across the board, just about every [price] component showed small increases. . . . High energy prices just aren't spilling over into the broader economy. This is very good news."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While inflation fears are easing, economists showed more concern about the housing market. Thirty-five percent of the economists surveyed by WSJ.com believe a weakening housing market is the biggest downside risk to their GDP forecasts this year, while 18% identify higher-than-expected interest rates and 16% peg higher-than-expected energy prices as the greatest potential spoilers. When asked what factor is most likely to surprise them on the positive side -- and, thus, make their current forecasts too low -- 29% said lower-than-expected energy prices. About one-fifth cited stronger spending by consumers and another fifth stronger business spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported yesterday that housing construction slowed slightly in February, though to a level still high by historical standards. Housing starts were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.12 million in February, down 7.9% from the upwardly revised January level and down 4.8% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits for residential building, a gauge of builders' confidence, were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.145 million in February, down 3.2% from January but up 2.5% from a year earlier. Though they declined from January's level in most of the country, permits were up 3.4% in the West last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial jobless claims rose by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 309,000 in the week ended March 11. That was the highest level since the week ended Dec. 24, 2005. Despite the rise, economists said the labor market remains healthy.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>610 words</div><div>14 March 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> disclosed still more accounting problems and reported a further decline in its share of the U.S. mortgage market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government-sponsored provider of funds for home mortgages didn't provide an estimate of the financial impact of the latest problems. But Fannie said that -- based on its current "view" of its accounting errors -- the company believes it still meets its minimum capital requirements. <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>'s regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, raised those capital requirements 30% in the wake of an accounting scandal that erupted in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new problems include improper accounting for certain investment securities and for some of the fees and obligations that arise from Fannie's guarantees of payments on mortgages bundled into securities and sold to investors world-wide. The newly disclosed problems also relate to accounting for the costs of dealing with houses acquired through foreclosures, for debt restructurings and for interest on delinquent loans, among other things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest errors come on top of more than a dozen violations of accounting rules already identified by regulators, a team of outside lawyers and Fannie executives. The company is working on a restatement of results for the past several years and reiterated that it doesn't expect to provide results for 2004 before this year's second half. As part of that restatement, Fannie has estimated that it will have to book $10.8 billion of losses on derivatives used to hedge against interest-rate risks. Those losses will have to be recognized for the years when they occurred rather than over several years, as was the case under former policies at the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie estimated that its share of the U.S. market for issuing new mortgage-related securities fell to 24% in 2005 from 29% in 2004 and 45% in 2003. Investment banks and large mortgage lenders have grabbed much of that share by taking the lead in creating mortgage securities out of subprime loans, which are those for people with flawed credit records, and so-called Alt-A loans, which fall slightly short of prime status, often because the borrower's income or assets haven't been fully documented. But Fannie said it hopes to play a bigger role in the subprime market and is working on ways to share risks on subprime mortgage securities with other investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie also hopes to regain market share as rising interest rates prompt more people to refinance from adjustable-rate mortgages to fixed-rate loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cleaning up the books and dealing with investigations and shareholder suits is proving costly. Administrative expenses totaled $2.18 billion last year, up 44% from 2004. In a conference call, Fannie executives said they are spending about $50 million a month on consultants and other outside experts helping with the restatement and related accounting and corporate-governance projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie lowered its estimate of its after-tax losses from last year's hurricanes Katrina and Rita to a range of $250 million to $400 million. Previously, Fannie estimated that the storms could result in losses for the company of as much as $550 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Mudd, Fannie's chief executive, said in the conference call that the company expects home sales to decline 8% this year and home prices to rise an average of 3%, down from the double-digit pace of recent years. In some of the housing markets that have been hottest, "we could see some price declines," Mr. Mudd said. </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A housing-industry group expects sales of existing homes to drop 5.7% this year as mortgage rates and home prices climb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said it expects sales to decrease to 6.67 million from a record 7.08 million in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales are expected to decline 7.7% to 1.18 million from a record 1.28 million in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group said the national median existing-home price for all housing types is projected to rise 5.8% in 2006 to $220,300. The median new-home price should increase 5.4% this year to $250,200, it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The cooling from overheated sales conditions in recent months is helping to bring inventory levels up to the point where buyers have more choices than they've seen in the last five years," said David Lereah, chief economist at the NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Annual price appreciation is still running at double-digit rates, but the cause of those sharp increases is going away," Mr. Lereah said. "As the market readjusts, price appreciation should return to more normal rates of growth this year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR said the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage should increase gradually to 6.9% in the fourth quarter. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[What's Brewing in the Real Estate Market]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Switching Tracks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The folks in charge of transforming New York's historic James A. Farley Post Office into a welcoming new train station seem to be changing architects like Mr. Rogers changed shoes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First there was Hellmuth, Obata + Kassabaum, or HOK, one of the country's largest architecture firms. In the early 1990s, its New York office created a master plan for Amtrak to move train services into the old postal building from across the street at Pennsylvania Station. Then federal funding disappeared. When more money was scrounged up, a team of government agencies issued a new solicitation for architects. David Childs of venerable architecture firm Skidmore, Owings &amp;Merrill won the competition with a sketch for a train receiving hall topped with a crescent-like glass roof. It was nicknamed the "potato chip" for its curvaceousness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, Amtrak bowed out of the project, citing budget concerns. The state Moynihan Station Development Corp. dropped Skidmore when it went looking for a private development team without Amtrak. The state selected real-estate duo Steven Roth of Vornado Realty Trust and Stephen M. Ross of Related Cos., who in turn hired HOK to create a new, more cost-effective plan. HOK's new scheme also had a glass roof but evoked the original Pennsylvania Station, with tall columns supporting an undulating glass canopy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, says a spokesman for Messers. Roth and Ross, the pair have gone back to Mr. Childs to redesign this project, which could cost close to $1 billion. It isn't yet clear if the potato chip will return as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vanishing Act</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of affordable apartments continues to dwindle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report due for release today, Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies says the U.S. is losing more than 200,000 rental units each year as a result of demolition, conversions to condominiums and other factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While such government initiatives as the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit contribute more than 100,000 new units of affordable rental housing each year, that is still less than the number of low-rent units that are vanishing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a concern that some think is somewhat underplayed. "In this country, we are so focused on homeownership -- that's the headline," says Nicolas P. Retsinas, director of the Joint Center. "But rental housing is a very important part of the marketplace."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 20% of renters have median annual incomes topping $60,000, but renters at the middle and lower end of the market feel most squeezed, according to the study. Median asking rent in the U.S. rose to $974 a month in 2004 from $734 in 1994. But for that same period, monthly renter income grew only to $2,348 from $2,272.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, William Apgar, senior scholar at the Joint Center, believes favorable demographics and the maturation of the so-called echo baby boom -- the children of baby boomers -- should ensure that the market-rate rental market expands in the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe's House Party</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The European housing market remained generally buoyant last year, but the fun may end this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the United Kingdom, house prices rose about 3% in 2005, compared with 12% in 2004, according to a report by the U.K.'s Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Estonia and Denmark had the highest level of house-price inflation, at 28% and 22%, respectively. House-price increases in Spain, Sweden and France were next highest, up 15%, 12% and 10%, respectively, the report shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But report author Michael Ball warns that European Central Bank rate increases could have a significant impact on house prices, particularly in countries such as Spain and France. Already, house prices in Germany continued to stagnate in 2005, with prospects for 2006 not looking promising with an end to government subsidies for owner-occupied housing. Mr. Ball doesn't expect a housing-market crash, but the report notes, "There are signs that 2006 will signal a marked reduction in house-price growth across Europe."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Orders to U.S. factories plunged by the largest amount in 5 1/2 years in January, reflecting a big drop in demand for airplanes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported that orders for manufactured goods fell 4.5%, the first decline after three consecutive gains, and the biggest drop since an 8.7% plunge in July 2000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weakness came from a plunge in orders for commercial and military airplanes. Excluding the volatile transportation sector, factory orders rose 1.6%, the best showing in five months. Analysts said this advance showed that manufacturing was doing well at the start of the new year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total orders for transportation products dropped 31% in January as demand for autos edged down 0.4% and orders for commercial aircraft fell 68.3%. Orders for military aircraft dropped 20.9%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big declines in aircraft orders were viewed as returning demand to a more normal level after huge gains in prior months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for durable goods -- products such as machinery and household furnishings that are considered useful for at least three years -- declined 9.9% in January, a slight improvement from the 10.2% drop the government initially estimated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for nondurable goods increased 2.2% in January following smaller gains of 0.5% in December and 0.9% in November.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, a leading indicator of U.S. housing demand fell in January for the fifth straight month, reaching a level almost 5% below a year earlier, a real-estate industry group reported.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said its index for pending sales of existing homes was down 1.1% in January to 116.3, and that was 4.8% below the same month a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group noted, however, that the rate of decline in January was lower than the average monthly decline of nearly 3% in the previous four months, declines that followed a record 128.2 reached in August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, NAR's chief economist, said the latest reading shows a flattening out that is in line with "the soft landing we've been expecting" for the housing market. "We are at a much more sustainable level of home sales now -- a welcome cooling from the super-heated conditions that were driving exceptional price gains," Mr. Lereah said.  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Factory Orders Slid 4.5% in January --- Biggest Drop in Over 5 Years Reflects Aircraft Weakness; Home-Sales Index Declines</span>
</div><div class="author">By Rafael Gerena-Morales </div><div>564 words</div><div>7 March 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factory orders took their steepest drop in more than five years in January, pulled down by a sharp decline in orders for airplanes. Excluding aircraft, however, factory orders were robust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders for manufactured goods in January fell 4.5% from the previous month, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. That was the sharpest decline since an 8.7% drop in July 2000, and largely reflected a 31% decline in orders for transportation products and equipment, such as autos and airplanes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the volatility of aircraft orders, economists often look at factory orders excluding transportation, to better gauge the economy's underlying health. That indicator posted 1.6% growth in January, the biggest gain in five months. And an important barometer of business spending -- orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- rose 0.1% in January and was up 7.5% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall orders for durable goods, including electronic equipment, were off 9.9%, also the sharpest decline since July 2000. Durable goods are big-ticket items expected to last at least three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday's data "confirm that underlying manufacturing conditions remain upbeat," said Conrad DeQuadros, a senior economist at Bear Stearns Cos. "Businesses are fairly confident that this [economic expansion] is sustainable. They feel further business investment is necessary" to keep up with demand in coming months, which will stimulate additional spending, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. DeQuadros projects that spending on business equipment in the first quarter will rise roughly 10% from the fourth quarter, and that the steady demand should help the economy offset the effects of a softening housing market this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, an Indian airline ordered 68 planes from Boeing Co. in a deal valued at around $11 billion. That will likely push February's aircraft orders sharply higher when they are reported next month. Moreover, U.S. companies hope that the Indian air force will buy about 125 fighter jets in the near future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, data released yesterday by the National Association of Realtors showed the housing market continued to slow in January. The trade group reported that its index of pending sales of existing homes, which includes single-family units, condos and co-ops, fell 1.1% in January from December and was down 4.8% from a year earlier. After peaking in August the index fell an average of nearly three percentage points a month through December. The current index is based on contracts signed in January, which typically close within two months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, NAR's chief economist, points to January's 1.1% decline, after sharper drops in preceding months, as evidence that the housing market is "plateauing." He adds: "We're at a more sustainable level of home sales right now. Demand is still strong but we're seeing a transition from a seller's market to a buyer's market. This is a soft landing scenario."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, other analysts warn that the slowdown could be painful, at least for sellers. Daniel Oppenheim, a housing analyst at Bank of America Corp., reported last week that his monthly survey of real-estate agents in February showed flat or lower prices in 13 of 20 major metropolitan areas. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Simon </div><div>1632 words</div><div>4 March 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WITH THE HOUSING market cooling, a number of people are backing out of their agreements to buy new homes -- spawning some opportunities for bargain hunters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, new-home buyers must sign a contract and cough up a hefty deposit, even if their house won't be built for months. But that isn't stopping them from saying "no thanks." In recent months, there has been an uptick in buyers asking for their money back or even walking away from their deposits entirely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Los Angeles-based KB Home said cancellations rose in December and January, and luxury-home builder Toll Brothers Inc. told analysts that its cancellation rate had increased in the fourth quarter. Other builders are also seeing more deals falling through. A recent survey by the National Association of Home Builders found that 20% of builders were seeing cancellation rates somewhat or significantly higher than six months earlier; just 8% reported rates somewhat or significantly lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is particularly noticeable in many California markets and in Washington, D.C.; Phoenix; and Chicago, according to an analysis of 16 major markets prepared for The Wall Street Journal by Hanley Wood Market Intelligence. In Sacramento, Calif., for instance, the number of cancellations quadrupled in last year's fourth quarter from the year-earlier period. The typical reasons: Buyers can't sell their current home, or they are having trouble getting a mortgage or fear that they may be buying at the top of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some builders are responding by rolling out incentive programs designed to move these spurned dwellings. In Phoenix, Beazer Homes USA Inc., of Atlanta, is advertising reductions of as much as $44,000 on selected homes in its inventory. At some California properties, another builder is offering incentives that can include such things as new appliances and backyard landscaping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Virginia, Brookfield Homes Corp. is running a "FastMove" special with discounts on roughly 60 homes that are completed or will be ready in 30 days. Among the recent offers: a reduction of nearly $100,000 on a five-bedroom, 4 1/2-bath home in Lansdowne, originally priced at $997,925. "A lot of those properties were originally sold to someone else," says Gregg Hughes, a general sales manager in Virginia for Brookfield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When housing prices are shooting upward, cancellations aren't a problem for builders. They simply put the units back on the market -- often at a higher asking price. But in markets where sales are slowing and inventories of unsold homes are on the rise, higher cancellation rates can create new opportunities for buyers. In some cases, builders are selling completed homes at prices lower than those charged for units still under construction; in others, they are offering other incentives, such as free upgrades or builder-paid closing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deals typically are short-lived and aren't available in all markets or even in all communities in a particular market. But some analysts expect them to become more plentiful this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless you have a compelling need to move, "it's better to be prudent and wait," says Ivy Zelman, a housing analyst with Credit Suisse. "It seems as if the builders are going to get more aggressive and offer more discounts that will make it more compelling for buyers." In some cases, she notes, buyers who thought they had nabbed a good deal have been surprised to find their builder offering a similar home at a lower price a few months later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not every cancellation creates an opportunity, but there are ways to sniff them out when they are happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers looking for special deals should check builders' Web sites for listings of completed homes or ones near completion, and for any special offers. Builders often run ads for "move-in specials" in newspapers. Real-estate brokers can often provide information about incentive programs in particular markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It doesn't hurt to ask, either. Some builders, such as Pulte Homes Inc., based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., "are very private about their incentives," says Rick Murray, a housing analyst with Raymond James &amp;Associates. "You are only aware of them upon taking a look at the community."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Pulte spokesman said the company doesn't have a national incentive program, and the use of incentives "is pretty much left up to the individual markets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are more likely to offer incentives if the home is near completion than if the buyer backed out early in the construction process. Other factors include the time of the year, the strength of the local housing market and even the attractiveness of a particular community. "You can be in a poor market with some good-selling communities" where the use of incentives is less likely, says Marshall Ames, director of investor relations for Lennar Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The higher cancellation rates right now are particularly notable because they come at a time when new-home sales are slowing in many of these areas. That is the case in Sacramento, where cancellations have jumped in part because buyers have pulled back from purchasing higher-end homes amid worries that they may be buying at the "top of the market," says Jonathan Dienhart, director of published research at Hanley Wood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, Hanley Wood saw higher cancellations in 10 of the 16 markets it examined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in deals falling through isn't limited to new construction. In a conference call with analysts last month, Cendant Corp. said its company-owned real-estate brokerage offices in Florida, southern California and New England saw a 30% increase in their cancellation rate in December. Cendant, of New York, says it reflects the departure of speculators from those markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larry Greenberg, a salesman for a surgical-supply company, is among those getting cold feet. Last summer, Mr. Greenberg put down an $80,000 deposit on an $810,000 condo-hotel unit in Miami's South Beach. When the developer recently approached him for an additional $80,000 down payment, Mr. Greenberg decided to back out. "It was too much risk for the potential reward," says Mr. Greenberg, who received his deposit back last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just how costly a change of heart can be depends on a variety of factors, including the terms of the buyer's contract, the reasons for pulling out and even the strength of the local housing market. Initial deposits typically range from as little as $1,000 to 10% of the purchase price. In South Florida, some developers now require a 20% deposit, says Jack McCabe, chief executive of McCabe Research &amp;Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many builders say they will generally return a deposit if the borrower can't obtain mortgage financing. Beyond that, policies vary. In a recent conference call with analysts, Toll Brothers, of Horsham, Pa., said it retains the "vast majority" of deposits from buyers who cancel. At D.R. Horton Inc., a builder based in Fort Worth, Texas, division presidents have discretion over whether a deposit is returned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Refunds are less likely if the buyer has made custom changes, for instance, like adding purple countertops that must be ripped out before the house is sold to another buyer. Miami-based Lennar says it may seek verification if a would-be buyer decides to cancel because of illness, divorce or other personal hardship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In these conditions, some buyers could find themselves on the hook for more than their initial down payment. If a house is resold for less than the original purchase price, "we are able to go back to the initial purchaser and recoup some of the losses we had there," says Mr. Hughes of Brookfield Homes, based in Del Mar, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One person's buyer's remorse can be another's opportunity. Beazer Homes, the company with Phoenix-area properties, recently advertised price reductions of $16,000 to $44,000 on completed homes in the region. The company has roughly 100 completed homes in inventory there, many of which came back on the market in the last month because of cancellations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mercedes Homes Corp. recently ran specials to move homes that are completed or near completion in North Carolina and certain Florida markets. "We don't want to carry those homes [in inventory]," explains Mark Neubauer, president of sales and marketing. However, prices have moved up enough that Mercedes is selling some of these homes for more than the original purchase price, even after factoring in the discounts, Mr. Neubauer says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, Meritage Homes Corp., of Scottsdale, Ariz., began heavily promoting a "Done Deal" promotion in Sacramento that offers buyers of homes that are completed or nearing completion incentives valued at $20,000 to $90,000. They can include not only backyard landscaping and new appliances, but also window coverings and as much as $15,000 toward closing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The message has resonated with buyers," says Boyd Roberts, vice president of sales and marketing for the Sacramento region, noting that Meritage sold 34 homes in the area in February, up from 23 in January. The promotions were triggered in part by a spike in cancellations at the end of the fourth quarter as some investors got cold feet and other buyers ran into trouble selling their current homes, Mr. Roberts says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Diego, cancellations reached their highest level in years in 2005, says Philip Romero, chief executive of Award-Superstars, which operates real-estate brokerages in southern California. "A lot of those cancellations have been replaced by new buyers" drawn in by price reductions and other promotions, Mr. Romero says.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Consumers Give Year a Robust Start --- Income and Spending Gains Augur Strong GDP Growth; Lift From Medicare Benefit</span>
</div><div class="author">By Rafael Gerena-Morales </div><div>935 words</div><div>2 March 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong income gains and unseasonably warm weather prompted consumers to spend more money than usual in January. Along with data showing manufacturing activity expanded in February, that suggests the economy is on track for robust first-quarter growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal income of Americans increased 0.7% in January, the biggest jump since September, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The gain amounted to roughly $75.2 billion. At the same time, consumer spending increased 0.9%, about $76.7 billion, the largest climb in six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The January spending jump follows a soft fourth quarter, which led economists and retailers to worry about an economic slowdown. But the latest data confirm other recent reports that show consumer spending picked up again in January, and that the broad-based gains should ripple throughout the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending is "strengthening sharply in the first quarter" said Dean Maki, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Capital. He estimates that consumer spending in the first quarter will grow at an annualized rate of 4.5% or more, compared with 1.2% in the fourth quarter. Spending is "recovering after the post-hurricane lull" and sluggish auto sales late last year, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The large gain in personal income was the result mainly of rising wages and salaries, which partly reflects rising employment. The economy added 193,000 new nonfarm jobs in January. But Uncle Sam also contributed to the January income increase as the Medicare prescription-drug plan, an increase in cost-of-living adjustments for recipients of Social Security and some other federal programs boosted transfer payments. Meantime, pay raises for federal civilian and military personnel boosted government wage and salary disbursements. Excluding these special factors, personal income increased 0.4% in January, BEA says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seniors receiving prescription-drug benefits through Medicare are "definitely the winners" in this group, said Brian Bethune, an economist with forecaster Global Insight in Lexington, Mass. With Uncle Sam picking up some of the bill for medicine, seniors "have more disposable income. This is money that would have come out of their pockets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists noted that consumer spending in January also benefited from some one-time effects, some of which may not spill over into subsequent months. This past January was the warmest January in 100 years, allowing consumers to shop more than they normally would in the middle of winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday's report showed that January spending rose across the board. Sales of durable goods, those designed to last three years or longer, rose 1.3% in January. Nondurable-goods spending rose 2.3%. Spending on services rose 0.1%, as homeowners spent less money on utilities to heat their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans continued to spend more than they earned, as the personal-saving rate was a negative 0.7% in January. That continues a trend stemming from 2005, when the saving rate was negative for an entire year for the first time since the Great Depression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as consumers boosted spending in January, the "core" inflation rate remained tame. The Commerce Department reported that its index for personal-consumption expenditures -- excluding food and energy -- increased 0.2% in January from a month earlier, and rose 1.8% from a year ago. The Federal Reserve's so-called comfort zone is considered to be 1% to 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Activity among manufacturers is also picking up. The Institute for Supply Management, a private research group, reported yesterday that its manufacturing-activity index improved to 56.7 in February from 54.8 in January. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. The group reported that its categories for new orders, production and employment all rose as factories benefited from strong U.S. consumer and global demand. However, manufacturers reported paying higher prices in February, compared with a month earlier, for goods including rubber, plastics and metals, according to ISM.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taken together, yesterday's batch of economic reports portray the economy as running "not too hot, not too cold," said Global Insight's Mr. Bethune. He estimates that the economy is currently expanding at a 5% annual rate. When combined with the fourth-quarter's 1.6% growth rate, it shows that growth for the two quarters is averaging 3.3%. That pace should be enough to "keep the [business] investment cycle rolling," and stimulate more economic activity as businesses purchase more equipment, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, other data released yesterday showed that housing prices continue to climb. The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight reported that U.S. home prices increased an average of 12.95% in the fourth quarter, compared with a year earlier, indicating continued pricing strength. Areas with some of the biggest price gains included the Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale region of Arizona, the Orlando-Kissimmee area of Florida, and El Paso, Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On average, U.S. home prices rose 12.55% in the third quarter, according to Ofheo, which supervises mortgage-finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But economists noted that the data is backward-looking and may not yet reflect some cooling in the market that began late in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department reported yesterday that total construction spending in January rose 0.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.16 trillion. Wall Street analysts had expected construction spending to climb 1% because of warm weather in January.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average U.S. home prices jumped 12.95% from the fourth quarter of 2004 through the fourth quarter of 2005, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency, responsible for overseeing the financial safety of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said appreciation for the most recent quarter was 2.86%, or an annualized rate of 11.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest increase is similar to the revised increase of 12.55% for the year ended with the third quarter of 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Despite recent indications that a slowdown may be forthcoming, house-price appreciation during 2005 continued to hover at near-record levels," Ofheo's chief economist Patrick Lawler said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While deceleration continues in some areas, appreciation generally is still extremely strong," Mr. Lawler said. "Mortgage rates climbed significantly during the second half of last year, but the effect of that increase on price appreciation so far appears to be limited." </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy expanded at a slightly stronger pace at the end of last year than earlier estimated, but while growth is expected to rebound sharply to start 2006, fresh readings on home sales and consumer confidence hinted at bumps on the road ahead.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Commerce Department said yesterday that gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the economy, grew at a 1.6% annual rate in the fourth quarter, compared with the 1.1% pace reported earlier. Stronger inventory building by businesses bolstered growth, but consumer outlays, which account for two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose just 1.2%, well below the third quarter's 4.1% advance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown is widely expected to be temporary. A poll of forecasters released this week by the National Association for Business Economics sees first-quarter U.S. GDP rising 4.5%, then settling into a 3.3% pace for all of 2006.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joshua Shapiro of Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc. wrote in a note that neither the slow growth of the fourth quarter nor the expected rebound to start this year are likely to last. "Our forecasts for the subsequent three quarters of the year, which call for growth of a little under 3%, are more reflective of sustainable rates of expansion," he wrote.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market, which has provided a boost to economic growth for several years, is beginning to show signs of slowing. A report from the National Association of Realtors yesterday showed sales of existing homes fell 2.8% in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.56 million units. Sales of condominiums and co-ops were particularly weak, falling 10.6%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Existing-home sales should stay below the record levels experienced for the last two years, but they'll maintain a historically high pace," said David Lereah, chief economist of the Realtors association.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Conference Board, a private U.S. research group, said yesterday that its index of consumer confidence for February fell to 101.7 from a revised 106.8 in January. The present-situation index, a gauge of consumers' views of current conditions, rose to 129.3 from 128.8 the prior month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note to clients that while confidence readings appear to run in sympathy with the twists and turns in gasoline prices, "it is also possible that the softening housing market is beginning to affect people's views of the future."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes fell in January for the fifth straight month, and the inventory of unsold homes rose, providing more evidence of weakening in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, a closely watched gauge of consumer confidence declined last month, driven lower by a drop in expectations for the economy over the next six months. Nevertheless, a separate government report showed that economic expansion wasn't as sluggish in late 2005 as initially thought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes, which account for about 80% of the residential market, fell 2.8% from December to an annual rate of 6.56 million units. While prices were unchanged from December, the number of unsold homes increased 2.4% to 2.91 million, a 5.3-month supply that is the largest in almost eight years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with a year ago, the annual pace recorded in January was 5.2% slower, prices were up 11.6% and the supply of unsold homes jumped 43.2%. The recent trends indicate that the balance of power in the housing market, which clearly tipped in favor of sellers over the last few years as home values soared, is gradually shifting to buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condominium sales plummeted 10.6% from December, and the average sales price fell to $216,900 from $225,200 but was still 5.5% higher than a year ago. Sales of single-family homes slipped 1.5%, but the average price increased to $210,500, a 13.1% gain over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The boom is over," said David Lereah, the NAR's chief economist. "Investors are pulling out in a lot of the nation's hot markets, and that's adding to the cooling."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lereah forecasts 6.74 million sales of existing homes this year, a level below the last two years but still high by historic standards. For February, he expects annual price appreciation, which ran over 10% last year, to ease back into the single digits before finishing the year around 6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board said its index of consumer confidence fell to 101.7 in February from 106.8 in January, even though sentiment was more upbeat about current economic conditions. The reason: Consumer expectations for the next six months deteriorated to a three-year low, excluding the months immediately after Hurricane Katrina last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumers are growing increasingly concerned about the short-term health of the economy and, in turn, about job prospects," said Lynn Franco, director of the group's research center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a dash of positive news in the rear-view mirror, however. The Bureau of Economic Analysis said the economy expanded at a 1.6% annual rate in the fourth quarter, better than an initial projection of 1.1%, as estimates of business and government activity both rose</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The BEA report showed inflation easing somewhat. The price index of consumer expenditures, excluding food and energy, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, rose at a 2.1% annual rate in the fourth quarter, down from an initial estimate of 2.2%. By this measure, core inflation rose 2% in 2005, a level near the upper end of the Fed's informal comfort zone. </p>
