<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: I live in Bethesda, Md. Most people around here put their homes on the market in the spring, when everything is in bloom. But I need to sell my home now. What can I do to make it more marketable?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Although winter is the most challenging time to put your house on the market, you can turn the season to your advantage if you emphasize the qualities that make your house more inviting than the competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some tips:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keep up with maintenance. In their rush to get their homes ready to show, many sellers forget to button up their homes for the winter. But buyers will notice the icicles that form when gutters aren't cleaned, and will feel the drafts from windows that haven't been weather-stripped. If you need to move out before your house is sold, don't forget to turn off the valves to outside spigots and drain them so pipes don't freeze and burst. Also, if your house is vacant, hire someone to make sure tree branches felled by ice are hauled away, your walks, steps and driveway are always kept free from snow, and floors aren't dirty with tracked-in salt and sand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take down holiday decorations. Although some agents think holiday lights and Christmas trees make a house festive, they can be a turn-off to buyers who don't share your religious beliefs -- particularly in an area like yours, which has a diverse population. It's better simply to stick to hot cider and a roaring fire during your open houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emphasize energy efficiency. Buyers are always interested in knowing a home's operating costs, but these concerns naturally come to the fore during winter. List everything you have done to your home to make it more energy efficient, from beefing up insulation and wrapping pipes with foam sleeves to replacing windows and appliances. You might want to copy utility bills and leave them out for showings as well. (To foil potential identity thieves, black out your account number.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lighten up. Everyone wants more light in the winter, so make your house is as bright as possible. Window screens block an amazing amount of sunshine, so put them in storage (don't toss them, though -- home inspectors will note if there are any missing). Have your windows cleaned and take down heavy draperies. If your house is unoccupied, put some lights on timers so it will look inviting from the street at night. Also, consider putting motion detectors on walk-in closet lights, so they'll turn on when buyers open the door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Show other seasons. Even though buyers can't see your azaleas in bloom under the snow, you can help them visualize other times of year. Hang or arrange photos of your house with the maple tree in full glory on the mantel, or buy a digital picture frame and upload photos you may have taken of the flower beds in different seasons. Put it on the kitchen table, next to the stacks of brochures, so buyers can't miss it. Also, use landscaping software to create a diagram of your yard. Mark what's planted in beds and identify the types of trees and shrubs, as well as any water features or statuary that might be covered up by snow. (A hint: If your family is in the pictures, crop or Photoshop them out; you want buyers to project themselves mentally into the scene.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Update Web photos regularly. These days, homes can spend weeks on the market -- though agents sometimes try to hide that fact by withdrawing and then relisting houses. But buyers can immediately spot a stale listing if the photo is out of season. I hope your house sells quickly, but if it doesn't, please make sure that you or your agent updates photos on Web sites and marketing materials as soon as the trees leaf out and the daffodils start to bloom.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Older Americans who banked on selling their homes to finance care in assisted-living facilities and retirement communities have seen their dreams go up in smoke amid the housing-market bust. At the same time, their investment portfolios have nose-dived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In these rough economic times, funding long-term care poses a challenge for seniors and their families. There are a range of strategies you can pursue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For people without long-term care insurance, which is the majority, the financial hit can be hard if care is needed. The average cost of a private room at a nursing home runs $76,500 per person annually, while a one-year stay in a one-bedroom unit in an assisted living facility costs $36,000 and periodic care from a home health assistant at $18,000 or more per year doesn't come cheap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there are no easy answers, shopping around, switching the care setting, pooling family finances and looking at loan options can be conduits to affordable care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many independent-living and assisted-living facilities, in particular newer facilities or those that embarked on ambitious expansion plans when the economy was riding high, are offering specials to boost flagging occupancy rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many facilities are offering to defer rent until seniors can sell their homes or are offering lower introductory rates for the first six months" as sweeteners, says John Temple, chief operating officer at A Place for Mom Inc., a national senior-housing referral service. (The service is provided free to consumers. A Place for Mom is compensated by the facilities when a senior is placed.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many facilities will waive the "community fee," a deposit typically equivalent to one-month's rent, for those who ask. The best deals to be had are often at smaller residential homes because they need to fill vacancies quickly and have more latitude to cut individual deals, according to Mr. Temple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Continuing-care retirement communities, which offer more health services as seniors age, typically require entrance fees of hundreds of thousands of dollars, plus monthly fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheryl J. Sherrard, a certified financial planner at Rinehart &amp;Associates in Charlotte, says switching to a smaller apartment can be a money-saving strategy for older Americans who've set their hearts on moving into a specific retirement community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've seen communities allow couples to move in with a percentage of the entry fee due initially, but a delay on the remainder being due for a period of six months after move-in," giving seniors wiggle room to complete the sale of a house, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Retirement communities backed by nonprofit religious organizations can be a more-affordable option," says Karen Schaeffer, president of Schaeffer Financial in Rockville, Md. (These communities welcome people of all beliefs.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Temple recommends asking independent and assisted-living facilities about "non-premium rooms" that can be real bargains, but generally aren't advertised. Longer walks to the dining room and less desirable layouts or views account for the cheaper rates. Having a roommate might not be everyone's cup of tea, but "companion rates" can shave $1,000 a month off rent for single seniors who are willing to share, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Widening your geographic search even by just a few miles can produce more budget-friendly options, says Karen Altfest, vice president of L.J. Altfest &amp;Co. Inc., a fee-only financial-planning firm in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Family members can pitch in toward the cost of care in a variety of ways. For instance, individuals can make gifts of up to $12,000 per person per year without paying a federal gift tax. That exclusion amount will increase to $13,000 in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another option is an intrafamily loan. This could provide a mechanism for adult children to lend money to cash-strapped parents who need funds now to pay for care until they can sell their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reverse mortgage is another option. Reverse mortgages enable homeowners age 62 or older, who own their home outright or have a small mortgage balance to convert home equity into cash without selling the house. The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage, or HECM, insured by the Federal Housing Administration and backed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, is the most popular kind. Lending institutions also offer their own proprietary products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The amount you can borrow will depend on your age, how much your home is worth and current interest rates. For a HECM the limit is $417,000, but proprietary products may allow you to borrow more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Payments can be taken as a lump sum, in regular installments or as needed, or through a combination of these options. The accrued principal and interest comes due when the last borrower dies, sells the home or moves out permanently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big drawback of a reverse mortgage is the high fees, which closely mirror the closing costs on a regular mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For this reason, says Sue Hunt, a housing counseling programs manager for Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Greater Atlanta, reverse mortgages tend to make the most sense for people who want to spend the rest of their lives in their homes and whose total income, including the loan, will be sufficient to cover all their future expenses, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With any type of loan, it's important to ensure you understand the fees, interest rates and repayment terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, an important safety feature of an HECM is that your payments from the lender are guaranteed by the federal government. Plus, if your home is sold for an amount lower than the value of the loan, neither you nor your heirs will be liable for the balance, which isn't always the case with proprietary products.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lingling Wei and Jon Hilsenrath </div><div>1387 words</div><div>22 December 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a record amount of commercial real-estate debt coming due, some of the country's biggest property developers have become the latest to go hat-in-hand to the government for assistance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're warning policymakers that thousands of office complexes, hotels, shopping centers and other commercial buildings are headed into defaults, foreclosures and bankruptcies. The reason: according to research firm Foresight Analytics LCC, $530 billion of commercial mortgages will be coming due for refinancing in the next three years -- with about $160 billion maturing in the next year. Credit, meanwhile, is practically nonexistent and cash flows from commercial property are siphoning off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike home loans, which borrowers repay after a set period of time, commercial mortgages usually are underwritten for five, seven or 10 years with big payments due at the end. At that point, they typically need to be refinanced. A borrower's inability to refinance could force it to give up the property to the lender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent letter sent to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, and signed by a dozen real-estate trade groups, painted a bleak scenario: "Right now, we believe there is insufficient systemic capacity to refinance expiring, performing commercial real-estate loans," said the letter. "For many borrowers, [credit] simply is not available," the letter noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To head off some of the impending pain, the industry is asking to be included in a new $200 billion loan program initially created by the government to salvage the market for car loans, student loans and credit-card debt. This money is intended to go directly to help investors finance purchases of securities backed by these assets. If commercial real estate is included, banks might have an incentive to make more loans to developers since they'd be able to repackage and sell them more easily to investors with the assurance of government backing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of their lobbying efforts, some industry representatives have asked lawmakers to explore the idea of setting up a separate program aimed at boosting lending to commercial real estate only.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been urging Washington to put this as one of the top priorities in dealing with the economy," says Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, underscoring the need for the government to help spur commercial property lending either directly or indirectly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate executives are warning that the approaching surge in commercial mortgages coming due poses another major threat to the global financial system, which already is on life support. With rent prices falling and vacancies rising due to the weakening economy, delinquencies on commercial mortgages already have begun to rise sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Up until now, delinquencies on commercial real-estate loans have stayed below historical levels thanks in part to the limited amount of speculative construction in recent years. But now they're rising at a time when a huge volume of loans are coming due and some of the few institutions that were still making loans are retreating from the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The credit crisis has got so bad that refinancing of even good loans may be drying up," says Richard Parkus, head of commercial-mortgage-backed securities research at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial real-estate owners, of course, are just the latest to get in line in Washington, D.C., for the billions of bailout dollars that the government has begun to hand out. Other businesses that have received or are campaigning for some form of aid include banks, credit-card issuers, car companies and even farm equipment maker <span class="companylink">Deere &amp;Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate owners are pressing the government to take preemptive action before thousands of properties begin to fail. Among those who have been active in the lobbying effort: William Rudin, whose family is a large Manhattan office-building owner, Stephen Ross, chief executive of The Related Cos., a major U.S. developer, and Steven Roth, chief executive of office and retail landlord <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, industry representatives have met with officials in the Treasury Department, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, senior lieutenants of Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairwoman Sheila Bair, members of President-elect Barack Obama's transition team, and Sen. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One potential challenge for the industry: Though some Treasury and Fed officials are worried about the impact of its troubles on credit markets, other sectors -- such as the residential mortgage and auto industries -- are more pressing concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury and Fed officials have said they would consider including commercial real-estate in the new $200 billion loan initiative. But such a step won't happen soon. The program is not likely to be operational until February. Even then, expanding it to include the immense commercial real estate market would likely require additional financial support from the Treasury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the Treasury has agreed to backstop the Federal Reserve on as much as $20 billion of losses on the program. That means Treasury will take the first $20 billion of any losses using funds approved by Congress for the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's widespread agreement that a record volume of commercial real-estate loans made during the boom years are starting to come due. According to Foresight Analytics, the $530 billion of commercial mortgages that will be maturing between now and 2011 includes loans held by banks, thrifts and insurance companies as well as loans packaged and sold as commercial-mortgage-backed securities -- or CMBS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the heart of the financing scarcity is the virtual shutdown of the market for CMBS, where Wall Street firms sliced and diced commercial mortgages into bonds. During the recent real-estate boom that took off in 2005 and lasted through early 2007, that market fueled the lending to real estate because banks could sell easily the loans they made. But the credit crisis that started in the summer of 2007 has put the securitization market on hold, which, in turn, has caused lenders of all stripes to become increasingly reluctant to make new loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While commercial real-estate developers restrained themselves during the boom years when it came to speculative development, property investors bid up the prices of office buildings, malls and other projects to record levels assuming rents and occupancies would keep rising. With cash flows now falling, a growing number of developers are having a tough time repaying their debt. In cases where owners need to sell buildings to satisfy loans, the current environment makes that difficult. A revitalized lending climate is necessary, they say, to keep them afloat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's not clear is how soon the crunch will come. The Real Estate Roundtable, a major industry trade group, predicts that more than $400 billion of commercial mortgages will come due through the end of 2009. Foresight Analytics estimates that $160 billion of commercial mortgages will mature next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff DeBoer, president and chief executive officer of the Roundtable, says the group came up with its estimate by looking at the $3.4 trillion of commercial real-estate loans outstanding. It's not unusual for roughly 10% of the industry's debt to roll over every year, he says, referring to refinancings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, some $141 billion worth of commercial real-estate debt owed by property owners and developers to lenders came due, according to Foresight Analytics. Most of that was refinanced or extended by existing lenders. The lion's share of those loans was made between five and 10 years ago. Despite the recent decline in property values, the underlying buildings were still worth well more than their mortgages and were generating sufficient cash to pay debt service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the delinquency rate on payments to mortgage lenders is rising, particularly for properties that were financed at the top of the market. Delinquencies on commercial mortgages jumped to 0.96% in November, up from 0.62% in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts predict the delinquency rate will leap to 2% by the end of next year. During the real-estate collapse of the early 1990s, the worst-performing commercial mortgages -- those that were made in 1986 -- sustained losses of about 10%.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Home Front; Hawaii's Highest End Slows Down; Demand softens for two exclusive gated communities; buyers say, 'I want a deal'</span>
</div><div class="author">By Candace Jackson </div><div>991 words</div><div>19 December 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; W8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kohala, Hawaii</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last decade, one of the most exclusive gated communities in the country emerged here, carved out of the bleak, lava landscape that dominates the west side of Hawaii's Big Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Visitors allowed past the gate-booth of Hualalai (pronounced ha-WAH-la-lye) enter an ersatz Hawaiian paradise of elaborate swimming pools, coconut body scrubs and butter-poached Kona lobster. Residents, who include <span class="companylink">Charles Schwab</span> and Michael Dell, scoot around the property on private golf carts. And at the property's Four Seasons hotel, guests like Leonardo DiCaprio, Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington spend a minimum of $800 a night -- one of the highest room rates in the state -- for bungalow-style rooms and a staff that spritzes sunbathers with Evian and will even shine their sunglasses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Hualalai and its gated neighbor Kukio, emerging meccas for the very rich, haven't proved immune from the recession. The hotel, which is undergoing renovations, offered fourth-night-free discounts in the fall amid an island-wide tourism slump. Buying in the community, where prices start at $1.8 million for an attached condominium, used to mean joining a two-year waiting list, says Gabe Winkler, a local real estate appraiser. Now there are 50 homes and lots on the market, double the number last year. Sales volume this year is expected to total about $115 million, half of 2007's record sales volume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Buyers even in high-end exclusive club or resort communities are saying 'I want a deal,'" says Sam Ainslie, Kukio's president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While wealthier communities were initially faring better in the housing downturn, the recent financial crisis is taking its toll on expensive resort areas. In Aspen, Colo., brokers say prices have softened anywhere from 10% to 15%. Mary Taaffee, a real-estate broker in Nantucket, Mass., estimates prices are down about 10% to 12%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers in Hualalai, which was purchased by Mr. Dell's private investment firm and investment management company Rockpoint Group in 2006, say the slowdown has been most dramatic at the lower end -- homes that sell for under $3 million. According to Rob Kildow, Hualalai's principal broker, sales at the higher-end continue, though at a slower pace. The last month, he says, has included the sale of a $9.175 million home and an $11.5 million home. A $17.25 million home is set to close soon, purchased by a real-estate executive from New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On this rocky stretch of lava, extreme physical isolation and high price tags allow the rich to feel at home. Surrounded by a lava field and fronted by a manned gate, Hualalai has emerged as something of an out-of-state country club for multimillionaires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After buying a home, residents then must join the private club restricted to homeowners in order to access the resort's amenities. Once accepted, there's a $225,000 deposit plus $28,000 in annual fees. Membership comes with access to the hotel's saltwater snorkeling pond, infinity pools, private restaurants and two private golf courses, including one that's only open to members and doesn't require tee times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Restaurant waiters say they frequently push tables together to accommodate impromptu dinner parties for friends who bump into each other. The community's four full-time concierges say they're often asked to print up a list of who's on property in a given week so members can call their friends right when they arrive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every Monday night around sunset, residents gather at a private beach club overlooking the ocean for an event regulars call the "merry moochers," where couples snack on shrimp bruschetta and drink free mai tais.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Waiters know their customers by name. "When I go any place [on the property], I am a queen," says Becky Holman, a Denver painter who lives at Hualalai about six months a year. "We know everybody."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners say they've noticed few changes since the onset of the recession. One homeowner says everyone in the community knows certain residents have lost wealth. But everyone's still flying in for the holidays and throwing the usual Christmas parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With 290 members and a busy 243-room hotel, Hualalai grew a little too large for some members' liking. So in 1999 several Hualalai members got together with developers to form Kukio, an adjacent gated community that vowed even more exclusivity and even higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Hualalai became a victim of their own success," says Michael S. Meldman, CEO of Discovery Land Co., which operates Kukio with financial partners. With a maximum of 197 members and no hotel, Kukio is "more like being at home," he says. The cost of being at home here starts at $4 million. (Jeremy Sosner, Hualalai's director of marketing, says the hotel helps support more amenities and that members "enjoy the vitality that the hotel guests bring.")</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few members from Hualalai and Kukio from the Bay Area got together to form a private flying club to get to and from the Oakland Airport, called the Kona Shuttle. For $100,000 members get up to 50 round-trip flights on an all-first-class 757 or 727 that seats 60 passengers. Flights operate on Thursdays and Sundays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One new Hualalai owner, John Guiltinan, of Newport Beach, Calif., bought a place in Hualalai in May. The shopping-center developer says he and his wife were drawn by the golf and the networking potential at Hualalai, and reports that they've already made friends with five or six couples. "There's more personal association," at Hualalai, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The snag: he still hasn't been able to sell his first home on the island. "It's tough times right now."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">What To Bid for Foreclosed Home? Our columnist advises a reader in Kissimmee, Fla., who is contemplating making an offer on a bank-owned property.</span>
</div><div class="author">By June Fletcher </div><div>606 words</div><div>18 December 2008</div><div>16:27</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: I am thinking about buying a foreclosed home in Kissimmee, Fla., that just went on the market. But both prices and interest rates seem to be getting lower every day, and I'm not sure whether I should put in a bid now or wait. If I do bid, how should I determine what price I should pay?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: You're not alone in wondering what to do. A new Harris survey reports that 80% of Americans now hesitate about buying a foreclosed home [http://blogs.wsj.com/developments/2008/12/16/people-more-hesitant-to-buy-foreclosed-homes/], compared to 69% in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there isn't much point in waiting, especially since you've identified a home that interests you. Although prices and interest rates have been dropping nationally, there's no way to predict exactly when the bottom of the any local market will be reached. So if the deal works for you, go for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, as to how much you should bid: That same survey, sponsored by Trulia.com and RealtyTrac.com, said that three-quarters of buyers expect to pay at least 25% less for a foreclosed home than a comparable market-rate home, and a third expect at least half off. But while those sorts of bargains do occur in some places -- in Pennsylvania, bank-owned homes are selling for 87% less -- you can't expect a steal everywhere. In fact, according to the survey, foreclosed homes in Florida overall are selling for a median price of $171,000, a 22% discount over market-rate homes statewide. In Kissimmee, they're selling for $164,500, only 16% less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reasons for these differences vary tremendously, from inventory levels and local employment prospects to the level of investor interest: Kissimmee, a suburb of Orlando, is more attractive to investors than cold Pennsylvania. Neighborhood matters, too -- discounts will be less in a well-kept locale where there are few other foreclosures -- as does the condition of the home itself. So it really isn't possible to generalize about how much of a discount you should expect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, use a buyer's agent experienced in foreclosures and knowledgeable about the neighborhood to get an opinion on a good bidding price. Ask the agent to explain the reasons for the price, comparing the home you want to those nearby that are for sale and that have recently sold. Visit as many comparable homes for sale as you can to get a personal feel of how the home you want stacks up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before you make a bid, you should also tour the foreclosed house with an inspector in tow. Although lenders usually are selling the homes as-is, and may balk at making repairs, you should have a clear idea of what you'll have to pay to make the home habitable -- especially if the previous owner walked off with everything from the chandelier to the refrigerator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An inspection will cost you a few hundred dollars. But the information that it provides will allow you to make a bid that will withstand a market that still may have a way to fall, yet won't be so low that the lender ignores it. And if you really want the house, don't wait too long to make your move. Many lenders have stacks of bids for foreclosed properties these days. Though they can be maddeningly slow in responding, they put reasonable offers at the top of their piles.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Ingeborg Schuetz moved into an independent living facility in Boca Raton, Fla., she thought it would be easy to sell her luxurious two-bedroom condo, replete with marble floors, stainless steel appliances and a wrap-around balcony with views of a private beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, more than 18 months later, the condo languishes on the market, even after a 30% price reduction. After being slapped with a $10,000 assessment for building renovations, a fee that coincides with her investments taking a 50% hit, the 85-year old German native may have to leave the retirement community. If she does, she risks losing most of her $200,000 entry fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If I could get rid of the condo, I would be the happiest person," she said. "Everything is very easy for me here. I have a nice place to live."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Schuetz isn't the only senior facing tough decisions because of the battered housing and financial markets. More people are having to delay moving into retirement facilities, or like Ms. Schuetz, they're worried about having the financial means to stay in one. Insurance isn't always enough, and families can't always help - they're also likely to be hit by job losses, falling house prices or evaporating wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's leaving some retirement community operators struggling to fill beds, which is forcing price cuts or specials. Financial advisers, meanwhile, report increased questions from frantic seniors and family members struggling to afford what were supposed to be the Golden Years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you look at the wealth portfolio of older people, so much of their wealth is tied to the value of their homes or the stock market, when both of those markets collapse as they've been doing, people are not going to have the flexibility anymore," said Rich Johnson, a retirement policy expert at the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Housing Hit</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing downturn, the worst this nation has seen in decades, is causing the most pain. Years ago, a home was a key asset purchased for the long term, with a goal of paying off the mortgage and tapping accrued equity to fund senior living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But plummeting housing prices, bloated inventory and tightened lending restrictions for even the most sterling borrowers have largely frozen the market, particularly in former bubble markets and troubled areas such as Detroit, which is hurt by the automobile industry's latest turmoil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, more seniors healthy enough to wait -- and hope -- for price appreciation are staying put.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Detroit's Garden City suburb, Faye Myers pulled her three-bedroom, two-bath house off the market this autumn after six months. The nearly 81-year-old woman, who had to shave twice the original asking price of $149,900, said the only offer she received was an "insult."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because she wants to relocate to a nearby independent living facility, she'll probably try again in the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't have to move to move; I just want to move and get away from the responsibilities, like snow blowing," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 30% of seniors are making changes in homes to remain there longer, a recognition "that I'm going to be staying put for a while," said Elinor Ginzler, AARP's senior vice president for livable communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others are opting for in-home services such as Elect Home Care, a Memphis, Tenn-based company that provides non-medical services such as laundry and errands and personal-care assistance including bathing and grooming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seems like business would be booming, but it isn't. Although Jonathan Jones, the six-year-old company's director of business development, said operations are holding steady. Family members without jobs have more time to devote to mom or dad, while his services make an obvious target for seniors looking to trim budgets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The primary way people pay for these services is out of their own pocket," he said. "Everybody's in the same boat, wondering what their savings (are) going to do, what the market value of their investments is going to be."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Empty Beds</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The uncertainty is affecting operators of retirement facilities, a largely fragmented industry that is seeing occupancy rates fall, particularly in independent living facilities where the need to move isn't as dire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Tampa, for instance, independent living facilities in the third quarter were 84.5% occupied, down from 95.6% in the first quarter of 2007, which is considered the industry's peak, according to NIC MAP, a group that tracks the fundamentals of the senior housing market in the nation's top 100 metro markets. In Riverside, Calif., occupancy was 88.1%, down from 93.6% in the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some operators are having problems filling pricier and bigger units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The larger units that traditionally used to be the first to go are now the last to go," said William T. Smith, president and CEO of Aging In America Inc., which operates the 120-apartment Hertlin House on Long Island. "Seniors are opting for the studios or the small one bedroom."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, continuing care retirement communities, which offer more health services as seniors age and typically require an entrance fee -- sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars -- as well as a monthly fee, are feeling stress. Home sales are often part of the funding to enter these facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Cameron Park, Calif., couple in their 70s is committed, but can't make the move because the golf-course ranch they've owned for 18 years didn't sell. They need to pay a $300,000 membership fee to move into a two-bedroom at the Eskaton Village Carmichael, a luxury, gated development they said has gourmet meals, a hair salon, walking trails and even a post office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple, who didn't want their name used, were on a waiting list but have turned down open units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Unless we get the money for the house, we can't" move, the wife said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bargain Rates</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, some retirement facilities are cutting rates and offering specials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After seeing its occupancy slip from 100% to 90% this year, the Hertlin House, is offering $1,000 off a month's rent for residents who bring in new tenants, who also get the deal. Its "Weather the Winter With Us" program lets seniors try out the nonprofit, independent living facility that costs between $3,000 and $4,000 per month, before inking an annual lease. In that deal, Hertlin House funds furniture rental, and the pieces can be purchased at discount if the potential resident decides to stick around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The center's waiting list includes seven seniors, some on the list for several months, hoping to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas' Oak Hill Senior Living opted to slash prices to fill its two dozen or so empty unit - its all-inclusive studios that come with three meals a day, utilities and weekly housekeeping rent for $995 a month, down from $1,295 previously. The rates have dropped "to the point where we're kind of eating costs and losing money," said Executive Director Anisa Holmes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We would probably have about 12 move-ins now if they could sell their homes," Ms. Holmes said. "They're just sitting and waiting. When they finally do, then they'll call us."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jon Hilsenrath   </div><div>1315 words</div><div>17 December 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Economy; A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve cut its target interest rate Tuesday to historic lows between zero and a quarter percentage point and said it could expand a program of unorthodox lending and securities purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After two days of discussion among Fed officials, the central bank said it would use every weapon from its arsenal to lift the U.S. from recession. It began by reducing its target interest rate -- an overnight bank-lending rate called the federal-funds rate -- from 1%. Another Fed lending rate, the discount rate, will go to half a percentage point, a level last seen in the 1940s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cut was more than many economists expected, and the statement that came with it marked the latest signal by the Fed and its chairman, Ben Bernanke, that the central bank was prepared to take aggressive steps to revive the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability," the Fed said in a statement. It added that it expected interest rates to remain "exceptionally" low for some time, a subtle commitment to the current policy that could help bring down longer-term interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In normal times, lower rates reduce the cost of borrowing for households, businesses and financial institutions, which spurs borrowing and economic activity. Those effects are being muted now, however, because many businesses and households are weighed down by heavy debts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, stocks rallied on the news of the Fed's action. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished at 8924.14, up 359.61 points, or 4.2%, on the day. Treasury bonds rallied, sending their yields lower. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes hit 2.269%. The dollar sank against the euro and the yen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of official borrowing rates -- such as rates on three-month Treasury bills -- have tumbled to near zero, a level they haven't been near since the Great Depression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President-elect Barack Obama used the Fed move as a rallying call for more fiscal stimulus, the idea of increased government spending or tax cuts, which Fed officials support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are running out of the traditional ammunition that's used in a recession, which is to lower interest rates," Mr. Obama said in a news conference. "They're getting to be about as low as they can go. And although the Fed is still going to have more tools available to it, it is critical that the other branches of government step up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble for Fed officials is that while official borrowing rates are very low, interest rates for borrowers with even a modicum of risk remain far above levels of a few months ago, which is squeezing the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond lowering interest rates, the central bank said it could expand lending programs, including a plan to buy mortgage-backed securities. The Fed also said it was studying such rescue measures as purchasing U.S. Treasury securities, which could help reduce long-term borrowing rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sixteen months into a campaign to lift the U.S. economy from a gathering financial storm, the Fed's efforts have so far failed, despite cutting interest rates more than five percentage points. In the latest example of the deepening recession, the Commerce Department said new home building dropped 19% in November, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 625,000 units, a record monthly low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Fed gets an 'A' or 'A-minus' for effort and not very good marks for results," said Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist and former Fed vice chairman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, consumer prices posted their second straight record monthly drop, with the consumer price index falling by 1.7% in November. Gasoline prices tumbled, while car dealers, retailers and others stepped up their discounting to move goods and sell services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign that inflation is decelerating sharply, core consumer prices, which exclude volatile food and energy prices, were unchanged in November. In the past three months, they have risen at an annual rate of just 0.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price declines have helped many consumers in the short run, but a longer-run bout of falling consumer prices could be dangerous, giving households even more incentive to slow spending and hoard cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Persistently falling prices also raise the real cost of borrowing for businesses and households, and thus Fed officials are determined to try to avoid it. A senior Fed official said after the meeting that the central bank isn't now worried about deflation, but expects the inflation rate to decelerate further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials spent much of two days of meetings deliberating over what other rescue steps the central bank could take as interest rates approach zero. Mr. Bernanke spent much of his academic career studying that and other questions related to financial crises, and the Fed is now employing almost every prescription he laid out in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The approach carries several risks. It could eventually lead to the opposite of the current problem: higher inflation. It also exposes the independent central bank to political meddling and to losses on loans. Then there's the risk that it won't work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed has already started a campaign to lend directly to damaged financial markets and companies -- nearly anyone with collateral. Its statement Tuesday said those efforts could "sustain the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a high level."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By such lending, officials have effectively concluded that if banks and financial markets won't extend credit, it will do part of the job for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two large Fed programs are still being ramped up. In one, the central bank has said it will buy as much as $600 billion of debt issued or guaranteed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and other government-backed mortgage businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the Fed has only committed $8 billion to those purchases. Officials were relieved that mortgage rates have fallen since announcing the program last month. Rates on a conforming 30-year mortgages have dropped to 5.28% from 6.64% since the Fed's last meeting, according to HSH Associates, a financial publishing firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates have been one of the few areas in financial markets where credit costs have fallen in the past few weeks. In its statement, the Fed said it stood ready to expand the program "as conditions warrant."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials are focused on reducing other rates relative to Treasury benchmarks, a difference known on Wall Street as a spread. Across a wide range of lending, spreads have remained painfully high since September, a sign of tight credit conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One closely followed spread is the difference between interbank lending rates over three months and the expected federal-funds rate. A growing spread indicates a higher cost of borrowing. That spread has come down from more than three percentage points in early October to about 1.5 percentage points, but it remains well above levels that prevailed earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other spreads have continued to march higher. For instance, 'BB'-rated junk bonds now trade at more than 14 percentage points above comparable Treasury bonds -- a crushing borrowing cost for many low-rated companies -- compared with a spread of less than six percentage points before September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed officials have high expectations for another program through which they will lend as much as $200 billion against highly rated asset-backed securities backed by car loans, student loans, credit-card debt and small-business loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. officials have said the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility is expected to begin operating in February and can be expanded to other asset classes, including commercial real estate loans or mortgages not backed by Fannie and Freddie.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IRS officials say they are speeding up efforts to provide relief for homeowners in financial distress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Internal Revenue Service has developed an "expedited process" to make it easier for homeowners to refinance their mortgages or sell their homes without having a federal tax lien delay or even block the process, officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman said he isn't in a position to predict how many families will benefit. He did say there are more than one million federal tax liens outstanding tied to real estate and personal property. The IRS issues more than 600,000 federal tax lien notices a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the IRS files a lien on someone's property, it's in effect making a formal claim to that property as security or payment for a tax debt. The lien also tells other creditors that the government has a claim on the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These are difficult times for the U.S. economy," said Mr. Shulman. "Many homeowners are at risk of losing their homes. Many are hoping to refinance at lower rates, and in some cases, homeowners are forced to sell their homes and get the best deal they can in the current marketplace."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, he says, IRS officials will respond more quickly to taxpayer requests to clear away liens and allow homeowners to proceed with refinancings or home sales. In the past, the process usually has taken about 30 days after a completed application is filed, a spokesman said. Officials didn't say how much more quickly they will respond, but they did say they are increasing staffing, as necessary, to speed up the processing time and the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't want the IRS to be a barrier to people saving or selling their homes," Mr. Shulman said. "We want to raise awareness of these lien options and to speed our decision-making process so people can refinance their mortgages or sell their homes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Linda Goold, tax counsel for the National Association of Realtors, calls the IRS move "very helpful." She says "anything that clears any impediment to a transaction is a boon. We view that as a great positive." The national median existing-home price for all types of housing fell to $183,300 in October, according to the Realtors group. That was down about 11% from a year earlier, when the median price was $206,700.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're trying to refinance or sell a home with a lien attached to it, you have several options. You or a representative, such as a lender, can ask the IRS to make its lien secondary to the claim of the lender that's refinancing or restructuring the loan, the IRS said. Another option: If you're selling your home for less than the amount of the mortgage lien on that home, you can ask the IRS to "discharge" its claim on it. That doesn't erase your tax debt. It just clears that home from the lien so that the home can be sold, or the debt refinanced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Very few people seem to be aware that these options exist. IRS officials say they get relatively few requests each year to discharge liens or to make them secondary to another lien, such as a lending institution's, in a process known as "subordination."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* * *</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More states are offering tax amnesties or similar programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a typical amnesty, the state agrees not to prosecute or impose penalties on those who step forward voluntarily, before officials knock on their door, and pay what they owe or make arrangements to pay. Many states go even further by offering reduced interest charges, or no interest at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connecticut hopes to raise about $40 million through an amnesty from May 1 through June 25, 2009, says Sarah Kaufman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Revenue Services in Hartford. The state won't impose penalties and is offering a reduced interest rate. "You're going to see more deals like this in the coming year as legislative sessions open in 2009" and lawmakers look for ways to raise cash quickly, says Verenda Smith of the Federation of Tax Administrators in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, the state tax department launched a new "voluntary disclosure" plan last summer that officials say already has been highly successful. It offers protection from criminal and civil penalties to all eligible taxpayers who voluntarily disclose and "correct" their "delinquent tax liabilities," and who agree to obey the law in the future. To participate, you have to come in voluntarily before the department finds you. Unlike traditional amnesties, New York's offer doesn't have an end date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, New York's tax department has received nearly 1,000 applicants, says William Comiskey, deputy commissioner for tax enforcement. Of those, about 45% reported owing a total of more than $12 million. "The other 55% will tell us what they owe when they sign their agreements and send their returns," he says. Mr. Comiskey estimates that those 1,000 applicants will be reporting "somewhere around $25 million when all the numbers are in," and calls the results "pretty spectacular."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Securing voluntary compliance is our primary enforcement objective," Mr. Comiskey says. The program is "the honey intended to entice taxpayers to self-correct past delinquencies and become compliant in the future."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael Corkery, Craig Karmin, Rhonda L. Rundle and Joann S. Lublin </div><div>2398 words</div><div>17 December 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the height of the property bubble, California's giant pension fund, Calpers, made a fateful decision: It aggressively poured money into real estate. As a result, today it's one of the biggest owners of undeveloped residential land in America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Partly because of these investments, <span class="companylink">California Public Employees' Retirement System</span> is struggling to avoid one of its worst annual declines since its 1932 inception. Calpers has lost almost a quarter of its assets since July 1, the start of the current fiscal year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problems come at a time of uncertainty for the nation's largest public pension fund, which has been without its top two executives for nearly half a year. Calpers is poised to appoint a new chief executive as early as this week, people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calpers is now warning California's cities, towns and schools that they may have to cough up more money to cover the retirement and other benefits the fund provides for 1.6 million state workers. Some towns are already cutting municipal services, and at least one is partly blaming the Calpers fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calpers in recent weeks said it expects to report paper losses of 103% on its housing investments in the fiscal year ended June 30. That's because Calpers invested not only its own money, but billions of dollars of borrowed money that must be repaid even if the investment fails. In some deals, as much as 80% of the money invested by Calpers was borrowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest wrinkle: To generate sorely needed cash, a troubled Calpers venture known as LandSource recently started the process of selling land during the worst property market in a generation. Calpers could potentially lose nearly $1 billion on LandSource, a $2.5 billion deal completed early last year, and one of the priciest U.S. residential-land transactions ever. LandSource is now under bankruptcy-court protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With $239 billion in assets as of June, Calpers's portfolio was bigger than the government-run funds of Russia, South Korea, Dubai and Chile combined. In recent years, Calpers became much more aggressive than other pension funds in making nontraditional investments -- real estate, foreign stocks, even forestland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless Calpers's returns bounce back by June, the fund says it expects that the rates it charges governments to participate in the pension could rise starting in 2010, leaving them with less money to spend on other services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alicia Munnell of the Center for Retirement Research, Boston College, says the economic slump will likely force other pension funds besides Calpers to pass on the financial pain. "Even under the best-case scenario...taxpayers are still going to have to put more money into pension funds."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calpers points out that its commercial properties, including a chunk of <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> Center in New York, haven't been nearly as hard-hit as residential investments, which are valued at about $6 billion. Together, residential and commercial holdings total about one-tenth of the fund's overall $182.6 billion portfolio. Its real-estate portfolio fell 14.4% for the 12 months ended in September, underperforming its benchmark, which rose 5.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calpers stresses that it's a long-term investor and can earn back the declines in the future, just as it erased declines suffered in the dot-com bust a few years ago. "No one in the marketplace knew how swiftly the housing market would fall -- not the Federal Reserve, not the Treasury," said Ted Eliopoulos, head of Calpers's real-estate portfolio, in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund has also added "checks and balances" on property-investment decisions, Mr. Eliopoulos said. "Calpers has always attempted to learn from downturns," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The details of Calpers's housing deals, and the identities of some of the home builders it invested with, are only starting to come to light. That's because investments were often made through ventures with opaque names like "Hearthstone Path of Growth Fund," and Calpers doesn't detail many of their holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calpers says its investments were done with "customary oversight" and were "appropriate for the asset class and typical the industry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years Calpers invested in:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three large parcels near Phoenix, one of the nation's hardest-hit property markets. Last month, Calpers effectively walked away from one of the three, after having invested $140 million. On one of the others, to start earning a return, Calpers's investment partner recently started selling ground water from the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A massive block of land with room for about 8,000 units near the small town of Mountain House, Calif., the nation's most "underwater" housing market by one measure. (Nearly 90% of homeowners there owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, according to mortgage-research firm FirstAmerican Corelogic.) As of June 30, Calpers valued the investment at negative $305 million, reflecting the fact that it has repaid borrowed money used in the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 10,000 acres near Jacksonville, Fla. The plan was to sell timber from the property, as well as residential lots. But as real estate collapses, it could take five years before the venture can start selling lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just one particularly bad year for investments can have serious consequences for California governments in the retirement system. Calpers recently estimated that if its declines for the current fiscal year are greater than 20%, it would trigger an increase of 2% to 5% of an employer's payroll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, the average employer-contribution rate for public agencies, including cities and counties, is 13% of payroll, Calpers said, which is already on the high side for state pension funds, according to industry analysts. A 5% increase in California's rate would be the largest increase to hit public employers since the dot-com bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any rate increases aren't a certainty, Calpers says, since the fund could still earn back its declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate losses aren't the primary reason Calpers is taking a hit. Its biggest declines have been in the stock market: Its stock portfolio is down 41% so far this fiscal year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Calpers has targeted less money in bonds, and about double the allocation to private-equity investments and real-estate deals, than the average public pension fund, according to Calpers documents and an industry survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calpers got more aggressive in real estate amid the tech-stock selloff of 2000-02. Its board decided to increase its investments in real estate and private equity, shifting some money out of safer, but lower-yielding, holdings like bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Carlson, a former Calpers board member who left the board earlier this year, said publicly at that time, "We believe taking no risk is the biggest risk you can take."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Land purchases are among the riskiest real-estate investments. Not only can property values swing wildly, but unlike, say, a stock, land can take months or years to sell. Amplifying the risk, many of Calpers's land investments used borrowed money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investing borrowed money acts as a lever: In a rising market, it lifts overall returns since you're profiting not only on your own capital, but the borrowed money too. But in a falling market, that leverage amplifies losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help it identify promising real-estate investments, Calpers turned to a small circle of partners it had previously done deals with since 1992, albeit on a much smaller scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The early investments had worked very well," says Barry Gross, president of Developers Research, an Irvine, Calif., advisory firm that had consulted on several earlier and smaller Calpers land investments. "Calpers said, 'If we can do it with 300 houses, let's do it with 3,000.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael McCook, then head of Calpers's real-estate investments, proposed boosting returns by investing more borrowed money. "I told them it would help in the good times, and it would hurt in the bad times," Mr. McCook recalls telling the board in 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investing borrowed money is common in land-buying partnerships. Mr. McCook says he felt Calpers would be at a disadvantage when vying for a piece of these deals if it were unwilling to boost returns in a similar way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calpers already used borrowed money in commercial-property deals. Between 2001 and 2002, it raised the amount permitted to an average 50% from 25%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In residential-property deals, traditionally Calpers hadn't used much borrowed money. But in 2005, the trustees sanctioned use of borrowed money in residential deals at an average rate of 60%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the average rate applies to Calpers's entire housing portfolio, some individual deals used as much as 80% borrowed money, Mr. McCook recalls. That level is more aggressive than many pension funds or land developers would use, industry consultants and developers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calpers says that other public pension funds have invested borrowed money at the same level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increased use of borrowed money corresponded with the peaking property market. In 2004 and 2005, housing prices were jumping as much as 30% a year in some places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until last year, the Calpers strategy worked. Through its housing partners, the fund pursued big, complex deals with large home builders. Returns on housing investments were an impressive 16% average annually from 2004 through 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a typical deal, Calpers would provide the funding to its partners, who would team up with a home builder to buy land. Most of the equity would come from Calpers, while the home builder would put down 10% to 15%, in exchange for the right to eventually buy the land in full.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders like to do this because it lets them essentially control land without having it weigh down their balance sheets. And Calpers hoped for big returns by selling that land to the builders in a booming market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calpers's investment partners worked with major home builders including <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Beazer Homes USA</span>, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the property market soured, deals that once looked smart revealed a dark side, because Calpers agreed to terms that exposed it to more of the risk in bad times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, Calpers guaranteed $1.7 billion in debt across several deals. Typically, home-builders are the guarantors -- that is, they're on the hook in the event of a default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By being guarantor, Calpers used its rock-solid reputation to obtain lower borrowing costs. But today, as projects struggle, the guarantees mean Calpers is pouring additional cash into projects from which it might otherwise prefer to walk away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the U.S. property market crested, the deals got bigger. The biggest was LandSource, the $2.5 billion venture now in bankruptcy-court protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In LandSource, Calpers teamed up with <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., the giant Miami-based home builder. Lennar was known in the industry for its sophisticated use of land deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The LandSource deal took shape in 2006, when Victor MacFarlane, one of Calpers's long-time real-estate investors, asked Lennar if it would be interested in selling a big stake in its 15,000-acre Newhall Ranch, north of Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newhall Ranch's co-owners, Lennar and <span class="companylink">LNR Property Corp</span>., a unit of Cerberus Capital, were willing to sell. Around the same time, Lennar's CEO, Stuart Miller, was warning that the weak housing market could worsen. Discussing land purchases in a September 2006 conference call, Mr. Miller said: "Right now there's no evidence of opportunities to jump in and buy something strategic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The LandSource deal involved $970 million from a Calpers-funded venture, along with $1.5 billion in borrowed money. Lennar and LNR each received $707 million in cash and each retain a 16% stake. The Calpers-venture, which was co-managed by Mr. MacFarlane's firm and Weyerhaeuser Realty Investors, a unit of the giant timber company, took a 68% stake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. MacFarlane, the man proposing the deal, was highly regarded among Calpers top brass. "Victor MacFarlane was well-known and liked by board members and the CEO," says Russell Read, then Calpers's chief investment officer, who stepped down in June and now heads C Change Investments, which invests in companies that promote new technologies for protecting the environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Read takes responsibility for giving LandSource the go-ahead at Calpers. "We based it on our research, our judgment and on MacFarlane's track record," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turned out to be a bad moment to buy land. In the summer of 2007, just a few months after LandSource closed, the U.S. housing market entered its historic free-fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LandSource filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. MacFarlane declined to comment. Previously, he has said he knew the market was in decline but viewed LandSource as a long-term investment that would pay off over a decade or more. A Calpers spokeswoman said in recent days, "We are monitoring [LandSource] in the bankruptcy process and protecting our interest." A lawyer for LandSource says the venture is planning to sell smaller parcels, but preserve the large Newhall Ranch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid the losses, Calpers is making some changes in its investment-decision process. In February 2007, shortly after Mr. Eliopoulos became head of Calpers' real-estate group, the fund set a new policy requiring deals to be vetted three times -- by the internal investment committee, an independent fiduciary and, finally, by an outside consultant. Previously, much of the oversight came from Calpers' staff and consultants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calpers is creating a new computer database to more closely track "balance and diversification" in the real-estate portfolio. It also is proposing to reduce the maximum amount of borrowed money that can be used in housing deals, and cut back on loan guarantees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Diehr, vice-president of Calpers' board, said that in the future the fund will have less of its money invested in residential property, although that's partly because its current holdings have fallen in value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Certainly, there remains a possibility that additional properties will be sold," he said. "We're doing the analysis now."</p>

</div><div class="author">By R. Glenn Hubbard  and Christopher J. Mayer </div><div>1071 words</div><div>17 December 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Opinion; A21</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent news articles suggest that the Treasury Department is considering a plan to offer a 4.5% mortgage for home buyers for a period of time. Let's hope it does. It would help arrest the decline in house prices that is at the base of the ongoing financial crisis and recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raising the demand for housing makes sense now. While fundamental factors clearly played a role in driving down house prices that were at excessive levels two years ago, we have argued in a paper (to be published in the Berkeley Electronic Journal of Economic Analysis and Policy) that in most markets house values are today lower than what is consistent with the average level of affordability in the past 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, without policy action house prices are likely to continue falling, thanks largely to the meltdown in mortgage markets and the weakening employment outlook. Conversely, we see little risk that increasing the demand for housing will touch off another housing bubble. And indexing the mortgage rate to the Treasury yield could avoid this outcome in the future. While the economy is contracting, low interest rates would spur housing activity. When economic activity improves, the U.S. Treasury yield and mortgage rates would rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 4.5% mortgage rate is not too low. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield closed at 2.3% on Dec. 12, 2008. Hence a 4.5% mortgage rate is 2.2% above the Treasury yield, above the 1.6% spread that would prevail in a normally functioning mortgage market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some have argued that lenders should earn more than the average 1.6% spread, to compensate for the fact that housing is a much riskier investment today. We don't think so. Recall that a mortgage can be thought of as a risk-free bond plus two possibilities that increase risk to lenders: default and/or prepayment. Historically, the risk of default adds about 0.25% to the interest rate. The remaining spread of the mortgage rate over the Treasury yield represents the risk of prepayment and underwriting costs. With falling house prices, the risk of default could indeed add 0.75% or more for a newly underwritten and fully documented loan. But 4.5% would be the lowest mortgage rate in more than 30 years -- so the additional risk to lenders of prepayment would be almost nil. And low mortgage rates would substantially reduce the risk of further house price declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, a 4.5% mortgage rate will raise housing demand significantly. A simple forecast can be obtained by applying the 2003-2004 homeownership rates to 2007 households. We use the 2003-2004 home ownership rates because those were the years of the lowest previous mortgage rates (the average mortgage rate was 5.8%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An increase in the homeownership rate from 67.9 (third quarter, 2008) to 68.6 (the average rate from 2003-2004) would increase homeownership by about 800,000 new homeowners. If we also take into account the changing relative age distribution of the population, there would be a total of 1.6 million new homeowners. A simple statistical analysis examining the impact of lower mortgage rates and higher unemployment rates yields an even higher, and firmer, estimate of 2.4 million additional owner occupied homes in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increased demand for housing arising from lower mortgage rates would provide a floor on further house price declines. Estimates in our recent paper suggest that real house prices increase by about 75% of the decline in after-tax mortgage payments. So a decline in mortgage payments of 16% would result in approximately a 12% floor on the decline in house prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Current futures markets suggest that house prices will decline by 12%-18% in the next 18 months. So a 4.5% interest rate might well lead to flat or even slightly higher house prices in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stabilizing house prices will likely improve consumer confidence substantially. Increases in house prices relative to where they would have gone with higher mortgage rates would also provide a housing wealth effect -- that is, higher annual increases in spending as consumers feel richer -- on consumption of as much as $76 billion to $113 billion each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 4.5% mortgage rate that the Treasury is considering also should be available for present homeowners who want to refinance, because of the benefits for the economy as a whole. We calculate that up to 34 million households would be able to do so, at an average monthly savings of $428 -- or a total reduction in mortgage payments of $174 billion. This is a permanent reduction in payments and is thus likely to spur appreciable increases in consumption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, trillions of dollars of refinancings would retire a large number of the existing mortgage-backed securities. This would reduce uncertainty about the value of existing mortgage-backed securities. It would flood the market with additional liquidity that the private sector could deploy to other uses such as auto loans, credit cards, commercial mortgages and general business lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reduction of mortgage interest rates to 4.5% (or, given yesterday's Fed action, to a lower level) is superior to other proposals that focus only on stopping foreclosures, or on reforming the bankruptcy code to keep people in their homes. Stopping foreclosures, however meritorious, may not limit the dangerous decline in house prices as much as proponents claim. It could work the other way. Stripping down mortgage balances in bankruptcy would likely raise future mortgage interest rates and lower the availability of mortgages, reducing house prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, a decrease in the mortgage rate, even though it is intended be a temporary intervention in the present exigency, plants a seed for future thought. Given the chaos of the recent past, wouldn't a return to simple, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with a low rate be the right foundation for the long-term future?</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. Federal Reserve officials slashed official interest rates to a historic low range to combat a deepening recession and signaled they will keep rates "exceptionally low" for some time amid rapidly waning price pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials Tuesday also signaled a new phase for policy in which lending programs financed by the Fed's ballooning balance sheet, a process known as quantitative easing, replace the federal-funds rate as the Fed's primary policy tool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Open Market Committee voted unanimously to reduce the target fed-funds rate for interbank lending from 1% to a range of zero to 0.25%, the lowest since the Fed started publishing the funds target in 1990. The market-determined effective fed-funds rate already has already hit record lows in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had expected a smaller cut of 0.5 percentage point, and hadn't envisioned the Fed setting a range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Committee anticipates that weak economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time," the Fed said, adding it will "employ all available tools" to promote growth and maintain price stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed has used a variety of operating targets through the decades, including the discount rate and monetary aggregates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed also lowered the discount rate paid by commercial and investment banks for Fed loans by 0.75 percentage point to 0.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, the FOMC said its focus "will be to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that sustain the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a high level."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ben Bernanke tipped the shift toward quantitative easing -- in which cash is essentially created and used to finance lending facilities -- earlier this month. He said that while the Fed's ability to use interest rates to support the economy "is obviously limited" with rates so low, the "second arrow in the Federal Reserve's quiver -- the provision of liquidity -- remains effective."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even President-elect Barack Obama on Tuesday said "we are running out of the traditional ammunition that's used in a recession, which is to lower interest rates, they're getting to be about as low as they can go."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed already has nontraditional initiatives in place to support lending to commercial and investment banks, provide U.S. dollar funding overseas and stabilize commercial paper and money market mutual funds. The Fed recently started purchasing agency debt and has announced plans to purchase hundreds of billions of dollars of agency-backed mortgage backed securities and consumer-linked asset backed securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Tuesday's statement, the Fed also said it is "evaluating the potential benefits of purchasing longer-term Treasury securities."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When loans to <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> and <span class="companylink">American International Group</span> are included, the Fed's balance sheet now tops $2.2 trillion, more than double where it was when <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> collapsed in mid September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the drumbeat of economic news worsened considerably between the late October and December FOMC meetings, highlighting the need for more stimulus. Consumer spending got off to a horrible start in the fourth quarter, and the economy lost more than 500,000 jobs in November alone, a total that could be matched or exceeded this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Dec. 1 the National Bureau of Economic Research, the semiofficial arbiter of recession, declared that the U.S. has been in a recession since last December. And it appears to be getting worse. Wall Street economists expect U.S. gross domestic product to plunge as much as 6% at an annual rate or even more this quarter. Some are penciling in another steep drop for the first quarter of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The outlook for economic activity has weakened further," the Fed said, noting weak labor markets and declining consumer spending, production and investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That weakness, coupled with a steep declines in energy prices, has not only brought inflation rates down sharply but also fanned some fears of outright deflation -- which is a sustained, economywide decline in prices that cripples consumer and business spending. In its worst form, deflation is associated with Japan's deep recession earlier this decade as well as the Great Depression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to November consumer price data released Tuesday, annual U.S. inflation is now running just 1.1%, matching its lowest rate since 1965. If December data come in soft as expected, the annual rate could approach zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consumer-price index dropped 1.7% in November on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Labor Department said, the largest drop since the government started compiling the figures in 1947 and beyond the 1.3% decline Wall Street economists had expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The core CPI, which excludes energy and food, was unchanged last month following October's decline, the first in more than 25 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, home construction took its biggest tumble in 24 years during November, falling to a record low, while a sign of future building also dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 18.9% to a seasonally adjusted 625,000 annual rate compared with the prior month, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Building permits, a sign of future construction, fell 15.6% to a record-low 616,000 annual rate in November.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. consumer prices posted a second straight record decline in November, a government report showed Tuesday, suggesting that tumbling energy prices and the slumping economy are rapidly taking pressure off inflation and could lead to sustained price drops known as deflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures, which included a steep drop in the annual inflation rate to match four-decade lows, suggested that the Federal Reserve would slash official interest rates at the conclusion of its two-day meeting later Tuesday to prevent a self-feeding spiral of lower prices and falling spending and investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, home construction took its biggest tumble in 24 years during November, falling to a record low, while a sign of future building also dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consumer-price index dropped 1.7% last month on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Labor Department said, the largest drop since the government started compiling the figures in 1947 and beyond the 1.3% decline Wall Street economists had expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The core CPI, which excludes energy and food, was unchanged last month following October's decline, the first in more than 25 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price data reflect the hard economic times that are causing consumers and businesses to delay purchases. In its worst form, that scenario is known as deflation, which was blamed for Japan's deep economic slump earlier this decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Against that backdrop, and with the economy in a recession, financial markets expected the Fed to lower official interest rates by half a percentage point to 0.5% at the conclusion of Tuesday's meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer prices rose 1.1% on a year-over-year basis in November, which is below the Fed's 1.5% to 2% target range. That matched the lowest reading since February 1965 and marked a sharp reversal since July, when the year-over-year rate reached 5.6%. The core CPI, however, was up 2% from last year, suggesting the U.S. isn't yet at serious risk of deflation across the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 18.9% to a seasonally adjusted 625,000 annual rate compared with the prior month, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Building permits, a sign of future construction, fell 15.6% to a record-low 616,000 annual rate in November.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tightened lending standards are leaving builders and real-estate agents scrambling for new ways to move cash-strapped buyers into homes. One increasingly popular option: an obscure home-loan program offered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Created in 1991 as a way to boost homeownership in rural areas, the program is being tapped by home buyers in overbuilt exurbs who are attracted to the no-money-down terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Erick Moore first read about the USDA's Rural Development Guaranteed Loan program, he says he imagined it would be "restricted to some little farmhouse." Instead, the 33-year-old computer programmer moved last month into a four-bedroom, three-bath home in Fuquay-Varina, N.C., 17 miles outside Raleigh. The house sits on nearly one acre and features a brick facade, 10-foot ceilings and hardwood floors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I couldn't believe it until we closed," says Mr. Moore, who paid only $1,200 out of pocket to move into the $228,000 home. The seller contributed $5,000 in closing costs, and Mr. Moore rolled the 2% fee charged by the USDA into the loan. Mr. Moore, who owned a home in St. Louis before he relocated to the Raleigh area last year, says a 60% drop in his stock portfolio made it difficult to come up with a down payment. He directed his Realtor to show him only homes that were eligible for the USDA program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fueled by buyers like Mr. Moore, volume has nearly doubled for these USDA-backed loans. The department insured $7 billion in loans during the 2008 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, up from $3.6 billion the previous year. In October and November, the agency has already insured some $1.7 billion in loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's relatively small when compared with the volume of business handled by the Federal Housing Administration -- which guaranteed $102 billion in new loans during fiscal 2008. But interest in the USDA's development lending program is growing rapidly in response to the nation's credit crunch and as most private lenders have stopped offering loans with no money down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be eligible for a USDA-backed loan, a borrower can't have income that exceeds 115% of the median county income, and the loans are restricted to areas with lower population density -- generally towns of no more than 25,000 residents. So while home buyers in big cities aren't eligible for the loans, residents of many of America's fastest-growing towns and exurbs do qualify. The loans that come through the program are made by private lenders, then insured by the government and sold to Ginnie Mae, a federal agency that sells mortgages to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders, many of which have overbuilt properties in these areas, are eagerly promoting the program to sell excess inventory. The USDA program accounted for 40%-50% of sales in October and November for Scottsdale, Ariz.-based home builder <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes</span>, says John Bargnesi, vice president for sales. "It's one of our main tools right now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders Promote Program</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meritage is advertising a "$500 move in" program to clear inventory in new exurban developments, including the Buckeye and Queen Creek subdivisions outside Phoenix that have been hard hit by foreclosures and falling prices. "If a builder is in one of these geographical areas, they certainly are using it," says Mr. Bargnesi. "We're all in tune with it now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>., the nation's largest home builder by number of houses built, is promoting the program in sales pitches for a number of new developments outside Austin, Texas. One is named Parkside Condos, a development of 144 new two- and three-bedroom condos priced at $130,000 in Pflugerville. Kastera Homes LLC, a home builder based in Boise, Idaho, is offering to pay closing costs for buyers who use a USDA loan. <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> and Kastera didn't return calls seeking comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The success of the USDA program comes at a time when easy home financing is getting much harder to find. Private lenders have stopped offering loans that require no money down, amid worries that borrowers without equity are more likely to let their homes fall into foreclosure. In October, Congress terminated a popular program that allowed sellers to fund down-payment "gifts" for new home loans backed by the FHA. Next year, the FHA will require a minimum 3.5% down payment on all new loans, up from 3%, and private lenders often require a minimum 5% down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such restrictions do not apply to loans backed by the USDA, which is best known as the guardian of the nation's food supply. In fact, some buyers can finance 102% of the home price, factoring in a 2% USDA insurance fee meant to cover loan losses. The loans also don't require borrowers to pay for monthly mortgage insurance. That means that USDA loans typically carry lower monthly payments than FHA loans, even in cases when the size of the loan is larger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sue Botelho of Northstar Mortgage Group in Destin, Fla., is promoting the USDA loans as part of a "move in with a penny down" program. "The down-payment assistance has gone away. Subprime has gone away," she says. "So now mortgage lenders are pretty aggressive in terms of making people aware of this USDA program."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Ms. Botelho's clients, 46-year-old insurance adjustor Alan Sammons, paid nothing to move into a new $270,000 home in the Florida Panhandle in June. He had spent more than a year trying to find a reasonable loan before beginning construction on a custom four-bedroom, 3½-bathroom home in his Crestview, Fla., subdivision, which includes a community swimming pool and lighted tennis courts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're still building homes in here," Mr. Sammons says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julie Chapman, a Brunswick, Ga., real-estate agent, says she is listing more properties eligible for the USDA loans -- including homes in the Plantation at Golden Isles, a new subdivision adjacent to a golf course. Many of the properties are selling preconstruction. "That's something you don't see anymore in this market," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New housing developments built on open land that were among the first to experience the downturn could now benefit from the USDA program. "They're showing some signs of recovering," says Michael Orr, a housing analyst based in Mesa, Ariz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some question the USDA's practice of allowing no-money-down purchases. "If you have to get a 102% loan, you probably shouldn't be buying a house," says U.S. Sen. Christopher Bond (R., Mo.), who adds that he supports the intent of the programs because it has traditionally been "very difficult" for rural borrowers to buy homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">USDA officials, for their part, say that concerns about the program's 100% financing aren't warranted because the department has a strong track record and because rural areas are less prone to big increases in home prices. "We guarantee in a very controlled environment," says Philip Stetson, a USDA administrator for the lending program. Because its average loan amount is just $120,000, he says that the program is less susceptible to large-scale losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Income Verification</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">USDA- and FHA-backed loans aren't prone to some of the risks that faced subprime loans because the government-insurance programs offer only fixed loans and require income verification. "We have not seen any direct evidence at this point that 100% financing is leading to greater losses," Mr. Stetson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The default rate on USDA loans is slightly better than the rate for FHA-backed loans. Some 11.35% of USDA loans were delinquent in 2008, while 1.4% went into foreclosure, according to the department's statistics. Meanwhile, FHA loans had a 13.6% delinquency rate, while 2.3% went into foreclosure. That compares to a 4.3% delinquency rate and 1.6% foreclosure rate on prime loans, and a 20.0% delinquency rate and 12.9% foreclosure rate on subprime loans, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the FHA, the USDA programs rely on a fixed appropriation from Congress, which totaled $4.1 billion in the 2008 fiscal year, and new loans can't be made once that allocation is exhausted. The program was able to make nearly $7 billion in loans this year because it received additional funding from other department sources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But heavy demand for the loans has administrators asking for more money. Officials say that the program will run out of money next month, even though it has been funded through March. "Up until only two years ago, we weren't even using the full amount," says Mr. Stetson. "It has been rather incredible at how it has taken off."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. consumer prices posted a second-straight record decline last month, a government report showed, suggesting that tumbling energy prices and the slumping economy are rapidly taking pressure off inflation and could even lead to sustained price drops known as deflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, home construction took its biggest tumble in 24 years during November, falling to a record low, while a sign of future building also plummeted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consumer price index dropped 1.7% last month on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Labor Department said Tuesday, the largest drop since the government started compiling the figures in 1947 and well in excess of the 1.3% decline Wall Street economists had expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The core CPI was unchanged last month following October's decline, which was the first in more than 25 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unrounded, the CPI fell by 1.684% last month, the fourth drop in a row. The core CPI rose 0.022% unrounded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's CPI data follow record declines in import and producer prices for November. Those figures were released last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Normally, such signs of rapid price drops would be hailed as a welcome reprieve for households that saw their purchasing power crippled earlier in the year by soaring energy and food prices. But in the current climate, the inflation data reflect the hard economic times that are causing consumers and businesses to delay purchases. In its worst form, that process is known as deflation, which was blamed for Japan's deep economic slump earlier this decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Against that backdrop, and with the economy in a deep recession, financial markets expect the Fed to lower official interest rates by at least one-half percentage point to just 0.5% at the conclusion of Tuesday's meeting. The decision is expected around 2:15 p.m. EST.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer prices rose 1.1% on a year-over-year basis in November, which is below the Fed's 1.5% to 2% target range. Last month's annual rate matched the lowest reading since February 1965 and marks a stunning reversal since July, when the year-over-year rate reached 5.6%. The core CPI, however, was up 2% from last year, suggesting the U.S. isn't yet at serious risk of economy-wide deflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy prices plunged 17% in November compared to October. Gasoline prices plummeted a record 29.5%. Food prices, in contrast, climbed 0.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transportation prices fell a record 9.8% as airline fares dropped 4% and new vehicle prices fell by 0.6%, reflecting the severe slump in auto sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing, which accounts for 40% of the CPI index, fell 0.1%, the third decline in four months. Rent increased 0.2%. Owners' equivalent rent advanced 0.3%. However household fuels and utilities prices tumbled 1.6% while lodging away from home fell a second-straight month, by 1.1%, which could reflect the slumping economy that's keeping more households from vacationing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Medical care prices increased 0.2%, while clothing prices rose 0.3%, though that only reversed a portion of the previous month's 1% decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Labor Department said the average weekly earnings of U.S. workers, adjusted for inflation, climbed 2.3% November as higher wages and falling prices offset a decline in hours worked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing Starts Decline</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts decreased 18.9% to a seasonally adjusted 625,000 annual rate compared to the prior month, after dropping 6.4% in October to 771,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Originally, Commerce reported October starts fell 4.5% to 791,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The November decrease was much bigger than Wall Street expected. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires forecast a 5.2% drop to an annual rate of 750,000. The 18.9% drop was the sharpest since 26.4% in March 1984 and carried housing starts to a record low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year over year, housing starts were 47.0% below the level of construction in November 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financing for construction is becoming harder to secure. Also, builders are restrained by plunging sales. The latest government data, issued about three weeks ago, showed new-home sales dropped 5.3% to 433,000 in October. Year over year, sales were 40.1% lower. Sales are dropping because prices are tumbling. High inventory of unsold homes are depressing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Home Builders released results Monday of a monthly survey of builders' thoughts on market prospects. Its latest, December index for sales of new, single-family homes held steady at a record low 9. "The December results confirmed the horrible news reported in November and point to continued declines in single-family housing starts," MFR Inc. analyst Joshua Shapiro said in reaction to the NAHB report. "It is going to be a very cold winter indeed for homebuilders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's data on starts showed building permits decreased 15.6% to a record-low 616,000 annual rate in November. Economists had expected permits down 4.1% to a rate of 700,000. October permits tumbled 9.3% to 730,000. Permits are a sign of future construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November single-family housing starts decreased 16.9% to 441,000. Construction of housing with two or more units fell 23.3% to 184,000; within that category, groundbreakings of homes with five or more units -- or multi-family -- were 26.9% lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, housing starts plunged 34.6% in the Northeast, 16.8% in the West, 15.6% in the South, and 23.1% in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, an estimated 44,600 houses were actually started in November, based on figures not seasonally adjusted. An estimated 40,200 building permits were issued last month, also based on unadjusted figures.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Buy New or Remodel? Is it better to renovate and refinance at a lower rate, or trade up for a larger home that would cost $50 more per month? Our columnist does the math.</span>
</div><div class="author">By June Fletcher </div><div>783 words</div><div>12 December 2008</div><div>16:28</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. My husband and I are trying to decide if we should buy a $330,000 home in our neighborhood that, at 2,300 square feet, is twice the size of our current home (the monthly payment would be only about $50 more a month than our current payment), or renovate our old house using a home equity line of credit, then refinance at a lower rate and pay off the equity line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The extra money we would need for the larger home's down payment would be around $25,000, and the renovation we'd like to do would cost the same. The renovation would up our square footage by 750 square feet and allow us to stay in our home for longer. We bought the home for $280,000 three years ago and have a private buyer who will give us what we paid for the home. Do you have any advice on whether buying new or renovating is wiser?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The decision to buy new or remodel depends on a number of factors, some financial and some not -- and ultimately, only you can decide what answer makes the most sense for you. That said, I'm leaning towards the new purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's look at some of the issues to consider:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cost per square foot: Although figuring the cost per square foot is an imperfect exercise at best, since it doesn't account for variations in floor plans and materials, it's worth doing the math (price divided by square footage). The bigger house is less expensive at $143.47 per square foot, versus $147.36 per square foot for the smaller one (after it's been expanded to 1,900 square feet).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transaction and moving costs: You need to compare the costs of refinancing -- and perhaps renting a place to stay while the remodeling takes place -- versus the costs of buying new and moving. An online calculator can help you compare these expenses. An interesting one that not only allows you to compare costs but also asks questions to help you sort out your "gut feelings" towards remodeling versus moving can be found at RemodelOrMove.com [http://www.remodelormove.com/index.cfm].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keep in mind that costs for loans and moving tend to fall into line with budget projections, while remodeling costs often exceed them, swelled by change orders, delays in delivering materials and unexpected problems that crop up during construction, like leaky pipes that are discovered when the drywall is removed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Age and obsolescence: Although you don't say how old each house is, you need to take their relative ages into account, because that can make a difference in the eyes of future buyers. How much depends on the actual age of each house. For instance, if the larger house is 15 years old, and your current house is 20 years old, there may not be much of a qualitative difference between the two in most buyers' eyes. But if you only plan to put an addition on your home, it won't be competitive with a house that's five years old or younger, and won't appreciate as quickly. A house that's new will have an updated floor plan, a current kitchen and bath, and materials, fixtures and finishes that have yet to see much wear and tear -- well worth the $50 extra you'll pay per month on the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy: You may get bargain rates from remodelers trying to keep their businesses in the black during a tough economy (though $33 a square foot for a 750-square-foot addition seems awfully low). But as home prices continue to fall, many people are seeing their home equity lines of credit shrink or get cut off -- so don't expect them to be reliable sources of funds for a renovation. What's more, most of the measures the government is currently considering to stimulate housing, including mortgage rate buy-downs and tax credits, are targeted towards people who are purchasing homes, not those who are refinancing or remodeling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bottom line: If you remodel your house instead of moving, you'll be able to get exactly what you want and will have total control over the final result. But given the costs, uncertainties and hassles of remodeling -- and the fact that you have a buyer in hand for your current home -- if I were you, I'd trade up.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The glut of homes listed for sale continues to shrink gradually in many metropolitan areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, the supply of homes available for sale in 29 major metropolitan areas was down 3.6% from a month earlier, according to figures compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a real-estate brokerage firm based in Emeryville, Calif. The ZipRealty data cover all single-family homes, condominiums and town houses listed on local multiple-listing services in the 29 metro areas where the firm operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a national basis, home inventories typically decline modestly in November from October. Over the past 25 years, the average decrease in November has been 1.9%, according to Zelman &amp;Associates, a research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The November inventory in ZipRealty's 29 metro areas was down about 10% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, about 4.2 million previously occupied homes were listed for sale at the end of October, according to the National Association of Realtors. That is enough to last about 10 months at the current sales rate, the trade group says. The housing market is considered roughly in balance between supply and demand when the inventory is around six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These inventory data don't capture the entire supply. Newly constructed housing and foreclosed homes, a big part of the supply, aren't always included in Realtors' multiple-listing services.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sellers appear to have finally gotten the message that if you don't have to sell, don't put your house on the market right now," says Patrick Lashinsky, Zip's chief executive officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Zip data don't cover New York City.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A forecasting gauge of home sales dipped in October, but the decline was much smaller than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' index for pending sales of previously owned homes decreased 0.7% to 88.9 from 89.5 in September, the industry group said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private analysts projected pending sales would fall 3.5% during October. The gauge had gone down 4.3% during September; that's a revision up from a previously estimated 4.6% decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR pending sales index, based on signed contracts for previously owned homes, was 1.0% below the level of 89.8 in October 2007. Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, said home sales have been steady.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Despite the turmoil in the economy, the overall level of pending home sales has been remarkably stable over the past year, holding in a generally narrow range," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its monthly forecast on the industry, the NAR projected existing-home sales at 4.96 million this year and 5.19 million in 2009. That compares with 5.65 million in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for an existing home is seen at $198,500 in 2008 and $199,200 in 2009. It was $218,900 in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A month ago, the NAR forecast 2008 sales at 5.02 million and 2009 sales at 5.32 million. The 2008 median price was projected at $198,600 and the 2009 price at $200,800.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR's pending home sales index was designed to try measuring which way the housing market is going in the future. It is based on pending sales of existing homes, including single-family homes and condominiums. A home sale is pending when the contract has been signed but the transaction hasn't closed. Pending sales typically close within one or two months of signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, the Northeast increased 0.6% in October from September; it had gone down 14.1% since October 2007. The Midwest fell 4.3% in October from September; it had decreased 6.8% since October 2007. The South increased 7.8% in October from September; it had fallen 2.9% since October 2007. The West declined 8.7% in October from September; it has gone higher by 17.4% since October 2007.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">See Corrections &amp;Amplifications below [mark]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two board members of <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties Inc</span>. marched into CEO John Bucksbaum's office to deliver a blunt message: It was time for him to resign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An internal investigation showed that Mr. Bucksbaum's family trust had violated company policy by making private loans to two company officers and failing to inform the board. The departure of Mr. Bucksbaum -- whose father and uncle founded the giant mall owner 54 years ago -- would mark an end to the family's management control of the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I accept the decision," Mr. Bucksbaum said, according to people briefed on the Oct. 24 meeting. "I'll do what's in the best interest of the company and its shareholders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the harm to the legacy and the fortune of the Bucksbaum family -- one of the richest and oldest real-estate dynasties in America -- had already been done. Aside from the loans, made to prevent a massive stock selloff by executives, Mr. Bucksbaum and his deputies in recent years loaded the company with debts totaling more than $27 billion. General Growth's stock has plunged more than 97% in the past year, dragging down the Bucksbaum family fortunes with it. The Bucksbaums' 25% ownership stake, worth $3.2 billion just six months ago, is now worth $116 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family could lose General Growth altogether, along with three generations of hard work that began with a grocery store in Iowa. If the company can't negotiate new terms with lenders by midnight Friday, and those banks declare the company in default, General Growth has told investors it could file for Chapter 11 -- creating one of the largest bankruptcies ever in real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bucksbaum's losses show how the 2008 financial crisis is hitting not just risk-loving Wall Street firms and leveraged upstarts but also long-established, family-run companies with histories of conservative growth. The crisis has sparked the most rapid and severe destruction of wealth in recent history, rivaled only by the Great Depression, when the number of millionaires plunged by an estimated 75%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fallen fortunes span the globe, from Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino king whose paper fortune has dropped by more than $25 billion in the past year, to Germany's old-money Merckle family and Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal. Even Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, the dynamic duo at the top of the global billionaire ranks, have seen the value of their corporate shares shrink by $12 billion and $15 billion, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many got caught in an unavoidable downdraft. But others have themselves to blame for making things worse. The crisis has been particularly hard on executives who gambled badly with their business -- they got into the wrong industry at the wrong time, took on risky investments, piled too much debt on their companies, or leveraged their own finances to a catastrophic degree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline of General Growth is as much a matter of pride as it is money, since the Bucksbaums are still wealthy by any standard. They've collected roughly $590 million in dividends from the company since 1997. Martin and Matthew Bucksbaum, the company's founding brothers, were astute financial investors who also made more than $1 billion from early investments with hedge-funder Edward Lampert, investor Jack Nash and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, according to two financial advisers to the family. And the company's malls are still among the strongest in the U.S., with an overall occupancy rate of about 93%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matthew Bucksbaum declined to be interviewed regarding his personal finances or General Growth's struggles. John Bucksbaum says he remains "actively involved" in the company as chairman of the board, adding, "We have great assets, great employees. Our issues are not with the operations of these properties, it's with the balance sheet. We'll be able to restore the value that these properties hold."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short of cash and unable to make debt payments, General Growth is struggling to sell off some of its prized malls and properties, including three on the Las Vegas Strip. It has $900 million in loans due on Friday, another $3.1 billion due next year and, in a leftover from its acquisition of competitor Rouse Co. in 2004, the company could owe up to $1 billion to the heirs of legendary tycoon Howard Hughes. The company has hired law firm Sidley Austin LLP to advise it in the event of a bankruptcy filing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This family worked so hard for so long to get where they are," says Morris Mark, president of Mark Asset Management and a former board member and friend of the family's. "It's sad to see the company in such difficulty."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Grocery Fortune</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bucksbaums, rooted in the mom-and-pop grocery business of Iowa, are a tightknit, driven and intensely private family. Martin and Matthew Bucksbaum started in 1954 with a small shopping center in Cedar Rapids, which they built to house one of the family's grocery stores. They installed trampolines in the parking lot on opening day for visiting children and opened a Kinney Shoes and a Woolworth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project's success led them to open more shopping centers. As America's suburbs started to boom, they started building large indoor malls, a strategy known among mall builders as "following the rooftops."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin, known as the more commanding of the two brothers, was obsessed with financial details, spending late nights in the office poring over leasing statements or depreciation schedules, and rarely taking vacations. He was a strategic visionary, credited by some urban planners -- and blamed by others -- for the early malling of America. He had few hobbies and died in his sleep from a heart attack in 1995.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What was Martin's hobby? Work," says Leon Cooperman, the billionaire hedge-fund investor and longtime friend of the Bucksbaum family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matthew, now 82 and retired, is more shy and has more outside interests than his brother. He and his wife, Kay, are avid art collectors and music supporters. Their condo on the 70th floor of a luxury high-rise in downtown Chicago is filled with modern art and hand-crafted furniture. At their stone-and-timber vacation compound in Aspen, Colo., on Red Mountain and assessed by county officials at $20 million, the Bucksbaums frequently host dinners for famous musicians like cellist Yo-Yo Ma and violinist Joshua Bell. Their annual New Year's party has become one of Aspen's most coveted invites, attracting Madeleine Albright and other dignitaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Iowa to Los Angeles</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Growth's debt troubles date back to the mid-1990s, when Martin's health began to weaken. The family had been conservative managers, building the dominant shopping venues in secondary and tertiary towns like Bettendorf, Iowa, Hutchinson, Kan., and Fayetteville, Ark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after emerging in 1993 for a second stint as a public company, the Bucksbaums decided to grow through acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1994, General Growth bought a 40% stake in CenterMark Properties, which owned 16 regional malls in major cities such as Los Angeles and Washington. A year later, it nearly doubled its size, teaming with four investment partners to buy <span class="companylink">Sears, Roebuck &amp;Co</span>.'s Homart development division to take over 40 malls. Martin Bucksbaum died, at 74, as the Homart deal was being completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matthew, president at the time, was then named CEO and chairman. There were no other candidates considered for the job, since he and Martin were such a close team, board members say. Matthew moved the company headquarters to Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also groomed his son, John Bucksbaum, to take the company's helm. Reserved, solitary and competitive in and out of the office, John Bucksbaum, now 52, is a dedicated mogul skier and cyclist. He logs thousands of miles each year on his bike, sometimes riding with Lance Armstrong. In 1999, Matthew and the board named John as CEO and, once again, there were no competing candidates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"John was extremely well-trained by both his father and uncle," says Mr. Mark, who was a board member during the transition. "It was a natural evolution for a family-controlled business."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet John proved to be a different kind of manager than his late uncle. Like his father, he focused more on General Growth's internal operations, leaving many aspects of finance and acquisitions mostly to his lieutenants, primarily chief financial officer Bernie Freibaum. It was a role that for decades had been played by Martin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lawyer and CPA known for his hardball negotiating tactics, Mr. Freibaum, now 56, became the company's finance architect. His tenure coincided with a broader shift in the way some real-estate companies were financing their operations. Rather than apply for bank loans, General Growth began taking out short-term mortgages on its malls. As the mortgages came due, the company would replace them with even larger mortgages to provide cash for additional acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strategy picked up steam with the emergence of new debt-trading markets. In the mid-1990s, lenders started slicing up commercial mortgages and selling them to multiple investors as bonds. The boom in trading made mortgage-backed debt much cheaper and more plentiful -- as long as investors were willing to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Growth was soon at the forefront of this market. And because the company was borrowing mostly against its individual properties, lenders didn't place restrictions on its overall debt load, allowing it to accumulate more and more debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Growth's ratio of its debt as a percentage of its asset value has soared to 83%, compared to 63% for mall owner <span class="companylink">Macerich Co</span>., 54% for <span class="companylink">Simon Property</span> and 48% for <span class="companylink">Taubman Centers</span>, according to Green Street Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We never had any more leverage than we thought was necessary," Mr. Freibaum said in an interview last March. "It just so happens that the biggest names in the mall sector had a different strategy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Freibaum declined to comment for this article.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A $20 Billion Debt Load</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August 2004, General Growth made its biggest acquisition to date: $12 billion for Rouse Co. Rouse owned three dozen upscale malls in the Midwest and Northeast, including Chicago's Water Tower Place, Boston's Faneuil Hall and Columbia, Md.'s Columbia Town Center. The deal instantly transformed General Growth from a small-town, industry stalwart to one of the leading lights of marquee retailing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also marked a turning point in General Growth's fortunes, more than doubling its debt load to $20 billion. Most of the borrowing was backed through mortgages rather than more traditional corporate borrowings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company inherited an unusual obligation from Rouse. In buying thousands of acres outside of Las Vegas from the Howard Hughes estate in 1994, Rouse had negotiated to pay half the appraised value of the land in early 2010. With that bill soon coming due, General Growth as Rouse's successor faces paying several dozen Hughes heirs, scattered around the country, up to $1 billion in cash or stock. Even if the appraised value of the land falls, the company could still owe millions, according to analysts' estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Rouse deal, John Bucksbaum and Mr. Freibaum made other acquisitions, including buying out General Growth's partners in the Homart malls for $2 billion last year, pushing the company's debt load to more than $27 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That didn't appear to be a problem until August 2007, when the credit markets froze on concerns about subprime mortgages. The commercial-mortgage market that General Growth relied on essentially vanished. Unable to refinance mortgages, Mr. Freibaum spoke publicly about selling stakes in several malls, but he didn't strike a deal. By September 2008, the stock was down 60% from its 2007 high of $67 a share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock plunge set off a second crisis: Top executives had to dump millions of their General Growth shares to cover margin calls. Many executives had borrowed heavily to buy General Growth stock. Mr. Freibaum bought 7.6 million shares -- more than 3% of General Growth's total -- mostly on margin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bucksbaum family's trust loaned Mr. Freibaum $90 million and President and Chief Operating Officer Bob Michaels $10 million to meet the margin requirements without dumping stock. Any executive sale of stocks would have had to be publicly disclosed, which could have spooked investors and led to more selloffs. The board said it had no knowledge of the loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet by August and September, the stock had fallen so far that General Growth executives couldn't avoid selling roughly 8.5 million shares to cover margin calls. By early October, the board's patience with Mr. Freibaum had run out, and it voted to dismiss him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't until later that month that the board heard rumors about the Bucksbaum trust's loans and confronted John Bucksbaum, who acknowledged the loans, according to people familiar with the matter. While not illegal, the loans violated company policy, since they could pose a conflict of interest. Mr. Bucksbaum, for instance, might be less likely to discipline or fire Mr. Freibaum or Mr. Michaels because of their financial ties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following a weeklong investigation by Chicago law firm Winston &amp;Strawn LLP, board members Adam Metz and Thomas Nolan, both commercial-real-estate veterans, went to Mr. Bucksbaum's office and told him the board would seek his resignation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bucksbaum remains chairman, but Mr. Metz now serves as interim CEO, the first nonfamily member to hold the post. Mr. Nolan became president, replacing Mr. Michaels, who remains operations chief. Mr. Michaels, who repaid his loan, didn't return calls seeking comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the board talks, Mr. Bucksbaum said there was no ill intent by the family trust in making the loans. But he said he had made an error in judgment in not informing the board, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, John Bucksbaum said he remains "very involved" at General Growth and his removal as CEO was a mutual decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bucksbaums, meanwhile, have seen their personal fortunes fall with the company's. According to friends, Matthew and Kay have decided to cancel their annual holiday party in Aspen.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chattering classes have offered many proposals to stabilize the housing market, from cutting interest rates to rewriting mortgage contracts to generously giving out government subsidies to lenders and borrowers alike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is a much simpler, more elegant solution to lowering monthly costs for homeowners: cut property taxes. This solution will not distort the market with payouts to bad actors or violate the sanctity of contracts. And it would help stimulate the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is probably no place where property tax cuts are more urgently needed than in upstate and western New York -- all the territory of the state outside New York City's five boroughs and Long Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today the once prosperous upstate economy is in tatters. It's been in an economic decline for decades, giving much of it a Depression-era feel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A quarter of Buffalo's housing stock is vacant and its poverty rate is twice the nation's. The city has lost half its population since 1950. Syracuse, Rochester and Albany have shrunk by a third. Between 2000 and 2007, the region as a whole lost 32,000 jobs. Meanwhile, neighboring Pennsylvania gained 84,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason for this is that the region has become property-tax hell. A look at the numbers tells the story. When every U.S. county is ranked according to its average property-tax bill as a percent of home values, nine of the worst 10 are in upstate New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All housing markets are local and local government policies can have an enormous impact on property values. Higher property tax rates, for example, inevitably send home values downward. Why? A $6,000 tax bill adds $500 to a monthly mortgage, and simultaneously reduces the amount a buyer would be willing or able to pay for a home. Cut the tax bill and you help struggling homeowners hold onto their houses. And lower taxes allow would-be buyers to spend more for homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High property taxes also discourage investment in new homes. Builders won't build where property taxes drive buyers away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem of heavy property taxes crushing fragile upstate economies has not gone unnoticed, just unsolved. A special Commission on Property Tax Relief, supported by Democrat Gov. David Paterson, recommended in August that local property tax increases be capped at 4% annually or 1.2 times the inflation rate -- whichever is less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That wouldn't have cut taxes, but it would have moved New York toward a less oppressive tax system. And for a moment, it seemed that the idea might even take off when the state Senate passed a tax-cap bill earlier this year. But the state Assembly voted instead to raise marginal tax rates on incomes above $1 million and use the proceeds to pay for property tax relief for low-income homeowners. That standoff all but killed tax reform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The force that shifted the legislature against tax reform was applied by public employee unions. Following the Senate vote, the New York State United Teachers (NYSUT) went to war. It suspended Senate endorsements for all who voted for the tax cap and threatened Assembly members with similar treatment. Along with other interest groups, NYSUT spent $1.85 million in anti-cap TV and radio ads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NYSUT has long been a central actor in driving up property taxes by demanding ever greater spending on public schools. This school year, New Yorkers (even excluding the Big Apple) will spend $18,768 per pupil, more than any state in the union and 50% above the national average. Upstate school enrollments have fallen 15,900 since 2000. Nonetheless, over the same period NYSUT has secured 5,000 new teaching and 7,400 new nonteaching positions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is that tax incentives work quickly and powerfully. Today San Francisco and Boston, for example, are considered "superstar cities." But it is often forgotten that both were, like upstate New York, in decline for much of the post-World War II era. San Francisco's population fell 12% between 1950 and 1980, and in the early 1970s it had a higher proportion of families with incomes below the poverty level than Albany, Rochester and Syracuse. Boston's 30% population decline between 1950 and 1980 was slightly below Buffalo's 38% figure, but it lost more manufacturing jobs than Buffalo over that period and its 1970 poverty rate was higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the 1980 census, however, San Francisco's population has surged 14% and its real, median household income is up 35%. Boston's population grew 5% and its real income 26%. How did they turn things around?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both were high-tax jurisdictions that benefited from statewide ballot initiatives that suddenly made them friendlier to capital. Voters capped property taxes in California at 1% of market value with Proposition 13 in 1978. That forced San Francisco to cut its rate by 57% overnight and brought forth a tidal wave of investment, even amidst a recession. By 1982, inflation-adjusted city revenues were two-thirds higher than they had been before Prop. 13. Massachusetts voters passed Prop 2 ½ in 1980, forcing Boston's property tax rate down by an estimated 75% within two years. Massive reinvestment, repopulation and urban renewal followed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In upstate New York, local officials facing declining tax receipts will feel enormous pressure to hike property taxes in order to maintain spending levels. But that would drive property values lower, choke off investment, and exacerbate the crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As California and Massachusetts showed a generation ago, cutting property taxes would be a much better approach. It would make upstate and western New York attractive to capital while also helping homeowners keep up with their mortgage payments. Indeed, local and state officials nationwide can institute what would probably be the most effective possible housing stabilization policy. But unlike a bailout, this tax cut remedy would likely be popular with voters.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ford Models founder Eileen Ford, whose agency represented some of the biggest modeling names for decades, this week cut the price of her New Jersey mansion by 19% to $6.5 million, after it went unsold at $8 million for two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ford's husband and business partner, Jerry Ford, died in August at age 83. Their agency represented Lauren Hutton, Veronica Webb and Christie Brinkley, and some credit the Fords with key roles in establishing the modern modeling industry. The house is about 45 miles west of New York City, in Hunterdon County. The classic colonial estate, on a hill with views of the countryside, has seven bedrooms and six bathrooms on 20 acres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ford, now 86, and her husband first built the house in the early 1990s, but in 1993 it burned nearly to the ground; the Fords rebuilt it exactly as before, reimporting antique Dutch tiles and French doors and finishing in 1995. Bea Daggett, of Turpin Realtors, has the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ford agency was sold last year to Stone Tower Equity Partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calvin Klein Co-Founder's Vacant Lot: $23.9 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Off Miami Beach, Calvin Klein co-founder Barry Schwartz is putting a vacant three-acre bayfront parcel up for sale for $23.9 million, 54% more than he paid in November 2005, on an island popular with celebrities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schwartz and his wife, Sheryl, bought the parcel, with 300 feet on Biscayne Bay, for $15.5 million, public records show. The parcel is on Indian Creek island, a small gated community. Singer Julio Iglesias, a longtime resident, paid $7 million for a home nearly a year ago while he builds a new house on a larger lot (also on the island), and basketball coach Rick Pitino, now at the University of Louisville, is asking $14.9 million for his waterfront house. Investor Carl Icahn is another neighbor. Ralph Arias, of SOL <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, has the Schwartz listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Longtime friends, Mr. Schwartz and Calvin Klein owned the apparel company together until it was sold in 2002 to <span class="companylink">Phillips-Van Heusen Corp</span>. Mr. Schwartz no longer visits Miami regularly, Mr. Arias says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lender's Former CEO Offers San Diego Home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen H. Gordon, a longtime banking executive who led an unsuccessful effort to turn around <span class="companylink">Fremont General Corp</span>., has listed his San Diego County home for $12 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mediterranean-style house of about 11,000 square feet, in the community of Rancho Santa Fe, has six bedrooms, 61/2 baths, a gym and a wine cellar. In 2003, Mr. Gordon bought the property of just over eight acres, with a barn and riding arena, for $6.4 million and completely rebuilt the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Struggling Fremont, once a highflier in the subprime-mortgage industry, hired Mr. Gordon as chief executive officer in November 2007. The Santa Monica, Calif., company filed for bankruptcy-court protection last June. In July its bank subsidiary sold its 22 branches and all deposits to <span class="companylink">CapitalSource Bank</span>. Mr. Gordon later stepped down as CEO. Laura A. Barry, of Barry Estates, has the listing.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Lower Rates Help Sell Houses, but Market Faces Broader Ills</span>
</div><div class="author">By Michael Corkery and Nick Timiraos </div><div>915 words</div><div>5 December 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A possible move by the Treasury Department to push down mortgage rates has raised the hopes of home buyers, real-estate agents and economists -- and the share prices of residential builders and related businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the proposal, if implemented as reported, won't be a cure-all for the myriad problems that have curtailed buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury is considering a plan that could enable banks to lend at rates as low as 4.5%, which is more than a full point lower than the prevailing rates on standard 30-year mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are going to see what this does to their mortgage payment, and they will be kicking themselves if they don't jump in and buy," said David Romero, chief operating officer of Century 21 Award in San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower rates alone, however, can't overcome the job losses, lack of down payments and poor credit that have all but frozen the market. And then there are the big-picture factors keeping some would-be buyers on the fence, including worries about the economy and a rocky stock market that is eroding retirement savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists also argue that the plan wouldn't help borrowers most in need, including those who owe more than their homes are worth, and therefore might not reduce foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nine of the top 10 issues hurting sales have to do with poor consumer confidence," said Larry Sorsby, chief financial officer of builder <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span> in Red Bank, N.J. "You are being bombarded by bad economic news, and people are in fear of keeping their jobs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates on 30-year mortgages plunged this week to the lowest level since January, after the government launched a sweeping effort to aid the housing market. Mortgage-finance giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> reported Thursday that average rates on 30-year fixed mortgages dropped to 5.53% from 5.97% last week -- the largest one-week drop in 27 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders, which saw the Dow Jones Wilshire Home Construction Index jump 5.94% Thursday on news that the Treasury was considering the mortgage plan, are still hoping the government does more to spur demand. Their wish list includes a $22,000 tax credit for home buyers and a mortgage-rate buydown that would trim rates to as low as 2.99%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A 4.5% rate is a positive step, but it's not enough to do the job," Mr. Sorsby said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reducing rates by about one percentage point would effectively lower home prices for buyers by roughly 10%, said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, which has championed the proposal being considered by the Treasury. The group says each percentage-point reduction in interest could sell between 500,000 and 800,000 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to investment bank <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>, 16% of all mortgages, or 8.1 million in all, will be in foreclosure over the next four years. In April, the firm forecast there would be 6.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed initiative might allow someone considering a $200,000 mortgage to take out a $225,000 loan without paying more interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides lowering monthly payments, a 4.5% rate would allow buyers to qualify for larger mortgages with less income. With rates around 5.5%, a buyer typically needs income of $92,000, assuming a 10% down payment, to qualify for a $400,000 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. When rates drop to 4.5%, income of $84,000 is needed to qualify, said David Stevens, president of real-estate firm <span class="companylink">Long &amp;Foster Cos</span>. in Chantilly, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower rates would be especially beneficial for buyers of higher-priced homes. In recent months, first-time buyers and bargain-hunting investors have been snapping up lower-priced homes, but pricier ones haven't been selling as quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lower rates "could free up the move-up and middle-priced markets," Mr. Stevens said. "And that could raise the average sales prices in many markets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Word that the government may try to push down mortgage rates comes as house prices have fallen 22% nationally since their peak, and likely dropped further as the financial crisis intensified the past two months. Lowering rates could help establish a floor under home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In parts of California's Inland Empire, a hard-hit housing market east of Los Angeles, falling rates have been enticing buyers in recent days, said local real-estate agent Graham Holmes. Since the Federal Reserve announced plans on Nov. 25 to buy $600 billion of mortgage debt, Mr. Holmes has had three houses enter into contracts, compared with one the previous week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some buyers were on the borderline in qualifying for the payments, and these lower rates have brought them in line," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But broader forces are countering efforts to expand the buyer pool. Job losses are mounting most among 25-to-34-year-olds, a critical segment of first-time buyers. Foreclosures and credit-card defaults are hurting others' credit scores. Meanwhile, banks have tightened standards, making it tougher for buyers to qualify.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You need good credit to take advantage of low interest rates," said Craig Beggins, president of Century 21, Beggins Enterprises, in Tampa Bay, Fla. "And there's not enough people with good credit left."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Simon   </div><div>930 words</div><div>4 December 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; C1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications to refinance home-mortgages jumped by a record amount, as borrowers flocked to take advantage of falling mortgage rates -- which were driven down by the government's announcement that it would step in to stabilize the mortgage market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that its index of refinance applications had tripled, the largest increase since the group began tracking this data in 1990.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications to purchase homes, which tend to be less sensitive to interest-rate movements, also increased, though by a smaller amount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge in application volume comes as mortgage rates fell by more than 0.50 percentage point. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages have moved up slightly. They currently average 5.75%, according to HSH Associates in Pompton Plains, N.J., compared with an average of 6.16% just before the government announcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates fell last week after the Federal Reserve announced that it would purchase as much as $600 billion of debt issued or backed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, Ginnie Mae and Federal Home Loan banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The drop in rates seems to have had its desired effect," says <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group</span> mortgage strategist Mahesh Swaminathan. As many as 85% of borrowers with conforming mortgages (those eligible for backing by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>), now have an incentive to refinance compared with 7% at the start of November, according to a recent analysis by <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under a Treasury Department plan in the discussion phase, mortgage behemoths Fannie Mac and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> would use their resources to push the rate on a 30-year fixed loan down as far as 4.5% for home purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the recent increase, application volume remains lower than it was as recently as March. Last week's numbers are adjusted for the shortened holiday week, which can make comparisons more difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The key here is whether these lower rates will be sustained," says Orawin Velz, an associate vice president at the Mortgage Bankers Association, noting that the drop in rates following the government takeover of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> proved to be short-lived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If rates remain low, it could be good news for home sales, particularly in markets where falling home prices have boosted affordability, says Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lawler calls the decline in rates "an unabashed positive" for the housing market. But the "bang per buck" isn't likely to be as great as in previous interest-rate cycles since "so many people with a mortgage outstanding will have trouble refinancing because of the valuation of their home or their own credit situation," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage lenders say application volume remains strong and some are taking steps to keep it that way. At <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co</span>., application volume on Monday and Tuesday was "triple what we had done [on a daily basis] over the previous month," a company spokesman says. At <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>., call volume and applications are running one-and-a-half to two times expectations. As rates have declined, the company has begun reaching out to a larger group of borrowers who might benefit from refinancing at lower rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loan officers at <span class="companylink">SunTrust Banks Inc</span>. have begun calling existing clients to tell them they may benefit from lower rates. Refinances now account for half of applications, up from 30% to 39% before the rate drop, the company says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the mortgage unit of <span class="companylink">Long &amp;Foster Real Estate</span>, based in Fairfax, Va., the number of borrowers who locked in a mortgage rate climbed by 300% in the past 10 days compared with the same period a month earlier, says David Stevens, president of <span class="companylink">Long &amp;Foster Cos</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Long &amp;Foster</span> is organizing a contest to encourage loan officers to bring in more refinance applications. It also is planning to step up print advertising and use direct mail and phone calls to reach out to former customers who might benefit from a refinance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How many applications will wind up as actual mortgages remains to be seen. In southeastern Florida, about one-third or less of refinancing applications are leading to loans, says W.D. Acosta, executive vice president for residential lending at <span class="companylink">Seacoast National Bank</span>, down from as much as 80% two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many of the people who need refinances don't have the equity in their home or ... their job situation isn't what it was when the loan was originated," he says. Nationwide, the "pull through" rate is about 55% for purchase applications and 65% for refinance applications submitted in the first half of this year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, borrowers who have good credit may be able to take advantage of lower rates even if they owe more than the value of their home. <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, for instance, will let certain borrowers refinance into a new loan with a lower mortgage rate even if their current loan equals as much as 120% of the property's current value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glen Lazovick, director of mortgage lending at the Mid-Atlantic Federal Credit Union in Germantown, Md., says refinancing can make sense if you can recover your costs in less than two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers with large loans can save on relatively small interest-rate decreases, Mr. Lazovick says. Borrowers with small mortgages would need to see rates fall by a larger amount to realize meaningful savings.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toledo, Ohio, dubbed the Glass City and the Auto Parts Capital of the World, is searching for a new identity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city of 300,000 on the western tip of Lake Erie blossomed as a glass manufacturer and then a supplier for Detroit, 60 miles to the north. But the automotive industry's woes have stirred up fear among Toledo real-estate investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toledo's leaders are looking to attract younger and more diverse workers to the area as they scramble to reduce their city's exposure to Detroit's troubles. They have created a $22 million venture-capital fund that brings entrepreneurs to Toledo and are constructing a $105 million sports arena to be finished next year that will house an arena football and minor-league hockey teams. They hope Toledo's nascent solar-energy industry creates manufacturing jobs for residents formerly employed by the glass and auto industries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The main concern is jobs," said Harlan Reichle, a managing director in the Toledo office of real-estate-services firm <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group Inc</span>. "The crucial thing is transitioning our economy and making it less dependent on manufacturing and trying to move it into higher-growth wage segments."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge seems to be getting steeper by the day. <span class="companylink">Chrysler LLC</span> said in October that it would lay off more than 850 employees at its Toledo Jeep assembly plant because of slow sales. Car-parts manufacturer <span class="companylink">Dana Holding Corp</span>. is selling its Toledo headquarters, moving to the suburbs, and eliminating 5,000 jobs across the company -- including at least 100 in Toledo. And many fear the biggest wave hasn't hit yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're all holding our breath now given what has transpired in the last 30 to 60 days," Mr. Reichle said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toledo's unemployment rate of 7.8% in September was well above the national average of 6.5%, according to Labor Department figures, and up from 5.9% in the year-ago month. The area has lost 4,700 nonfarm jobs in the last year, including 2,200 manufacturing jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toledo hasn't been hurt as much by the bursting of the housing bubble as many warmer parts of the country. The median home price in the area dropped to $100,400 in the third quarter, compared with $107,100 the year before, according to the National Association of Realtors. The 6.3% decline is better than the 9% drop in house prices across the U.S.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, real-estate developers in the area are hitting the brakes. "We're not going to buy anything for a while; we don't know the impact of the auto industry on our affairs," said Harvey Tolson, one of the largest holders of commercial real estate in the area. "Bankruptcy, if that were to happen, for our area would just be a disaster."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers behind an effort to convert an old downtown steam plant into an apartment complex in June abandoned plans to build 32 townhouses next to it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We thought there was a high-end unit market downtown," said the developer, David Ball of STS Property &amp;Facility Management Inc. "The housing market changed on us in the 11th hour." Mr. Ball and his partner, former National Basketball Association player Jim Jackson, hope to rent out the 77 units for about $1,000 a month for 1,000-square-foot units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors in office and industrial property hope the economic downturn eventually attracts companies looking to cut costs. That means higher-quality office space is a tough sell. Toledo real-estate investor John Barone said some of his class A office space is going for as low as $17 a square foot. His class A space is about 75% full, while his class B space, which rents for $13.50 to $16, is about 93% full.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We may not be one of the sexiest cities in the country, but I think there's some good that comes along with that," Mr. Ball said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the glut of foreclosed homes swells, banks and other lenders are starting to warm to the idea of selling some of the homes in bulk to investors, a departure from the practice of selling homes one at a time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past year, investors have been eager to buy large numbers of homes from lenders at knockdown prices. Lenders have generally resisted that idea, but now some are trying it out on a small scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> estimates that banks and loan investors owned 871,000 foreclosed homes as of Nov. 1, up from 414,000 a year earlier. <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> forecasts that this inventory will peak at around 1.4 million homes in mid-2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That deluge has persuaded some banks to start bargaining. In recent months, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp;Co</span>., <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Synovus Financial Corp</span>. have negotiated a few transactions and have signaled to investors they might be willing to do others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, no major lender has fully embraced the idea of selling in bulk. In many cases, they say prices that investors are demanding remain too low. The banks say they can get more money for most homes selling them through local agents. If investors buy homes and quickly flip them for a higher price, banks feel they have just let a middleman earn proceeds they should have been able to get on their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are getting a ton of bottom fishers," says Barbara Desoer, president of mortgage and insurance services at <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>., but the prices being offered aren't attractive. Ms. Desoer says <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, which this year became the nation's largest mortgage lender by acquiring <span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial</span>, isn't doing bulk sales for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, others are starting to experiment on a limited basis. <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, the nation's second-largest home mortgage lender, expects to keep selling most of the homes one by one through local agents. But in the past six months, the bank has completed half a dozen bulk sales and is evaluating another one, says Ben Windust, a senior vice president at the banking company. He says each such sale has involved 20 to 40 properties. In most cases, the sales involved homes that proved difficult to sell through local real-estate agents or that need lots of repair work to make them salable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders seem more comfortable considering bulk sales of low-value homes in marginal neighborhoods and in regions where housing demand is weakest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Odell Barnes, an investor in South Carolina, says he and a group of investor partners recently paid about $1.2 million for a bulk purchase of about 800 homes from <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>. That works out to about $1,500 apiece on average. A large share of the homes were in Detroit and other depressed Michigan cities; others were in cities including Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, Memphis, Tenn., and Toledo, Ohio. Mr. Barnes says he quickly resold for about $50,000 one of the Detroit homes purchased from Fannie for $1,800.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> spokesman declined to comment, but the company has acknowledged an openness to considering bulk sales. Fannie has a huge and expanding backlog of homes to sell. It reported last month that its inventory of single-family foreclosed homes on Sept. 30 was 67,519, about twice as many as it owned nine months earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie's main rival, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, says it is open to bulk sales but hasn't been able to reach acceptable terms. "We don't accept 20 or 30 cents on the dollar," says James "Chris" Bowden, a Freddie vice president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gibraltar Global Group LLC, Shelton, Conn., created in January by executives with experience in corporate relocation services, has completed several small bulk purchases, says Jim Simon, chief executive. Gibraltar makes repairs when necessary and then lists the homes for sale through local brokers, he says, adding: "Frequently the houses are in terrible condition."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Simon says he and his colleagues got experience in finding buyers for foreclosed homes in the housing downturn of the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some homes get sold at least twice before new occupants move in. An example is a three-bedroom house on Burnt Leaf Lane in Snellville, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta. The home had sold in March 2007 for $116,900. After the owners defaulted, Saxon Mortgage, owned by <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, acquired it through foreclosure in April 2008. Saxon sold the home to Gibraltar for $39,000 in September. Two weeks later, Gibraltar sold the home for $50,000 to Real Property Investment Group LLC of Atlanta. Gibraltar's Mr. Simon says his firm's profit on the transaction after commissions and other costs was $4,600. Normally, he said, Gibraltar sells homes to owner-occupants rather than investors like Real Property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Partly for public-relations reasons, lenders are expected to be more open to considering bulk sales to nonprofit groups seeking to acquire homes in poor neighborhoods as a way to prevent blight and create affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing and Neighborhood Development Services, Orange, N.J., is setting up a nonprofit company to pursue such deals. Harold Simon, executive director of the new company, says it is negotiating to buy mortgages backed by about 100 homes, mostly in northern New Jersey. He declined to identify the seller of those loans.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Karen Blumenthal </div><div>1090 words</div><div>3 December 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Family Finances; D1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The array of great deals on homes, cars and other big-ticket items these days is tempting. But before you get out your checkbook, consider this: Will snagging that awesome price really make you any happier?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a tricky question. Getting a real steal can be awfully satisfying, as behavioral economists and psychologists know. "Getting a good deal takes on its own value," says Leaf Van Boven, a professor of psychology at the University of Colorado in Boulder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a low price may lure us into buying something we don't really need -- or even enjoy, after the thrill wears off. So, says Dr. Van Boven, "It may be useful to ask the question, 'Why am I doing this?'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is that some spending really is more fulfilling. Experts who study happiness have repeatedly found that people get the most joy out of time with family and friends or activities that provide personal enrichment, such as hobbies. What matters is not the amount that we spend, but the quality of the overall experience, so a picnic can be as satisfying as a weekend getaway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Human beings are social animals, so it is no surprise that our greatest sources of happiness and unhappiness are our social relationships," says Daniel Gilbert, a Harvard psychology professor. Some goods, like iPods, actually cut off the outside world. "When it comes to happiness, consumer goods that involve our friends are better than those that replace them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These ideas can be applied to bigger investments. We may be tempted to pick a neighborhood for its status, when its schools, churches or temples or distance from work may be more meaningful factors. Indeed, the research on happiness may provide a useful way to sort through today's discounts: Put aside brand names and think about how a purchase will pay off for you personally. Here's how that might play out with some of today's big-dollar purchases:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying a home. Falling home prices can be frightening, discouraging buyers from jumping in and potential sellers from moving on. But they also offer a great opportunity to buy a first house, trade up to a bigger place or relocate to a more expensive market, since more-expensive homes typically suffer greater price declines than modest homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a longtime Dallas resident, I've never made money on a home sale, but twice, I've leveraged bad housing markets to trade up to nicer homes. Both times, we got more space than we thought we could afford. The second time, the stiff loss we took on the home sale was outweighed by a great deal on a foreclosure in a close-knit neighborhood with great schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, many sellers are ready to deal, and interest rates are still reasonable by historical standards, so the next few months should be a great time to buy a home. What's significant isn't whether the price goes up right away but whether the move will improve your time with family and friends while keeping your budget intact. A home should be a shelter first, not an investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remodeling. With home building in a tailspin, more remodelers and contractors are looking for jobs, so you might get work done more quickly and possibly at better rates than a few years ago. As a result, it may be a good time to take care of needed maintenance or to dive in on that big project you've been saving for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But rather than focus on resale value, try to anticipate how you will look back on the changes and the effect they'll have on your family, as well as whether you'll need to take on more debt to pay for it all. Will redoing the kitchen make the space more accommodating for your family or simply change the look? Would a deck where friends can hang out or a room devoted to a hobby have a more lasting impact than new bathroom fixtures? Of course, you'll want to get at least two or three bids and check references to be sure the contractor has a good track record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying a car. New-car sales have plunged with the one-two punch of last summer's high gasoline prices and the stock market swoon, and car makers and dealers are offering a truckload of incentives. Many also have low-interest financing for customers with good-to-excellent credit records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the pleasure from new wheels can wear off as quickly as that new-car smell, so a new-car purchase may not be as rewarding over time as other bargains. Certainly, we do spend plenty of time in our cars, but a new one isn't likely to improve our relationships with family and friends. This is one area where you may prefer to pay less than you planned and replenish your retirement account with the savings rather than buying more car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late-model used cars may also be an attractive option that is much easier on the checkbook. Even with gasoline prices coming down, used-car prices have continued to tumble, sliding 10% or so since September, says Jack Nerad, executive market analyst at <span class="companylink">Kelley Blue Book</span>. "Somebody else has taken the big depreciation hit," he says, but "you can have all the modern features and plenty of useful life."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting a TV, computer or other big appliance. Average selling prices for front-loading washers, notebook computers and LCD televisions have declined 3% to 4% in the past year, while the average selling price on a plasma television has dropped about 17%, according to market researcher NPD Group. Special offers this season may well cut those prices further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Items like these, which lose their value quickly and have a relatively short life span, rarely justify running up a credit-card debt. But if you're considering a purchase and have the cash, weigh how it will fit into your life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After suffering a wicked case of big-screen envy for several years, I finally broke down last year and bought a 50-incher for our den. It turned out to be one of the best purchases we have made in years. Why? Silly as it may sound, two of the highlights of this past year were a small Super Bowl party with friends and family and enjoying the two-week run of the Olympics with our college-age daughters.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anton Troianovski and Lingling Wei </div><div>1035 words</div><div>3 December 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>.'s Whitehall family of real-estate funds is struggling with weak performance and potentially big losses on some investments made at the top of the real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whitehall is best known for deals such as buying Rockefeller Center in 1996, but has slashed the value of the equity in one of its funds in half and likely will struggle to make a profit on deals such as its purchase of the Stratosphere, a Las Vegas casino, in 2008 and a string of hotel deals in the past two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There also has been some turnover at the top of Whitehall. The group's chief, Stuart Rothenberg, 45 years old, announced recently that he is retiring at the end of the year. The real-estate unit will be run by three people -- Brahm Cramer, Edward Siskind and Todd Williams -- and report to Rich Friedman, the head of Goldman's merchant-banking unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problems in Whitehall mirror those in Goldman. The firm is on track to lose about $2 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter, the first loss in its history as a publicly traded company. Its shares are down 74% from their peak last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the write-downs will come from its investments in real estate. Goldman has raised about $30.6 billion for real-estate investments since 1991 by tapping the firm's own capital, its employees and its network of private-banking clients. About $7.7 billion of that was invested in 2007 and 2008, which are turning out to have been dangerous years for investing in commercial real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides the Stratosphere, which Goldman purchased from financier Carl Icahn, the Whitehall funds have invested in a Manhattan development site and numerous other properties that have all likely dropped in value as prices for commercial real estate have fallen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whitehall, named after Whitehall Street in downtown Manhattan near Goldman's headquarters, has marked the equity value of one of the funds it raised last year -- the $4.8 billion Whitehall 2007 fund -- to about 50 cents on the dollar, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goldman had $3.9 billion on its books in real-estate private-equity investments as of Aug. 29, compared with $20.4 billion in corporate private equity, according to the company's third-quarter earnings report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the $13.7 billion of committed capital in the five funds raised in 2007 and 2008, about $4.9 billion, or 36%, came from Goldman and its employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goldman said its commitment to real-estate investing hasn't changed, and Whitehall won't be affected by its transformation into a bank-holding company. Executives said Whitehall funds have $6 billion in equity that the firm would like to invest in assets made cheap by the real-estate collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We do not believe that the firm's transition to a bank-holding company will have an impact on the firm's strategy, including our real-estate activity," a bank spokeswoman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for Whitehall to succeed in the competitive world of private-equity funds that specialize in real estate, it must overcome its recent performance in the eyes of investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are more competitive real-estate offerings to evaluate today than at any other time," said Anthony Frammartino, a principal at Townsend Group, a pension consultant in Cleveland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whitehall initially developed a stellar reputation in the early 1990s by investing in packages of distressed commercial real-estate assets sold by the <span class="companylink">Resolution Trust Corp</span>., the agency established to dispose of soured loans and other investments made by failing thrifts. Later it made huge profits on deals such as the acquisition of Rockefeller Center and the purchase of a big stake in Canadian real-estate giant Cadillac Fairview in 1995.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in recent years, Whitehall's performance has become anemic. Its funds that started investing in 2000 had generated a net realized return of 7% as of June 30, 2008, according to people familiar with its performance. That put it below almost 90% of its peers, according to these people. Whitehall's 1997 and 1998 funds delivered returns of about 8%, also lower than the majority of its competitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The returns from Whitehall's funds invested in the past two years promise to be worse. According to real-estate research firm <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, Whitehall made $3.1 billion of investments in 176 hotel properties in 2007, a particularly problematic sector. This year it purchased 14 hotels valued at $984 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Stratosphere deal, Whitehall contributed $200 million and borrowed $1.1 billion from Goldman, with $700 million in the form of a first mortgage and $400 million in mezzanine debt, or the piece that fills the gap between equity and the senior mortgage, according to a person familiar with the deal. While Goldman has sold most, if not all, of the $400 million of mezzanine loans to investors, it still is trying to unload the $700 million first mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, the loan was offered at 85 cents on the dollar, according to investors, indicating that Whitehall's $200 million equity in the deal could be under water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stratosphere deal, which included three other Nevada properties, also has a risky "recourse" provision. Whitehall guaranteed $200 million of the $1.1 billion in debt that it borrowed from Goldman. That means Goldman can go after Whitehall's other assets besides the casino itself in the case of a default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other top-of-the-market investments include the Helmsley Building in New York, which Whitehall and a partner acquired for $1.15 billion in December 2007. Since then, the building's value has dropped about 25%, according to valuations on comparable buildings, said Chris Stanley, an associate with the real-estate research firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It will be quite a while before the environment is right that <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> can unload this at a profit," Mr. Stanley said. He added that the building's occupancy is stable and the owners are able to meet their debt payments.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past few years, Americans have had a brutal lesson in the risks of real estate. House prices have crashed more than 35% in some parts of the country, millions of people are losing their homes to foreclosure, and banks are failing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The takeaway? Many Americans still see real estate as their best shot at wealth. In survey after survey, people expect prices to bounce back -- in some cases, as soon as six months from now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those hoping for a quick rebound are likely to be disappointed. Economists and other pros generally say home prices won't bottom out before the second half of 2009, and some don't see a bottom until 2011 or 2012. Even when they stop falling, prices may scrape along the bottom of the rut for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Down the Road</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And longer term? Over the next 10 to 20 years, housing economists expect prices will rise again -- but, on average, probably not nearly as much as they've averaged over the past decade. That isn't to say that some places won't experience booms (and busts). But, the experts say, you should generally expect house prices to rise just a bit more than inflation and roughly in line with household income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karl Case, an economics professor at Wellesley College whose name adorns the S&amp;P Case-Shiller home-price indexes, has studied U.S. house prices going back to the 1890s. Over the long run, he says, home prices tend to increase on average at an inflation-adjusted rate of 2.5% to 3% a year, about the same as per capita income. He thinks that long-run pattern is likely to continue, despite the recent choppiness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other experts make similarly modest predictions. William Wheaton, a professor of economics and real estate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says he expects house prices to increase at a rate roughly one percentage point higher than inflation over the long term. Celia Chen, director of housing economics at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com, a research firm, expects house prices to increase an average of around 4% a year over the next couple of decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some experts say it's a bad idea to count on your home rising in value at all. People should think of their own homes mainly as places to live, not as investments, advises Kenneth Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate at the University of California, Berkeley. Sure, home mortgages provide tax benefits, and most homes appreciate in value over the long run, he says, but there is always risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of those forecasts, many Americans are undaunted. Consider three surveys, all from October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a poll of 2,000 adults, real-estate-data provider Zillow.com found that 61% believed the value of their home would either remain level or rise over the next six months. Another survey of more than 1,000 homeowners, sponsored by real-estate-services firm <span class="companylink">Realogy Corp</span>., found that 91% thought that owning a home was the best long-term investment they could make. And an online survey of 5,000 people commissioned by <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> found that just 32% believed it was a good time to invest in stocks -- but 51% said it was a good time to buy a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I just believe in real estate," says Jason Schram, a lawyer in Chicago who has bought two rental properties this year at what he considers fire-sale prices. "I've seen over and over people I know build wealth through rental real estate, and that's the path I intend taking, even though it's a bit bumpy at the moment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Location, Location</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, as homeowners and buyers look ahead, what factors will determine whether their homes are really likely to rise in value, rather than just in their dreams? What are some of the bullish signs -- and some of the bearish ones?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the long term, house prices are driven by fundamentals that are hard to predict: immigration, birth rates, the size and nature of households, and incomes. The trick is to figure out where job and income growth will be strongest and where immigrants and others will want to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Frey, a demographer and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington, says young people and immigrants are likely to flow to Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, Virginia, Nevada, Arizona and some of the more affordable interior parts of California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These areas generally have lower housing costs than the Pacific Coast or Northeast and job growth from modern industries and leisure businesses, he says. Areas with little immigration and low growth or falling populations are likely to include Michigan, Ohio, the Dakotas, Iowa, western Pennsylvania and upstate New York, Mr. Frey says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hit Parade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newland Communities LLC, a San Diego-based planner and developer of neighborhoods, employs a full-time researcher to study long-term housing demand and ranks metro areas in terms of their growth prospects. Among those near the top of Newland's hit parade are Washington, D.C., Raleigh and Charlotte, N.C., Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Phoenix and Las Vegas, says Robert McLeod, the developer's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of them, Newland believes, will keep growing because they have well-diversified regional economies and other attractions, including mild climates. With the exception of Washington, they all have fairly affordable housing costs. Washington has a highly educated work force, high incomes, a stable source of government-related jobs and rapidly expanding technology firms, Newland says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The older industrial cities are going to suffer" from shrinking employment and forbidding weather, says Mr. Rosen of the University of California. Some Sun Belt cities, including Atlanta, also could languish if traffic jams and sprawl ruin their charms, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among metro areas that Mr. Rosen expects to do well in the long run are Albuquerque, N.M.; Boise, Idaho; Salt Lake City; Seattle; Portland, Ore.; Denver and Colorado Springs, Colo. He says those places generally offer "urban vitality" and "easy access to outdoor activities" combined with affordable housing and good job-growth prospects from modern industries, such as biotechnology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, just looking at population trends isn't enough. Prices in the crowded coastal areas tend to be more volatile, rising and then falling much faster during booms and busts than do inland areas, Mr. Case notes. Shortages of land and building restrictions make it hard for builders to respond quickly when demand for housing rises in coveted neighborhoods near the coasts; further inland, it's usually much easier to find vacant homes or land, and so sudden movements in prices are less likely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, despite rapid growth, home prices in Texas cities have tended to climb only gradually. Those cities typically have plenty of room to sprawl, and Texas regulates land use less strictly than many other states. Supply swells to meet demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wonder Years</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, no one can assess the outlook for housing without considering the effects of 78 million aging baby boomers. For instance, some housing experts believe the boomers will be much less likely than their parents to settle for sun and golf in their retirement; they may prefer urban settings with lots of cultural life or to live nearer friends and families. That could mean higher demand -- and increased prices -- for housing in urban neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of this is just guesswork, though. "A lot of people have theories about the baby boomers," says Mr. Frey, the Brookings demographer, but boomers always have tended to confound expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dowell Myers, a professor of urban planning and demography at the University of Southern California, warns that the retirement of boomers over the next two decades is likely to depress house prices in many areas. As boomers relocate to retirement homes and cemeteries, there will be a lot more sellers than buyers in parts of the country, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's going to really mess up the housing market," says Mr. Myers. He predicts that this "generational correction" will be larger and longer-lasting than the current slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get a sense of the effects of aging boomers, Mr. Myers looks at the number of Americans 65 and over per 1,000 working-age people. He sees that number soaring to 318 in the year 2020 and 411 in 2030 from 238 in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people over 65 buy homes, of course, but as they get older they become more likely to sell than buy. People aged 75 to 79 are more than three times as likely to be sellers than buyers, Mr. Myers says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some areas, younger people will be happy to buy (and probably renovate) those boomer nests. The problem, Mr. Myers says, will be in places where lots of older people are selling and few young people are settling down. He says the effects will be strongest in the "coldest, most congested and most expensive states rather than the high-growth states of the South or West." Among the states where Mr. Myers sees downward pressure on prices within the next decade: Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York and Massachusetts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, applying demographic trends to house-price forecasts can be hazardous. Economists N. Gregory Mankiw and David Weil predicted in a paper in 1989 that demographic trends would lead to a "substantial" fall in real, or inflation-adjusted, home prices over the next two decades "if the historical relation between housing demand and housing prices continues." They reasoned that baby boomers were coming to the end of their prime house-buying years and that the smaller baby-bust generation would bring lower demand for housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That warning proved, at a minimum, premature. Despite the recent drop, the average U.S. home price is up about 35% in real terms since the end of 1989, according to the Ofheo index. Messrs. Mankiw and Weil both declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few people who invest in housing have time to follow these academic debates. For nearly four decades, Rich Sommer and his wife, Carolyn, have been investing in rental properties in and near Stevens Point, Wis. Mr. Sommer describes real estate as a good way "to get rich slowly." He and his wife, both former schoolteachers, gradually have built their net worth from zero to around $2.5 million through their rental properties. They have dealt with countless plumbing emergencies, evicted deadbeats and even once had to clean up after a suicide in one of their properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he hasn't been hit very hard by the real-estate crash, in part because the Midwest is much less vulnerable to booms and busts than coastal areas. When asked what he would do if someone handed him $1 million today, Mr. Sommer doesn't hesitate: He would put it into real estate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does it take to sell a house these days? A lot more than it used to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Free cars and speed boats, gas cards packed with thousands of dollars, personal-training sessions -- homeowners across the U.S. are resorting to imaginative ploys to reel in potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are trying whatever it takes," says Johnie Gary, a Realtor at Re/Max in Lago Vista, Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's a look at some of the more creative incentives that home sellers are using to get buyers to take notice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keys to the House...and Car</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph Moss, an investment-portfolio manager, prefers not to give anything away. But to attract potential buyers to his four-bedroom, 6,238-square-foot estate in Austin, Texas, he's giving the new owner a brand new Porsche Boxster, which retails for about $50,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The catch: "If you want to get the brand new Porsche," he says, "you have to pay the listing price." That's $2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Moss is quick to call the car giveaway a "gimmick," he says, he also hopes "a car lover would be attracted to the home because of the offering." He notes, for example, a family with a teenager recently stopped in to see the house. "That 16-year-old girl insisted [her parents] buy the house so she could get the car," he says, adding that "they may be back."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ready for a Dip</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a homeowner in Phoenix, Dennis Mavashev understands perfectly well the meaning of the phrase "sluggish housing market." According to Zillow.com, a Web site that tracks home values, home prices in the area fell more than 19% from July to September from a year earlier. That's why he's offering to install a pool, a patio and a professional grill should a new buyer want the amenities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if you don't want those goodies, Mr. Mavashev says, he'll knock $100,000 off the $1,495,000 price tag for a home that was built in 2006 and comes with six bedrooms, 6½ bathrooms and a three-car garage. "The market itself is so bad that it's hard to get people to even take a look at the area right now," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No Lawn Mower Needed</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you purchase Tim Newton's $700,000, three-bedroom home in LaHabra, Calif., you don't have to worry about the yard, at least for a while. That's because Mr. Newton will pay to professionally maintain the yard for six months. He'll also throw in a new washer and dryer. "A lot of people don't have their own lawn mowers until they can get set up for a while," he says. He adds that a new washer and dryer is a must, and he's also considering sweetening the deal with flat-screen TVs and furnishing the home for a new buyer. "Saving people a little time is pretty attractive," says Mr. Newton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Romance and Exercise</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For apartment shoppers in New York City, real-estate development company ORE International LLC offers buyers 10 personal-training sessions at any of its developments with gyms. Additionally, new owners will receive a $500 <span class="companylink">American Express</span> gift card for the holidays and a romantic getaway to the Old Drovers Inn, a historic upstate New York bed and breakfast. Finally, for a project near Prospect Park in Brooklyn, buyers receive free bicycles, says Boaz Gilad, ORE International's president. "The thought was that all the developers are giving discounts, but we wanted to be attractive, special and sexy," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Show Me the Green</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Shea Homes</span>, a real-estate developer in Scottsdale, Ariz., recently offered to install solar panels for buyers of homes in its Trilogy communities in Arizona, Florida, California and Washington. Previously, the company offered a Toyota Prius to buyers of its homes, which range in price from $180,000 to more than $1 million. Rick Andreen, president of <span class="companylink">Shea Homes</span> Active Lifestyle Communities, says that rather than wow consumers with big upfront discounts, the builder opted to lower buyers' ongoing payments. For instance, Mr. Andreen notes that a roof with solar panels can cut a household's electric bill by up to 60%. "We have seen a greater sensitivity to monthly payments," he says. "A big concession like a $20,000 discount is less impressive than these sorts of incentives."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How's Your French?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final tale comes from before things turned really sour -- but may hold lessons for today's market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Steve and Linda Hart put their newly built Mediterranean-style home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on the market for $7.4 million two years ago, they had a problem. No one wanted to buy the stylized Harbor Beach home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faced with mounting costs and a dearth of buyers, the Harts knew it was time to get creative. Not only did they advertise private beach club privileges, they also offered two $5,000 gift certificates to fill each closet in the master suite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then their real-estate agent sweetened the pot by offering an all-expenses-paid trip for two to France to the agent who delivered the home's next owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We got a lot of agents through the house," says Ms. Hart. "They suddenly had a great motivation to bring buyers in." The Harts' Realtor, Steve Kahn, figures he showed the house to roughly 300 to 400 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that helped, no doubt, but it was the final incentive -- dropping the price to $6.3 million -- that probably made the biggest difference. After that, it took just three weeks to find a buyer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faced with rising expenses -- and declining home values -- homeowners are finding creative ways to squeeze money out of their houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some are renting their place out to boarders, or to film crews who want to shoot commercials and movies on location. Others are cultivating crops in their backyard to peddle at farmers' markets, while some are installing solar panels on their roof and then selling the renewable-energy credits they get from the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter which course they choose, "rising costs have sent many homeowners scrambling for ways to stay afloat," says Marilyn Sullivan, a real-estate attorney in Arroyo Grande, Calif., who often counsels troubled homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's a look at four strategies homeowners are using to make ends meet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renting Out the House</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rental market has been flying high these days. As foreclosures mount, displaced homeowners are looking for someplace else to live -- and potential buyers are getting gun-shy about leaping into ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some cash-strapped homeowners are trying to use the situation to their advantage. Eric Thompson, a 39-year-old insurance salesman, recently moved out of his Richmond, Va., home and rented it to a couple of twentysomethings for $1,500 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I had to do something," Mr. Thompson says. "I have other bills to pay, and I can't afford them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Thompson bought the 1906 Victorian row house for $365,000 in 2005. He moved to the area to start an ice-cream franchise with his brother and sister-in-law. Two years later, he got a job offer in California and was ready to leave -- but found he couldn't unload his home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was on the market for six months and did not get one offer," Mr. Thompson says. He even tried reducing the price well below what he paid, but that didn't work, either. "In my neighborhood, it's been four months since the last home sold," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, Mr. Thompson found lodgers and moved back in with his parents in Santa Maria, Calif. They agreed to let him come home, as his situation appeared bleak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Thompson continues to worry about his bills, particularly his five-year adjustable-rate mortgage, which he says could cause his monthly payment to skyrocket if the interest rate on his loan adjusts upward in two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Location, Location, Location</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Sanford also knows a thing or two about contending with a pricey house payment. The 50-year-old London transplant pays about $9,000 a month to live in a 4,300-square-foot colonial clapboard house in Los Angeles, which comes equipped with four bedrooms and a tennis court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make his mortgage more affordable, Mr. Sanford rents out his home between 30 and 40 days a year to film studios. The house has shown up in commercials for the likes of <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart Stores Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Microsoft Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc</span>., as well as the movie "Transformers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sanford usually charges about $995 a day, although the price can shoot up as high as $5,000. All told, he says, he pulls in about $25,000 a year from the fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, not every homeowner -- or every home, for that matter -- is cut out for the movie business. "It's a big house, and I'm just one guy," he says. But, more important, "I'm not the kind of person that feels that my home is my castle."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the setup to work, Mr. Sanford says, you have to be willing to see people traipsing in and out of your home, alarming the neighbors, leaving scuff marks on the floor or chipping away at the paint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now he's thinking of getting out of the business -- but not because of those hassles. When he started renting his house, at the recommendation of friends in the film business, Mr. Sanford was also running a press agency at home. That helped him save on office space and allowed him to write off part of his mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he recently sold the business, so he's looking to sell his home, too. "I think I'll get less than I could have gotten last year," Mr. Sanford says. "But it doesn't make sense to hold onto this house without the offices in it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back to the Land</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin Barrett, a Scottish native living in Portland, Ore., didn't know the first thing about growing crops when he and his friend Dan Bravin discovered spin farming. The practice -- short for small plot intensive farming -- involves growing produce in nontraditional urban or suburban settings, and then selling it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite their lack of experience, the two were tilling soil and planting seeds in Mr. Barrett's 9,000-square-foot backyard in no time. Then they started to move beyond those confines, cultivating crops on other people's property and giving them fresh produce in return for the use of the space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Messrs. Barrett, 42, and Bravin, 38, sell people annual subscriptions to their produce for $350 a pop. Their business, City Garden Farms LLC, also peddles produce at farmers' markets throughout the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Before March 2008, I had never grown a vegetable in my life," says Mr. Barrett. "After six months, we grew in excess of 5,000 items for people."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From his property alone, Mr. Barrett estimates, the business has sold about $2,000 of produce collected over the 20- to 25-week harvest season from June to October. However, between buying seeds, farming tools and a refrigeration unit for his garage, Mr. Barrett says he and Mr. Bravin have just broken even.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next year will likely be more profitable, Mr. Barrett predicts. "We will probably double the number of subscriptions we sell," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Living Off the Grid</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Monica Ball and her husband, Bill, decided to hitch a 9,900-watt solar-panel system to their 4,000-square-foot home three years ago, they had some reservations. Even though the Sergeantsville, N.J., couple got a generous 70% subsidy from the state, they had to borrow $19,000 from their retirement savings to pay the balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In retrospect, however, "it was the best decision I ever made," says Ms. Ball, 43. Not only does the power from the panels help lower the family's utility bills, which Ms. Ball estimates used to total about $500 each month, the Balls also earn between $6,000 and $7,000 annually from the panels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's how it works. Each year, the state of New Jersey provides the Balls with Solar Renewable Energy Certificates, which represent the cost of offsetting pollution-generating energy. The Balls then sell the certificates for about $500 to $700 on the open market to brokers or electricity suppliers who are required to invest in solar energy under New Jersey's Renewable Portfolio Standards.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jon Hilsenrath and Sudeep Reddy </div><div>1510 words</div><div>2 December 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke laid out new steps the Fed might take to lift the economy, as the panel that monitors the U.S. business cycle said the nation has been in recession for a year -- the longest downturn in a quarter century</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Bureau of Economic Research said Monday that America entered recession in December 2007. Mr. Bernanke flagged the likelihood of further relief for the sagging economy at a speech in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More reductions in short-term interest rates are "certainly feasible," Mr. Bernanke said. But with the Fed's benchmark rate already at 1%, more cuts would bring the rate to near zero, prompting concern that the Fed would be out of recession-fighting ammunition. Mr. Bernanke sought to emphasize other steps the Fed might take to spur the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those steps could include an unusual attempt to bring down long-term interest rates by purchasing Treasury notes and bonds, something the Fed hasn't done since the early 1950s. Lower long-term rates would help bring down mortgage costs and other borrowing costs for businesses and individuals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A flurry of bearish news, including a decline in a key manufacturing-activity index, helped push the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 679.95 points Monday, or 7.7%, wiping out about half of last week's gains. It was the 12th-biggest single-day percentage drop and the fourth-sharpest point drop since the Dow was created in 1896.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke's comments helped stir more buying of longer-term Treasury bonds, to which investors already had been fleeing. The yield of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, already at its lowest level in more than 31 years, fell further, to 2.719%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The onslaught of troubling economic news also raises the chances that Democrats will push for a stimulus package during a lame-duck session of Congress this month, and make it more likely that President-elect Barack Obama will increase the size of the government-spending program he is designing. After the November election, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she favored a stimulus package of between $60 billion and $100 billion this year, followed by another round of spending next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Economic activity appears to have downshifted in the wake of the deterioration in financial conditions in September," Mr. Bernanke said in his speech. He pointed to a litany of soft spots: in the job market, household finances, exports and financial markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news is not all dire. The unemployment rate, at 6.5%, is rising but still well shy of its 7.8% level after the 1990-91 recession or the double-digit levels of the early 1980s. Mr. Bernanke also noted that falling oil prices have been a relief to households. But even that bright spot is related to the weak economy, since the global downturn is sapping demand for energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once financial markets manage to improve, the Fed chairman warned, "economic conditions will probably remain weak for a time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conventional rule of thumb is that a recession is two consecutive quarters in which the nation's gross domestic product contracts. The NBER, however, doesn't follow that formula. To pinpoint broad declines in activity, it considers a wide range of indicators in addition to overall economic output -- including payroll employment, industrial production, inflation-adjusted income and business sales activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many of these indicators, including monthly data on the largest component of GDP, consumption, have declined sharply in recent months," the NBER said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 12 months and counting, the downturn is already longer than the last two recessions in 2001 and 1990-91, both of which lasted eight months. If the current cycle persists past April, it would be the longest recession since the Great Depression. Downturns in the 1980s and 1970s lasted 16 months each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The economic outlook looks fairly bleak," said Harvard professor Jeffrey Frankel, who serves on the NBER's recession-dating committee, but said he wasn't speaking for the committee. "Forecasts that the trough would be sometime in the middle of next year don't strike me as especially pessimistic given the current situation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, economists surveyed by WSJ.com projected the recession would persist through the first quarter of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. GDP declined slightly in the fourth quarter of 2007 and third quarter of this year -- but increases in between have complicated the NBER committee's decisions. A separate measure of output, known as gross domestic income, peaked in last year's third quarter but also fluctuated until this year's third-quarter decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NBER committee focused primarily on employment, as it did in 2001, to pinpoint the recession's starting month. The expansion that followed the 2001 recession lasted 73 months, the NBER said, making it the shortest expansion in a quarter century. That expansion ended in December 2007, when U.S. payrolls peaked; they have been declining at an accelerating pace throughout this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We wait until we're sure that it is a recession," said Stanford economist Robert Hall, chair of the NBER recession-dating committee. Mr. Hall said the committee looks for "the depth, duration and dispersion" of the downturn before making a call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New data underscored the severity of the current downturn. The Institute for Supply Management's November manufacturing index, released Monday, fell to its lowest level since 1982. The ISM's new orders index -- a forward-looking indicator -- hit its lowest level since 1980, reaching 27.9 from 32.2 in October. That measure has fallen below 30 only three times in 60 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, construction spending posted a steeper-than-expected drop in October, according to government figures. The November employment report, due for release Friday, is expected to show nonfarm payrolls dropped in excess of 300,000 with a further increase in the unemployment rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke's comments set the stage for an important meeting of Fed policy makers in two weeks. The Fed's main lever to help an ailing economy -- short-term interest rates -- has already been pulled about as far as it can go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pushing down long-term interest rates could spur business and consumer demand, Mr. Bernanke said. Many consumer and business loans are closely linked to longer-term Treasury yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the 1940s, the Fed maintained a ceiling on long-term government bond yields at around 2.5%. It created ceilings on other government debt as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could bring down long-term rates now by purchasing Treasury bonds itself. A central bank has the capacity to effectively print money by injecting reserves into the banking system and could use the funds to buy securities like bonds. In normal times, this would be highly inflationary. But Mr. Bernanke noted that the recession is putting downward pressure on inflation now, which gives him flexibility to keep pressing with new measures to battle the recession. He also said the Fed would unwind its programs when the economy stabilizes, to help guard against inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed has already taken a big step toward targeting long-term interest rates. Last week, it said it would buy up to $600 billion in debt issued or guaranteed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, Ginnie Mae and Federal Home Loan Banks, all mortgage businesses with close tied to the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yields on debt tied to these firms have come down, a development that Mr. Bernanke said he found encouraging because it has helped to rein in mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Wall Street economists have argued that the Fed might also commit to keep short-term interest rates low for an extended period of time, something the central bank did in 2003 when it was worried about the weak economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such a move in theory could also bring down long-term interest rates. But Mr. Bernanke didn't raise it as an option in his speech. Some economists believe the move by the Fed in 2003 backfired and helped to spur the credit boom that is now unwinding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury Department could also take new steps. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that he is "working really hard" to implement existing initiatives and develop new ones. Congress has authorized the Treasury to invest up to $700 billion to bolster financial institutions. Mr. Paulson has put nearly half of that sum to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NBER makes judgments only on recessions and expansions in the U.S., but much of the rest of the global economy is in recession by other standards. The 15-nation euro zone, whose economy is second in size only to the U.S.'s, contracted in both the second and third quarters -- two-straight quarters of decline being the traditional definition of recession.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Grim economic data Monday showed more pain for U.S. manufacturing and construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, a key measure of U.S. manufacturing activity, said its overall index for last month moved to 36.2 from 38.9 in October and 43.5 in September. November's reading was the weakest since May 1982.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cliff Waldman, an economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI trade group, said the sharp drop "indicates that the rapidly declining U.S. and global economies have created a deep and worrisome slump in the U.S. manufacturing sector."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM report also showed payrolls shrank, with the employment index at 34.2 from 34.6. The new orders index dropped to 27.9 from October's 32.2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And another sign emerged of the dour economy's effect on inflation. The ISM prices index hit 25.5 in November from 37.0 -- the lowest reading since May 1949.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, Commerce Department data showed U.S. construction spending dropped more than expected during October. Total spending decreased by 1.2% at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.073 trillion compared with the prior month, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street had expected October construction spending would fall 1.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slumping housing sector has been a drag on the construction industry. Residential construction spending plunged 3.5% in October to $346.9 billion. Year over year, residential was 23.6% lower in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonresidential construction spending decreased by 0.1% last month. Outlays fell for roads, churches and power facilities while spending increased on hotels and office buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With economic conditions weakening and credit conditions seizing up, non-residential construction is likely to continue to wane," Insight Economics analyst Steven Wood said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-sector construction spending during October decreased by 2.0% to $756.5 billion. Spending climbed 0.4% in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public, or government, construction spending increased 0.7% to $316.1 billion. "Public construction activity is expected to soften in the quarters ahead because of increasing pressure on state and local government budgets," Mr. Wood said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kerry E. Grace and Sarah N.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices continued to fall as the economic downturn deepened in September, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price indexes and the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> home price index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The turmoil in the financial markets is placing further downward pressure on a housing market already weakened by its own fundamentals," Case-Shiller index committee chairman David Blitzer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the third quarter, the Case-Shiller national index posted a 16.6% decline in home prices from a year earlier, worse than the 15.1% drop posted in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices fell a seasonally-adjusted 1.8% in the third quarter from the previous quarter, according to a purchase-only house price index published Tuesday by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller indexes showed prices in 10 major metropolitan areas fell 18.6% in September from a year earlier and 1.9% from August. The drop marks the 10-city index's 12th-straight monthly report of a record decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 20 major metropolitan areas, home prices dropped 17.4% from the prior year, also a record, and 1.8% from August. None of the regions was able to stave off a decline from August to September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-to-month decliners were led by San Francisco, which fell 3.9%, and Las Vegas and Miami, which each fell 2.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the sixth-straight month, no region was able to avoid a year-over-year price drop. Phoenix and Las Vegas again posted the largest drops, falling 31.9% and 31.3%, respectively. Miami, Los Angeles and San Diego didn't fare much better, with declines of 28.4%, 27.6% and 26.3%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year-over-year, Dallas and Charlotte had the best relative performance, with declines of 2.7% and 3.5%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cleveland was the one market to show improvement in its year-over-year returns, reporting a price drop of 6.4%, compared with the 6.6% drop it reported in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller data came a day after a government report that sales of previously occupied homes resumed falling, dropping 3.1% in October, as the median price suffered its largest drop on record, and a week after new-home construction took its fourth tumble in a row for October, falling to a record low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the glut remains, as credit stays tight and the economic outlook remains bleak as mounting job losses have added another layer of stress on American households.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FHFA figure represents the largest decline in the 17-year history of the purchase-only index. It's also a steeper drop from the prior quarter, when home prices fell a seasonally-adjusted rate of 1.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year, as the housing crisis has worsened, prices fell 6.0% between the third quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2008. The purchase-only index represents data from repeat home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The impact of foreclosures and tightening credit conditions weighed heavily on house prices in the third quarter," said FHFA Director James B. Lockhart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lockhart said he hopes that a new foreclosure prevention effort unveiled earlier this month in conjunction with the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Housing Administration, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and HOPE NOW will help provide some relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Recent government actions to stabilize financial markets are aimed at countering the tight credit conditions affecting housing," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the latest data for the purchase-only index, the FHFA also unveiled some grim figures from its "all-transactions" house price index, which includes data from home sales and appraisals for refinanced homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency said that the index was down 2.7% in the latest quarter and down 4.0% over the four-quarter period. That four-quarter drop was also the largest drop in the history of the index, which dates back to 1975.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its purchase-only index, the FHFA found that prices fell in 41 states in the latest quarter. Nevada, California and Arizona were hit particularly hard, with those states seeing more than a 5% quarterly drop in prices. Eight other states, meanwhile, saw their quarterly home prices decline by more than 3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 20 ranked cities with the greatest price declines over the past four quarters, all but one were located in either California or Florida, the all-transactions house price index found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FHFA noted that while the national purchase-only house index price fell 6% between the third quarter of 2007 and 2008, the prices of other goods rose 6.7%. That translates into an inflation-adjusted home price drop of 12.7% over the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices continued their retreat in most areas in the third quarter," said FHFA Chief Economist Patrick Lawler. "While housing affordability has improved and may have drawn in some new buyers, it seems that high inventory levels and buyer uncertainty have had the dominant impact on prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both the FHFA's purchase-only and all-transactions house price indices track average house price changes in repeat sales or the refinancing of the same single-family properties. The purchase-only index is based on more than 5 million repeat sales transactions. The all-transactions index includes about 36 million repeat transactions. Both indices are based on data obtained from <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> for mortgages originated over the past 34 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span>'s Loss Widens</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another sign of the weakening housing market, <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>.'s fiscal fourth-quarter net loss widened sharply on $1.15 billion in impairment charges as the homebuilder posted its sixth straight quarterly loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chairman Donald R. Horton said market conditions deteriorated during our fourth fiscal quarter and October, "characterized by rising foreclosures, high inventory levels of both new and existing homes, increasing unemployment and eroding consumer confidence."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We continue to adjust our business to the current homebuilding environment by reducing our homes under construction and our owned lot position, controlling costs and repaying debt," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the quarter ended Sept. 30, the nation's largest residential builder by volume reported a net loss of $799.9 million, or $2.53 a share, compared with a prior-year net loss of $50.1 million, or 16 cents a share. The latest results included $1.15 billion in impairment charges. Last year's results included $318.6 million in charges for inventory impairments and other items.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> had said it expected a net loss of $800 million to $900 million amid more than $1.1 billion in pretax inventory impairments and write-offs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, the company also reported that home sales revenue fell by half to $1.5 billion on 6,961 homes closed. Land and lot sales revenue came in at about $200 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also had reported sales backlog of homes under contract fell 49% to 5,297. The company's cancellation rate -- which reflects sales orders canceled divided by gross sales orders -- was 47%. Net orders dropped 38% to 3,977 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> and other home builders have been suffering as the fallout of the subprime credit crunch continues to play out more than a year after it first began doing major damage. Home prices have plunged, and the glut of unsold homes continues to be a major headwind for the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have been working with potential buyers, enrolling them in programs that address problems including credit-report errors to managing debt, to raise their credit scores so they can qualify for a mortgage or a better interest rate, a sign the sector is desperate to unload inventory as the credit crisis causes lenders to shun borrowers with blemished credit histories.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 30-year home fixed-rate mortgage dropped below 6% on average this week, a seven-week low for the mortgage, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s weekly survey, released on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage averaged 5.97% for the week ended Nov. 26, down from last week's 6.04% average. The 30-year mortgage averaged 6.10% a year ago; it hasn't been lower since Oct. 9, when it averaged 5.94%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Interest rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell for the fourth consecutive week as signs the overall economy is flagging lowered most interest rates market-wide," said Frank Nothaft, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> chief economist, in a news release. "And economic growth in the third quarter was revised downward this week, led by the first decline in consumer spending since the fourth quarter of 1991 and the largest drop since the second quarter of 1980."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.74%, up slightly from last week's 5.73% average. The mortgage also averaged 5.73% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages averaged 5.86%, down from last week's 5.87% average. They also averaged 5.86% a year ago. And one-year Treasury-indexed ARMs averaged 5.18%, down from last week's 5.29% average. The ARMs averaged 5.43% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his comments, Mr. Nothaft pointed out that the combination of declining house prices and low mortgage rates has raised housing affordability in September to the highest level since February, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the price declines, sales of existing homes haven't picked up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mortgage Bankers Association reported in a separate survey that mortgage-application volume rose a seasonally adjusted 1.5% last week.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Activist investor William Ackman sees something in debt-laden mall owner <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties Inc</span>. that most others don't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ackman's hedge fund, <span class="companylink">Pershing Square Capital Management LP</span>, disclosed Tuesday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it bought nearly 20.1 million General Growth shares this month, giving it a 7.5% stake in the company. Pershing Square now ranks among the 10 largest shareholders of General Growth, which is based in Chicago and owns more than 200 U.S. malls. Mr. Ackman didn't return messages seeking comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors loved Pershing's move. General Growth's shares closed Tuesday at $1.36, up 36 cents, or 36%, in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock rose as high as $2 earlier in the day. It has declined 97% in the past year. General Growth warned this month that it might file for bankruptcy protection as it struggles to refinance and pay down its $27 billion debt load.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ackman has a history of buying stakes and agitating for managers to spin off or sell divisions to boost shares. He failed in 2005 and 2006 to persuade <span class="companylink">McDonald's Corp</span>. to spin off its real estate. He now is attempting to get <span class="companylink">Target Corp</span>. to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alexander's Swedish Tie</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alexander, an 88-unit tower developed by Alexander Gurevich, is going full steam ahead toward a spring 2009 completion. The tower, on New York's 49th Street near the United Nations, had its construction financing from <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>. Complicating matters, Lehman used the Alexander loan (along with 70 other property loans) as collateral for a $1.35 billion "repo" loan the investment bank had with <span class="companylink">Swedbank AB</span>, one of Scandinavia's largest lenders. So when Lehman collapsed, Swedbank inherited the Alexander's loan. At that time, it was unclear whether Swedbank would continue funding the partially built project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after a series of meetings, Mr. Gurevich and Swedbank came to an agreement. "We have, through a series of negotiations, convinced them to stay in the project and protect their loan. They are funding it," Mr. Gurevich said. Mr. Gurevich has Lehman loans or equity investments in two other projects that he still is working out. A Swedbank spokeswoman didn't return a request for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hired Hands at CBRE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some companies will gain from the losses of this financial crisis. Take, for example, real-estate broker C.B. Richard Ellis Group Inc., which recently landed a contract to act as a primary adviser to the U.S. government on handling and selling property held by failed banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CBRE, of Los Angeles, cinched the pact with the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>., which expects to seize more banks in the coming year. To wit, three banks failed Friday. CBRE and its subcontractors will handle the management, marketing and sales of residential and commercial properties that failed banks seized in the 50 states and U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CBRE representatives declined to say how many properties they expect to handle. CBRE named restructuring specialist Ken Pearson as its director for the FDIC account.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every few months, a gaggle of investors collectively ask, once again, if now is the time to buy home-building stocks. Since the sector peaked in early 2006, those with this inclination have been served up disappointment, time and again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, this is a hard habit to break, as the home builders have put together a multiday rally again, with Tuesday's gains built on news of the Federal Reserve's plan to buy mortgage-backed securities, which would presumably lower interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pair that with another sharp decline in housing prices, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Index, and the supposition is that maybe -- once again -- real estate has hit bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The only problem with that theory is that people are losing their jobs, the economy is weakening and there's over 10 months worth of supply in existing home sales," says Robert Pavlik, chief investment officer at Oaktree Asset Management. "I'd be leery, hesitant, suspect -- whatever word you want to use -- with some of these home builders because I still foresee better opportunities to get in."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SPDR Homebuilders ETF fund has gained 17% in the past three trading days, better than the gains posted by the broader market. And a faint trickle of optimism is seeping in among the research community, as <span class="companylink">UBS</span> analyst David Goldberg upgraded shares of Lennar to "buy" Tuesday, citing low valuation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the first time the stock has been upgraded to a buy rating since Sept. 23, and Mr. Goldberg says the stock is currently worth about 20% of its book value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of Lennar have underperformed an already-weak sector. The home builders have declined by 48% on the year, but Lennar has been worse, losing 64% on the year. The stock has bested its peers during this three-day rally, gaining 68% in just a few short days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notably, Mr. Goldberg's analysis doesn't depend on an incipient rebound in the housing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some may view the rapid decline in prices optimistically -- housing prices were down 17.4% in September from a year ago, according to S&amp;P/Case-Shiller -- but it poses a problem for the builders looking to unload inventory and competing with suddenly realistic sellers of existing homes, who are reducing their prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices could decline further over the next several months, which should improve affordability and widen the pool of available buyers," wrote analysts at FTN Midwest Securities. "The negative implication from the lower prices is increased competitiveness from resales and further asset impairments for all of our home builders."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing homes in the U.S. fell in October as the faltering economy kept buyers on the sidelines even as prices dropped by the most since records began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales declined by 3.1% to a 4.98 million annual rate from a 5.14 million annual pace during September, the National Association of Realtors said Monday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price plunged 11.3% to $183,300 in October from $206,700 a year earlier. That was the largest tumble since NAR records began in 1968.</p>

"The price movement suggests that prices are coaxing buyers into the market," said David H. Resler, managing director and chief economist at Nomura Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in the West -- the region that posted the steepest price declines in existing homes -- remained brisk, posting their strongest back-to-back months of results since January-February 2007, Mr. Resler said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of homes eased but remained substantial, with 4.23 million homes available for sale, down from 4.27 million. High inventories are exerting downward pressure on prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders have made it harder for some aspiring purchasers to borrow for a home. The Federal Reserve's latest quarterly survey of senior loan officers at U.S. banks showed about 70% said they tightened standards on prime mortgages in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With supply overhang still huge and mortgage financing tougher to obtain, home prices are likely to decline considerably further in the quarters ahead," Mr. Shapiro, of MFR, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from tighter loan standards and prices falling under the weight of high inventories, a weakening job market hasn't helped the housing market. The key nonfarm-payrolls number in the government monthly report on employment has gone down for 10 consecutive months; in October, it shrank by 240,000 jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average 30-year-mortgage rate was 6.2% in October, up from 6.04% in September, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year over year, sales of existing homes were down 1.6%. "A recovery in the housing market is unlikely until home prices stabilize," Insight Economics analyst Steven Wood said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin Feldstein's " How to Help People Whose Home Values Are Underwater [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122697004441035727.html]" (op-ed, Nov. 18) says homeowners have an "incentive to default," but this is based on flawed information in two respects. Most homeowner mortgages are not without recourse. It is unusual in most states for "no personal liability" language to appear in a deed of trust for a home loan. The practical reason that lenders rarely chase defaulting homeowners for deficiency judgments is that the search for assets is usually fruitless, and the homeowner has only to threaten bankruptcy to generally call off the lender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just because a homeowner has "negative equity" based on recent house price declines does not necessarily mean he is going to abandon the family home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "mortgage replacement loan" that Mr. Feldstein suggests is not workable from a practical standpoint. There are not enough appraisers in the country to decide on the current "value" of these houses. Even if there were, appraising some 12 million of them would lead to mistakes and abuses that would take years to sort out. Asking taxpayers to subsidize up to $156 billion in "equity loans" is not fair to those who bought a home or rented an apartment they could afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do we want government involved in renegotiating private contracts between individuals? Can't anyone see where this could lead down the road?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ed deZevallos</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houston</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin Feldstein proposes to offer full recourse loans to underwater homeowners based on the current value of the house, forgiving the higher outstanding loan. But why would a homeowner accept this offer? What if house prices decline further? In these perilous times that would place him one layoff away from losing, not only his house, but his car, retirement savings and other salable assets. I'd rather walk away from an underwater mortgage than take that risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Nelson</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chelmsford, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin Feldstein's proposal to help underwater homeowners sounds great in theory. However, recourse loans have not prevented tens of thousands of "owners" of Florida homes and condominiums, including thousands of investors who have substantial other assets, from walking away from their mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have a strong suspicion that the reason for this is that banks are not going after the income and assets of defaulting mortgage holders. Perhaps these bankers consider it too expensive or time consuming? In any event, the banks are looking to the U.S. taxpayer to restore their capital base, instead of seeking recourse from the many borrowers who in fact have the income and assets to repay some, if not all, of the mortgage debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regulators failed on the front end, when the exotic mortgages were made, and now they are apparently failing on the back end. Unless and until bank regulators require banks to seek recourse from defaulters on recourse mortgage debt, the U.S. taxpayer will bear the full burden of the banks' imprudent lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathleen Grant</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bradenton, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prof. Feldstein postulates that we should extend aid to people who are making their payments, sustaining a roof over their family's heads, but suffering the social embarrassment of being underwater on paper. What a droll idea! Perhaps next he'll consider subsidies to those whose 401(k) plans have gone temporarily south, or those whose liberal arts degree is devalued. The rise and fall of real estate values is a given. Just as these houses are slipping in price now, so they were skyrocketing a few years back. I don't recall seeing Barney Frank calling for windfall profits taxes on "obscene" home profits, nor wanting to tax the untold millions of equity pulled out and spent on SUVs, cruises and other depreciable assets.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Struggling U.S. auto makers left Washington empty-handed after weeks of pleading for a handout, but that hasn't deterred home builders from stepping up to lobby Congress for help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But any federal assistance would require policy makers to figure out how to stimulate demand for housing -- the problem at the root of the global financial meltdown -- without artificially propping up home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The builders' lobby is ramping up its sales pitch for a $250 billion stimulus package called "Fix Housing First," arguing that financial markets won't recover until home prices stop falling. They are calling for a generous tax credit for home purchases and a federal subsidy that would lower a homeowner's mortgage rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress resisted a similar effort to pass a larger tax credit earlier this year, instead creating a $7,500 credit for new-home purchases that had to be paid back over 15 years, effectively extending an interest-free loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are promoting the campaign with full-page newspaper advertisements, but face an uphill battle, with critics suggesting the proposal is too expensive and that it too heavily promotes home purchases rather than addressing loan modifications for delinquent homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effort aims to stop the adverse feedback loop gripping the market. The cycle begins when falling home prices prompt some borrowers to default, leading to foreclosures. That further depresses home prices, hitting the banks that hold mortgage-backed securities, causing them to pull back and freeze credit. That in turn causes the economy to slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The basic asset that is underlying all the financial problems that we're experiencing is highly unstable, and it's causing an ongoing hemorrhaging in the financial system," said David Ledford, who oversees housing finance and policy for the National Association of Homebuilders. "It's starting to snowball."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homebuilders' proposal would offer home buyers a tax credit equal to 10% of the home's value, capping it at $22,000, nearly three times the $7,500 credit Congress offered to new buyers earlier this year. Builders say the earlier credit didn't work because it wasn't big enough and had to be repaid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders also want subsidies for interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages for government-backed "conforming" loans, which currently are around 6.2%, to bring rates down to 3% for loans made in the first half of 2009 and 4% for those in the second half of the year. Realtors are pushing a 4.5% interest-rate buy-down for new loans. Lawrence Yun, the chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, estimates that each 1% decline in interest rates could generate between 500,000 and 800,000 home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rate reduction of about 1% on a 30-year mortgage typically costs the lender -- in this case the government -- around 4% of the principal. So a 2% buy-down on a $200,000 mortgage would cost $16,000. The NAHB estimates the subsidy portion of its proposal would cost the Treasury $143 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to some economists, "Fix Housing First" strikes an all-too-familiar refrain of "build more homes." Housing economist Thomas Lawler implores builders to "stop building." He and others argue that effectively setting a floor for home prices will prolong the pain because it will keep supply and demand out of sync.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The government does not have the tools to rewrite the laws of supply and demand," said Harvard University economist Edward Glaeser. "By artificially increasing prices, we are encouraging more building."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homebuilders frequently point to a similarly structured tax credit and interest-rate subsidy that Congress approved in 1975. The program gave qualified buyers a 5% credit up to $6,000 and bought down interest rates by around 1.5%, to 7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a historical parallel could be misleading. In 1975, the U.S. was exiting -- not entering -- a recession, one induced by oil prices, and not a sharp run-up in housing prices. "You can offer people all sorts of credits, but if they don't have a job or income I don't know that they're going to take the bait," said Jared Bernstein of the Economic Policy Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another potential hitch is that creating an incentive to buy, but not a mechanism to refinance existing mortgages, could prompt some people to purchase a new home on more favorable terms and then bail on their existing one. However, banks -- along with mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> -- have tightened restrictions on buying second homes to guard against such a maneuver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even critics of the proposal, however, worry that home prices could continue falling to below historical averages for a normal market. "The biggest question is, will there be an overshoot to the downside because of tightening mortgage credit and a declining prices on foreclosed homes," Mr. Lawler said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the debate hinges on how much further economists believe home prices have to adjust before they are in line with historical norms relative to income. Mr. Yun, of the realtors' group, said the NAR's "Affordability Index" shows that most markets have returned to their pre-bubble levels, though he said some of the most overheated markets still have a ways to readjust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, the government has taken steps to subsidize the mortgage market by approving larger loan limits for <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and the Federal Housing Administration, which together account for more than eight-in-10 new loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other critics say that while a large tax credit could motivate buyers to get off the fence, it would do nothing for homeowners unable to refinance mortgages they can't afford, which is arguably a bigger problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One idea with broader support -- but with a potentially bigger price tag -- is an interest-rate buy-down that would allow existing homeowners to refinance to lower rates. Chris Mayer, senior vice dean of Columbia Business School, has suggested that the government push interest rates down to 5.25% for homeowners who prove that they can afford to live in their new homes and can document their income.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Christina S.N. Lewis </div><div>585 words</div><div>21 November 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In jail and owing millions, former quarterback Michael Vick has cut the price of his luxury Atlanta home to $4.1 million, from $4.5 million, after a year on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile in rural Virginia, the house where Mr. Vick hosted the dog-fighting ring that proved his undoing is headed back to the auction block on Dec. 12 -- at a reduced minimum price of $590,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, developer Wilbur Ray Todd Jr. bought the 4,600-square-foot Surrey County house, on 15 acres, from Mr. Vick for $450,000, intending to remodel it and sell it for $1 million at a Dec. 15 auction. But he failed to get a suitable offer. Local agent Kyle Hause, of <span class="companylink">Long &amp;Foster Real Estate</span>, and Motley's Auction and Realty Group, of Richmond, are handling this year's auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the Atlanta house, in 2005 Mr. Vick -- then one of the NFL's brightest rising stars -- paid $3.78 million for the newly built eight-bedroom home in the Sugarloaf Country Club area with lake views, a sauna, home theater, outdoor fireplaces and a double-height entrance foyer with a curved staircase. Atlanta's Funari Realty has the listing. Last year, Mr. Vick pleaded guilty to federal charges and is serving a 23-month prison sentence in Kansas. He remains suspended from the Atlanta Falcons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rescued dogs have had their own television special, live on a Utah animal sanctuary (with their care financed by $928,000 from Mr. Vick), and have their own wine brand: Vicktory Dogs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cage Lists, Withdraws</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicolas Cage's latest listing of a luxury residential property was almost -- as one of his movies put it -- "Gone in Sixty Seconds."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Nov. 12, the Academy Award-winning actor and owner of a portfolio of properties listed an apartment in midtown Manhattan for $9.75 million. A week later, the home was listed as temporarily off the market on a broker listing service, shortly after a reporter inquired about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 48th-floor condominium comprises two adjacent apartments, totaling 3,550 square feet with three bedrooms, three bathrooms and one powder room, according to listing information. The Web site showed sleek, low-slung white furniture and floor-to-ceiling windows. In 2004 and 2005, Mr. Cage paid $5.5 million for the apartments. Cordelia Robb, of Brown Harris Stevens had the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cage is trying to sell several of his luxury properties, including a Bel Air, Calif., house for $30 million and a home in Rhode Island for $15.9 million. He didn't respond to attempts to reach him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida Ranch, $50 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Florida cattle and quail-hunting ranch, half-owned by a onetime top pick in the National Football League draft, has gone on the market for $50 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 5,000-acre Flying G Ranch is near Okeechobee, about 60 miles northwest of West Palm Beach, and can accommodate 1,000 cattle. There's a five-bedroom lodge (left), cottages and a helipad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-owner Tucker Frederickson, the top NFL pick in 1965, was selected by the New York Giants, but injuries forced him to retire early and pushed him into a career in stock-brokerage and real estate. The other owner is real-estate developer Stephen Myers. William McDavid, of ranch broker Hall &amp;Hall, has the listing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Potomac, Md. -- Ernesto Stein and Margaret Miller liked their suburban neighborhood a lot more than their cookie-cutter house. Their three daughters were squeezed into one bedroom; all five family members shared a second-floor bathroom and watched television in what was supposed to be the master bedroom. Yet the couple, both economists, recoiled at the cost and waste of tearing down what they had and starting from scratch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the family turned to Mark McInturff, a nationally recognized architect who has found a healthy business melding modernism onto existing, traditionally designed homes. A few years and around $500,000 later, the Stein/Miller family is still in their suburban neighborhood, but in a light-filled space connected by a metal bridge to a 29-foot-tall corrugated metal and mahogany tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Topping the tower is the new master bedroom, which with its ceiling-to-floor windows glows above neighboring rooflines. "We really should get some blinds," says Ms. Miller, who estimates that building a house might have cost the family twice as much as their addition did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House additions are hardly a new phenomenon. But the moribund housing market, as well as growing environmental consciousness, is creating new momentum behind efforts to give homes a completely different look without starting over. The phenomenon is particularly evident in the Washington, D.C., area, reflecting the region's lack of buildable lots and preservation laws that can make it difficult to obtain building permits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have projects that are just coming online now because the clients were savvy enough to wait for the downturn," says Kendall Dorman, another Washington architect known for his modern add-ons. Half of Mr. McInturff's business involves modern additions as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hugh Newell Jacobsen, considered a pioneer of modern add-ons, warns that many, if not most, stabs at modern additions are unsuccessful from a design standpoint. In inexperienced hands, tacking a tower onto a ranch home can go very wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building dramatic design statements can create additional headaches. Originally budgeted at $180,000, the cost of the Stein/Miller addition more than doubled, reflecting in part changes made to better integrate the two structures. One contractor, befuddled by the project's complexity, pulled out entirely. The couple squabbled over some choices, like the cost of using safety glass in the windows. Luckily, the family had relocated to Boston during a year of construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some neighbors expressed concern about the addition's visual impact on their tree-lined street. Kathleen Lennon, a 46-year-old graphic designer, says she really likes the design of the house but "personally wouldn't have put up something so big." The green space is "one of the reasons we chose to live here," she adds. Ms. Miller says they were particularly careful to avoid increasing their house's footprint very much for that reason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately, the cost and aggravation appears to have paid off. Architects including Mr. Jacobsen have cited Mr. McInturff's work as some of the best examples of the movement. And perhaps more importantly, the family says the result for them has been a more relaxed life. The girls, ages 6, 8, and 11, love having their own bedrooms and the family has a living area to watch television.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stein, the 47-year-old regional economic adviser at the Inter-American Development Bank, and Ms. Miller, a 45-year-old senior economist at the World Bank, purchased their awkwardly laid-out three-bedroom home in 1996 for $350,000. But while space grew tight, the run-up in home prices meant they couldn't afford to buy bigger in their neighborhood unless it was a fixer-upper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in a neighborhood dominated by four dated cookie-cutter models, the couple realized they were as interested in better design as more space. "We wanted something functional but not huge," says Mr. Stein. He longed for a house like the one where he grew up in Buenos Aires -- an airy place with big windows where his family spent a lot of time lounging by the pool and grilling for guests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That vision dovetailed nicely with that of Mr. McInturff, who hews closely to the modernist vision of trying to erase the boundaries between outside and in. In creating what he dubs "hybrid houses," the architect says he regularly removes walls and external structures, a process he describes as "designing with an eraser as much as a pencil."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Stein/Miller house, Mr. McInturff erased the walls separating the narrow galley kitchen, the master bedroom/TV room and the living and dining room. He also added windows, making it possible to see the outside from anywhere on the first floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the tower makes the biggest statement. A bridge connected to the house's second floor leads directly to the master bedroom; a screened-in porch below holding a teak dining table is where the family now eats in the warmer months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also the family's new favorite hangout. "It is spectacular, with beautiful bold colors, and windows of different shapes that bring the outside in," says Mr. Stein. All three children wish they could sleep there. "It's the nicest room in the world," says 11-year-old Katherine.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is your home may be worth more than the rock-bottom price that your neighbors' houses fetched. The bad news: No one but you might think so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one point of widespread agreement in the real-estate industry is that there is no single accurate index of home prices. They are all over the map, cover different sets of homes and may exclude parts of the country or be unduly influenced by the mix of homes sold in a given month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the home market surged earlier this decade, the two leading indicators of home prices diverged. One didn't count homes sold with exotic or subprime mortgages, which fueled much of the bubble. These same properties are often the ones going on the auction block today at severe discounts, pulling the other home-price index down -- some say to unrealistic lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To address these discrepancies, indexes are going increasingly local. Other, less-well-known measures of home prices -- some of them available only to paying customers -- are adjusting to exclude homes sold by banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of foreclosures and other distressed properties accounted for 35% to 40% of transactions in the third quarter, the National Association of Realtors said this week. The discount on such properties, often sold by banks that need to clear inventory quickly, can be 30% to 40% compared with similar properties sold by the resident, according to Damien Weldon, a vice president of credit-risk products and analytics at First American CoreLogic. The company's Loan Performance division is producing a new index without these discounted sales, a distinction that was "not important a few years ago, but now it's very important," Mr. Weldon says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers from home-price indexes are widely watched. The Federal Reserve uses them to measure the value of housing stock. Banks use them to determine whether mortgages are underwater and to estimate the value of homes they will have to sell after foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the indexes may be leading everyone astray. Just as respondents to election surveys are meant to stand in for the broader electorate, the homes being sold need to represent all homes. The problem is, producers of these price measures aren't sure that sale prices reflect the values of houses not on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People put all their eggs in the sales-price basket," says Andrew Leventis, a senior economist with the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>, which produces a home-price index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Whether the transaction pool is reflective of the entire housing stock -- nobody addresses that problem," adds Karl Case, professor of economics at Wellesley College and co-creator of the Case-Shiller Index, a competitor to the federal government's measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller index includes properties that had subprime loans attached.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's the stuff that went down most substantially, and that's probably the stuff that went up most substantially," Prof. Case says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal index, though, doesn't include such properties, instead accounting only for properties with financing from mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. For that reason, many prefer Case-Shiller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I believe S&amp;P Case-Shiller for the areas it covers," says Thomas Lawler, a housing economist in Leesburg, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Case-Shiller has shown a steeper decline in markets with many distressed sales. The second-quarter year-over-year declines in San Francisco, Phoenix and Las Vegas ranged from 23% to 28%, according to Case-Shiller. But the federal gauge recorded declines of only 5.8%, 11% and 18%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone thinks the Case-Shiller index is useful. Richard A. Smith, chief executive of real-estate broker <span class="companylink">Realogy Corp</span>., says the index omits 13 states. "Case-Shiller as a broad index is inaccurate," Mr. Smith says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>, which publishes Case-Shiller, responds that "the sampling and data collection is as good as it can be."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One's got to be wrong," Mr. Smith said of the dueling Case-Shiller and federal indexes. "Nobody will know until the book is written."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet there is no surefire way to know which index got closer to the truth. Each year since 2000, the Census Bureau has asked homeowners to report the value of their home, but "it doesn't necessarily jibe with assessment records or anything like that," says Jeanne Woodward, a Census Bureau statistician.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another potential check on values is home appraisals. But Dr. Leventis said there are two possible sources of upward bias. One is that people often choose to get their homes appraised when they figure the value has risen sharply and they can convert some of that to cash with a refinancing. Another is that appraisals tend to overstate the value of homes, perhaps because homeowners seek the most-favorable assessment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I really don't see a benchmark" against which to check these home-price indexes, says Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His group releases its own numbers, most recently showing prices declining by 9% in the third quarter compared with a year earlier. But that measure, unlike the others, doesn't take into account a home's sales record. So instead of comparing each property's sale price to its prior sale price, the realtors group compares the price of homes sold this month with that of homes sold last month -- even if the mix of homes has changed sharply. Mr. Yun defends the measure as "very simple to understand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the numbers that get headlines are based on metropolitan areas. Yet the housing-market picture can vary dramatically within the same region. Lynn, Mass., a suburb northeast of Boston, saw prices drop 10% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, according to Wellesley's Prof. Case. Yet in the same period prices in Cambridge, just west of the city, rose 13%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Integrated Asset Services, or IAS, sells estimates by neighborhood. "We are a lot more granular" than Case-Shiller and the federal index, Chief Executive David McCarthy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within Middlesex County, which includes Cambridge, one neighborhood was up 12% compared with a year earlier in September, while two others were down 1% and 2%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Fiserv Inc</span>. uses the Case-Shiller local numbers to sell estimates for a single property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risk when going local is that data become sparse and a few anomalous sales may throw things off -- particularly in markets where most of the sales are distressed. IAS makes estimates based on as few as 50 to 75 transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of this nuance is captured in headlines about the latest home-price-index release, Prof. Case complains. Still, he is hopeful that home-price indexes will improve. "This new criticism that these indexes are showing different things is going to lead to a lot of research," he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harsh reality</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">of housing glut</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. construction starts</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">could remain depressed</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">into 2012, agency says</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have been watching closely for a bottom in housing starts. Once that happens, when will home builders be able to ramp up again?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best-case scenario in a Congressional Budget Office report is a turnaround in construction by the end of 2009. The agency's "pessimistic" outlook is a "housing depression" in which housing starts don't recover to typical levels until 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either way, the near-term drivers of housing demand are shaky. Net immigration slipped to one million last year, down from 1.1 million to 1.2 million annually between 2002 and 2006. Further declines are likely if the U.S. gets mired in recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, rising unemployment could keep many renters from buying homes, despite falling prices. On the supply side, banks are dumping foreclosures on the market, competing directly with home builders for scarce buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Demographics aren't going to drive housing for quite a while," says Joshua Shapiro, an economist at consulting firm MFR. "There's so much inventory out there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect the Census Bureau to report Wednesday that housing starts fell 4.5% last month to an annual rate of 779,000, down from 817,000 in September. The National Association of Home Builders said Tuesday that builder-sentiment measure fell in November to the lowest point since the survey began in 1985.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so much gloom in the air, Congress ought to listen hard to the pessimists before deciding how to resuscitate the housing market. Tax breaks and loan modifications might be tasty tonics, but they aren't quick fixes for the U.S. housing glut.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumer prices plunged in October, wiping out any remaining concerns about inflation and underscoring the weakness of the nation's economy. Falling prices, combined with a loss of real-estate and stock-market wealth, are prompting concerns about potential deflation -- a phenomenon last seen in the U.S. during the Great Depression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said its index of consumer prices dropped by nearly a full percentage point in October from the previous month, following no change in September and a small 0.1% drop in August. It was the largest monthly drop since monthly records began in 1947 and was driven by a substantial decline in energy prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling prices also were seen in a wide range of goods and services, with lodging, apparel, computers and motor vehicles among those items posting lower prices in October. So-called core prices, which exclude energy and food to gauge underlying inflation, declined by 0.1% -- the first monthly drop since 1982.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even during the deflation scare in the early 2000s the core CPI never fell by this much," said economists at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Core prices are up just 2.2% from a year ago, closer to the 1.5%-2% range Federal Reserve policy makers view as price stability after posting gains this summer as oil prices surged to record highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deflation would become a more serious concern if companies and consumers were to delay purchases because they expect prices to fall. The lower demand would threaten to push prices down further, leading firms to cut employment and other costs. That in turn would push the overall economy down, reinforcing a cycle of defaulting mortgages and financial-sector turmoil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Donald Kohn Wednesday said the risk of deflation in the U.S. is bigger than a few months ago but "still small."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed officials spent most of the year worrying about inflation getting out of control as prices for oil and other commodities soared. With the reversal in commodity prices since the summer, they are now bracing for inflation readings to turn negative for at least several months next year. But they don't believe deflation -- a generalized decline in prices -- is likely to turn into a serious risk because of aggressive Fed actions coupled with a significant fiscal-stimulus program next year to prop up the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bolstering the economy is the primary way to prevent that cycle from worsening. The Fed has already lowered its interest-rate target sharply, to 1% from 5.25% in mid-2007, and conceivably could go as low as zero. The declines seen so far in consumer and producer prices certainly give the Fed more leeway in lowering interest rates without stoking inflation. Economists expect the Fed will cut rates again at its Dec. 16 policy meeting, perhaps slicing the 1% rate in half as the risk of a serious U.S. recession continues to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central-bank officials also have numerous other options they can deploy to stimulate the economy and fight deflation if short-term interest rates head toward zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Ben Bernanke became Fed chairman, he said earlier this decade that a "relatively straightforward extension of current procedures" would be to stimulate spending by lowering longer-term interest rates. The Fed could do that by committing publicly to holding its rate target low for an extended period, as it signaled earlier this decade when its rate target was 1% and the deflation risk last emerged. Mr. Bernanke, however, said he prefers instead to announce explicit interest-rate ceilings for longer-maturity Treasury debt and purchase those securities at prices that would enforce the ceiling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond supporting fiscal stimulus and influencing longer-term rates, the Fed also can fight deflation by flooding the financial system with liquidity. The central bank received new authority last month to expand its balance sheet broadly to allow that. As a result, the Fed has been maintaining overnight interest rates at well below its stated 1% target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic concerns were compounded by a Commerce Department report showing new-home construction fell by 4.5% in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 791,000, the lowest level since the series began in 1947. Newly filed building permits also fell sharply, by 12% to a level of 805,000, the lowest in a quarter-century and a sign that new-home construction could continue to fall in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The near-halt in housing activity is likely to be a significant drag on U.S. economic growth in the current and coming quarters, as it was earlier this year. But given the current glut of housing inventory, these low levels of new-home construction are also considered to be a needed part of the housing correction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of new single-family homes is down by 38% from a year ago. Regional data, which are often volatile month to month, show construction fell 31% in the Northeast from the previous month, and by 13.7% in the Midwest. Construction rose by 1.5% in the South and by 7.5% in the West.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Treasury prices were mostly higher, led by longer-term debt, after a pair of government reports showed that U.S. consumer prices dropped the most ever for a single month and that housing starts fell to a low in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In midmorning trade, two-year notes were down 3/32 point, to 100 20/32, to yield 1.1739%. The 10-year note was up 23/32 point, to 102 16/32, to yield 3.4518%. Bond prices move inversely to yields. Ten-year-note yields earlier touched the lowest since Oct. 6. Benchmark 10-year notes have gained for two days as economic data pointed to inflation risks in a deep freeze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consumer price index declined 1% last month, compared with a median estimate of economists for a 0.9% drop. Excluding food and energy, prices declined 0.1%, the first drop in the core CPI since 1982.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks fell sharply Wednesday, led by financial shares, after another grim housing report and a record drop in consumer prices offered little cheer to investors fretting about the fate of the Big Three auto makers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed below 8000, falling 427.47 points, or 5.1%, to 7997.28, its lowest close since March 31, 2003. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500-stock index fell 52.4 points, or 6.1%, to 806.58. The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 96.85 points, or 6.5%, to 1386.42.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data showed that residential construction tumbled last month, with housing starts falling 4.5% and building permits dropping 12%. Housing-market weakness is hurting banks and other companies that are stuck with bad bets tied to mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other economic news was grim. The Federal Reserve released the minutes of its interest-rate committee's late-October meeting, which showed that officials are expecting the U.S. economy to contract through at least the first half of 2009. Officials made clear that "unfolding economic developments" could require the Federal Open Market Committee "to further lower its target for the federal-funds rate in the future and to review the adequacy of its liquidity facilities."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> was down 23% in late trading. The bank announced it will purchase the final $17.4 billion of assets still in structured investment vehicles as it unwinds its exposure to such off-balance-sheet entities. Analyst David Trone of Fox-Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia Waller sharply cut his price target and earnings outlook for <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, which he had already rated at "underweight."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insurers, which have been scrambling to garner a bigger share of the government money set aside for the financial industry, also dropped. <span class="companylink">Hartford Financial Services Group</span> plunged 27%. <span class="companylink">Prudential Financial</span> fell 12%, <span class="companylink">MetLife</span> slid 6.3%, <span class="companylink">American International Group</span> sank 16% and Lincoln National fell 39%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">General Motors</span> tumbled 14% as the company's chief executive, testifying to Congress for a second day along with his counterparts from <span class="companylink">Ford Motor</span> and Chrysler, tried to make the case for the government extending a bridge loan to their industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's very disconcerting to the man on the street to see these corporate icons having such massive problems," said Randy Bateman, chief investment officer for Huntington Funds. "People are really having to re-evaluate entire investment programs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil companies were hurt as crude futures fell 77 cents a barrel, or 1.4%, to $53.62 on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>. U.S. crude inventories rose for an eighth consecutive week, the Energy Information Administration reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> said in a report that crude prices could fall to $40 a barrel by April as demand sinks and production becomes more cost-effective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Sunoco</span> dropped 13% after <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> downgraded the refiner to sell from hold, while Hess fell 9.2%. <span class="companylink">Chevron</span> declined 3.8% and <span class="companylink">Exxon Mobil</span> slipped 4%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jon Hilsenrath and Kelly Evans </div><div>950 words</div><div>20 November 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumer prices in October registered their largest single-month decline since before World War II, a broad-based drop that creates a new challenge for policy makers: avoiding a bout of deflation, a prolonged period of falling prices throughout the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The odds of such an event are still considered small by most economists. But the mere risk puts added pressure on Congress and the incoming Obama administration to quickly advance a large fiscal stimulus plan. It also increases the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will take steps -- such as pushing interest rates lower -- to boost sagging consumer and business demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At their last meeting in October, Fed policy makers sharply downgraded their estimates for economic growth, according to minutes of the meeting released Wednesday. Some officials concluded more rate cuts could be needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about deflation Wednesday, Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn said at the Cato Institute that the risk, while slight, has increased. "Whatever I thought that risk was four or five months ago, I think it's bigger now, even if it is still small," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A true bout of deflation would pose problems on several fronts. First, it would raise real borrowing costs for individuals and businesses. That's because both must repay fixed amounts of debt, along with interest, even as underlying prices and their own earning power are falling. It could also give households and businesses an incentive to hoard cash, since the value of having cash on hand rises as prices fall. The process can feed on itself: Consumers and businesses delay spending, worsening a downturn and leading to more debt defaults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, the Labor Department said its consumer price index fell by 1% from September on a seasonally adjusted basis. It was the largest decline for as long the government has been using seasonal adjustments, which account for regular seasonal swings in the data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharply falling energy prices were the main cause -- a fact that provides some comfort to policy makers. Lower energy prices are a boon to consumers. And because energy is so volatile, it is widely seen as a poor indicator of long-term inflation trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices declined in other arenas, including hotel charges, apparel and cars. Excluding food and energy prices, prices fell 0.1% for the month, the first drop since 1982.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over a time span of longer than one month, the U.S. is still well beyond the grip of deflation. In October the consumer price index was up 3.5% from a year earlier, compared to a 5.6% year-on-year increase three months ago. Core prices, excluding food and energy, were up 2.2% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> economists project that among developed countries, consumer prices will fall in the coming quarters, with the U.S. outpacing other countries. That's largely due to falling energy prices. Excluding food and energy, inflation is expected to decelerate sharply, but remain positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic concerns were compounded Wednesday by a Commerce Department report showing new-home construction fell 4.5% in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 791,000, the lowest level since the series began in 1947.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge for policy makers is to stimulate demand, something lower interest rates often achieve. But the Fed can't push its target interest rate below zero to battle deflation. That means the central bank would have to take other steps. With the fed funds rate now targeted at 1%, and on most days trading below that, the target rate is already near the zero-bound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kohn said the lesson of Japan, which struggled to tame deflation in the 1990s and earlier this decade, was that "we should be very aggressive" about combating the threat. He added that contingencies for the problem should be considered, should that "still remote possibility" become more real.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke has written extensively about combating deflation over the years, and has argued that despite the challenges, the central bank is well-positioned to ensure it can be avoided.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an effort to bolster the economy, the Fed has already lowered the Fed funds rate -- a key rate banks charge each other for overnight loans -- from 5.25% in mid-2007, and is widely expected to lower it again at the Fed's next meeting December 16.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In papers and speeches before he became Fed chairman, Mr. Bernanke laid out additional steps the Fed could take to stimulate the economy and fight deflation as short-term interest rates head toward zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has already taken one of those steps -- sharply expanding its own balance sheet -- in effect pumping cash into the banking system and increasing its own extension of loans and holdings of assets. Since late August, the Fed's balance sheet has grown from $880 billion to more than $2 trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed could also seek to stimulate demand by lowering longer-term interest rates, which have a more direct effect on activity such as mortgage borrowing and business investment than the very short-term Fed funds rate that the central bank targets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke has said he would prefer to push long-term rates down by announcing explicit interest-rate ceilings for longer-maturity Treasury debt, something the Fed did for nearly a decade until 1951. It could enforce such a ceiling by purchasing longer-dated Treasury bonds, or other bonds such as debt issued by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Buying the bonds could push up their prices and their yields down.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have been watching closely for a bottom in housing starts. Once that happens, when will home builders be able to ramp up again?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best-case scenario in a Congressional Budget Office report is a turnaround in construction by the end of 2009. The agency's "pessimistic" outlook is a "housing depression" in which housing starts don't recover to typical levels until 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either way, the near-term drivers of housing demand are shaky. Net immigration slipped to one million last year, down from 1.1 million to 1.2 million annually between 2002 and 2006. Further declines are likely if the U.S. gets mired in recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, rising unemployment could keep many renters from buying homes, despite falling prices. On the supply side, banks are dumping foreclosures on the market, competing directly with home builders for scarce buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Demographics aren't going to drive housing for quite a while," says Joshua Shapiro, an economist at consulting firm MFR. "There's so much inventory out there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect the Census Bureau to report Wednesday that housing starts fell 4.5% last month to an annual rate of 779,000, down from 817,000 in September. The National Association of Home Builders said Tuesday that builder-sentiment measure fell in November to the lowest point since the survey began in 1985.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so much gloom in the air, Congress ought to listen hard to the pessimists before deciding how to resuscitate the housing market. Tax breaks and loan modifications might be tasty tonics, but they aren't quick fixes for the U.S. housing glut.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Maya Jackson Randall </div><div>734 words</div><div>18 November 2008</div><div>15:30</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home builders' confidence in the market has plunged to a record low amid overwhelming uncertainty about the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, home prices fell in a record four out of five U.S. cities in the third quarter as low-cost foreclosures flooded the market and the U.S. housing market's decline spread.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Home Builders released results Tuesday of a monthly survey of builders' thoughts on market prospects. Its latest, November, index for sales of new, single-family homes tumbled into single-digit territory, dropping to 9 from the previous record low of 14 in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November's five-point drop to 9 puts the index at its lowest level since the series was created in January 1985.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today's report shows that we are in a crisis situation," said NAHB Chairman Sandy Dunn, a home builder from West Virginia. "If there's any hope of turning this economy around, Congress and the [Bush] Administration need to focus on stabilizing housing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dunn said uncertainty about the economy has driven consumers from the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's going to take some major incentives to bring them back," she said. She argued that Congress should pass new economic stimulus legislation that includes new home-buying incentives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another component within the housing market index, present sales of single-family homes, also fell, dropping to 8 from 14 in October. It measures current sales conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The traffic of prospective buyers slipped significantly, too, down to 7 from 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Congress should consider significant consumer incentives such as expanding the first-time home buyer tax credit and providing a government buy-down of mortgage interest rates for home purchasers," said NAHB's new chief economist David Crowe. "Both policies were successfully combined in the "70s to stimulate home buyer demand, and could get housing and the national economy moving again."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest government data, issued about three weeks ago, showed new-home sales made a surprising 2.7% jump last month to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 464,000 in September. Still, year-over-year, new-home sales were 33.1% lower than the level in September 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling prices are hurting sales -- would-be buyers are hoping for a better deal and not signing off on property so fast. A high inventory of unsold homes is depressing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAHB's overall housing market index for November was based on a survey of 422 home builders, who answer questions about sales prospects now and in the near term. When the Housing Market Index exceeds 50, it means the number of builders who see "good" sales outnumber the number who see "poor" sales. The numbers used in compiling the index are adjusted for seasonal variations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Prices Tumbled in 3rd Quarter, Realtors Say</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among 152 metropolitan areas included in the National Association of Realtors' survey, 120 posted declines in median home sales prices compared with a year ago. Nationally, sales fell by almost 8% in the third quarter compared with the same period a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of foreclosures and other distressed properties made up around 40% of transactions in the quarter, bringing down the median price by 9% from a year ago to $200,500. Sales fell in all but four states in the Realtors' group's report. The exceptions were Nevada, California, Arizona and Virginia, where buyers have been able to snap up foreclosed homes at a bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A very large proportion of distressed home sales are taking place at discounted prices compared to more normal conditions a year ago," Charles McMillan, the Realtors group's president, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's especially true in places like Sacramento and Riverside, Calif., where prices were down 37% and 39%, respectively, from last year. The two California cities had the largest annual price declines in the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A nasty brew of strict lending standards, falling home values and a tough economy is filtering through the housing market. By the end of the year, foreclosure listing service RealtyTrac Inc. expects more than a million bank-owned properties to have piled up on the market, representing around a third of all properties for sale in the U.S.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After hammering giant public real-estate companies, pain in the commercial-property market is now hitting some small, private investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DBSI Inc., a privately held real-estate firm that catered to mom-and-pop investors, filed for bankruptcy protection last week, tossing into turmoil at least 8,500 investors and nearly 240 commercial properties valued at $2.4 billion in over 30 states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A DBSI attorney, Stephen Burr, says, "the bankruptcy filing was necessary to create an orderly process for the maximum return for all DBSI's creditors including its investors." Mr. Burr declined to comment further and company officials couldn't be reached.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The collapse is the latest example of how commercial real estate is entering its worst period since the early 1990s. While public companies like mall operator <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties Inc</span>. and warehouse owner <span class="companylink">ProLogis</span> have seen their stocks drop on credit worries and falling rents, privately held DBSI's downfall shows the problems that can face the many small real-estate owners who fly below the radar of public markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Whatever a depression is, in the real-estate industry, we are in one," says Richard Lipton, a partner at law firm Baker &amp;McKenzie LLP who specializes in real-estate investments similar to the ones used by DBSI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DBSI, based in Boise, Idaho, and founded in 1980, was a leader in so-called tenant-in-common, or TIC, real-estate transactions. The appeal of TICs is delaying payment of taxes. When landlords sell properties for a profit, they normally have to pay capital-gains taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Internal Revenue Service, however, allows owners to delay paying these taxes if the proceeds are invested in another property within 180 days. In a TIC, an individual buys a slice of a property along with other investors, while a sponsor, such as DBSI, manages the transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private real-estate investments, including TICs, partnerships and other property vehicles, are among the most popular forms of investment after stocks. Private investors control roughly 36% of the $4.7 trillion commercial real-estate market, including $3.4 trillion of debt, according to Raymond Torto, chief economist at <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, a brokerage and research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many years, investors had to put proceeds from an old property into a new, wholly owned property, to benefit from the special tax treatment. But a 2002 IRS ruling made it easy for landlords to instead invest in a TIC, an arrangement where a number of owners have fractional shares in a property, such as a strip mall or office building. TICs exploded in popularity after the rule change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, the most recent figures, 293,676 individuals took part in so-called 1031 exchanges, referring to the section of the federal tax code that TICs use to defer capital-gains taxes, according to Internal Revenue Service figures. TIC investments are down substantially in 2008, as financing markets have dried up and some investors elected to pay capital-gains taxes in advance of a possible capital-gains tax increase under a Democratic administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fueled by cheap lending and the commercial real-estate frenzy that followed, new TIC equity investments grew to $3.7 billion a year in 2006 from less than $356 million a year in 2002, according to Omni Real Estate Services, a Salt Lake City TIC brokerage and research firm. That equity bought $8 billion worth of property in 2006, using debt that was often sold on Wall Street as commercial mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DBSI which operated under names such as Spectrus Real Estate and For 1031 LLC, stood out from other TIC sponsors by guaranteeing returns that investors would receive from properties -- 6.5% and growing over time to 12% annually -- whether or not the property performed well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, the return on a TIC investment varies according to the performance of the individual property. Under the DBSI arrangement, if one property wasn't performing well, DBSI could use profits from another to make up the difference. It also could use the fees and markups it made arranging new TIC deals to feed the older ones. But when the market seized, there wasn't enough cash to meet its obligations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors were attracted to the guarantee. "It's like buying a bond. You trust the people you buy it from," says Betz Frederick, who along with her husband Harold made three TIC investments in 2007 through DBSI, including two on office buildings in Omaha, Neb. The Tempe, Ariz., couple, both mathematics professors who hold Ph.D.s, were attracted by DBSI's long history, and that the couple wouldn't have to care for the properties like their previous real-estate investments. "DBSI had been around for 29 years," Ms. Frederick says. "We were tired of doing toilets and trash."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company stopped making monthly distributions in October, sending its far-flung TIC investors panicking. "It really is devastating for a lot of us that trusted them," says Ruth Cook, a 72-year-old widow from College Park, Md. She relied on a $440,000 DBSI investment to generate $2,000 a month, or about half her living expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't clear yet how much money people will lose through DBSI, according to DBSI bankruptcy filings and people familiar with the matter. Some will be forced to inject more capital or lose their properties to foreclosure. Other investors could emerge relatively unscathed if their underlying properties are performing well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before anything can be settled, DBSI's investors are left to deal with one of the hairiest legal unravelings in real-estate history. "This will be an order of magnitude that has not been seen in terms of the complexity," says Bradley Williams of Best &amp;Flanagan LLP, a Minneapolis law firm that represents a lender who holds mortgages on some DBSI managed properties. Each TIC investment, which owns a single building, contains as many as 35 investors who must make all major decisions unanimously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previously, a modest-size regional property player, DBSI jumped on the TIC bandwagon after the IRS ruling. DBSI collected more than $1 billion in investor equity through TIC offerings, amassing a sizable portfolio of office buildings, strip malls, medical buildings and apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DBSI also had investments in raw land and development projects and raised $275 million from thousands of small investors through private bond placements. It owns several small technology companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DBSI's chief executive, Douglas Swenson, blamed the company's downfall on the "unprecedented events" in the real-estate and financial markets, and rising operating costs and weakness in leasing, according to its bankruptcy filing in Delaware federal bankruptcy court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some critics say DBSI's business model was broken from the start. "The way their real-estate TIC offerings were made...was unsustainable," says Paul Mangiantini, a Boise attorney who has sued DBSI in Idaho State Court on behalf of several investors. His suit alleges, among other things, that DBSI collapsed when real-estate markets prevented the company from sourcing new deals to feed what it owed on the old ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wayne Duling, an Agoura Hills, Calif., resident who invested in two DBSI properties, regrets the whole episode. "I would have rather just paid the taxes, had the money safely in the bank," he says. "Everybody will tell you that."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Devastating brush fires blazed through three counties in the Los Angeles area for a second day on Saturday, as strong winds and high temperatures strained the resources of firefighters and destroyed hundreds of homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winds died down slightly Saturday night, allowing firefighters to gain a little bit of control over some of the blazes, but winds and high temperatures were expected to continue Sunday, which could spread the blazes further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one point Saturday, firefighters employed a DC-10 to drop a load of retardant on a blaze raging in southeast of Los Angeles Saturday afternoon, but strong winds pushed the fire westward, where it consumed more homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fire, which began in the area around Corona, in Riverside County and had consumed almost 6,000 acres, was one of several that firefighters were battling in Southern California Saturday. The outbreak of multiple blazes forced firefighters to spread their resources out around the region. The hot temperatures and dry winds, sometimes above 75 miles per hour, blew embers in different directions, frustrating firefighters' efforts to hold the line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flames also knocked out power in some areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 650 homes – including mobile homes -- had already been destroyed by Saturday, and damage was expected to worsen, as several of the fires were still not contained and were moving through densely populated areas. Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said the fires had destroyed more homes than any in the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 22,000 people had been evacuated. Evacuation centers were being set up around the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fire in Sylmar, on the edge of the Angeles National Forest, ripped through communities, destroying more than 160 homes as well as 500 mobile homes. One mobile-home park was said to be completely devastated. Homes were continuing to catch fire in Yorba Linda and Corona. In Anaheim Hills, a 250-unit apartment complex was fully engulfed in flames. There were no deaths reported; however, police and firefighters planned to conduct searches in some of the areas that were hit to look for victims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Police said that five people had been arrested on suspicion of looting in some the areas that had been evacuated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles. Smoke from the fires reduced air quality in certain areas to dangerous levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fires Saturday followed a devastating blaze which ripped through the community of Montecito, a wealthy enclave of about 10,000 residents not far from Santa Barbara, destroying 111 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That fire caused extensive property damage among area's large, estate-style properties. Homeowners include Oprah Winfrey, actor Rob Lowe and a host of top executives and entrepreneurs. The blaze broke out Thursday evening near Westmont College, a private Christian school, and soon overwhelmed dozens of nearby homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blaze spread to about four square miles and did most of its damage overnight. Calmer winds early Friday assisted firefighter efforts, but officials have not said when the fire would be contained. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency, and by mid-morning Friday, more than 500 firefighters from departments around the state were helping. The cause of the fire is not yet known. Only a few minor injuries were reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin O'Connor, co-founder of Internet advertisement-technology company DoubleClick, owns an estate across the road from a former private tea garden where officials say the fire started. He said his wife arrived home Thursday evening with one of their three children and saw the flames. Mr. O'Connor was traveling. "I woke up this morning and thought our place was gone," he said Friday. "Surprisingly, it wasn't." The family worried, however, that their home could still be at risk on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Connor's estate, which was built in 1918, features a renovated 13,000-square-foot Italian-inspired mansion on more than six hillside acres. It is listed for sale for $35 million, though after the fire, he says, "I doubt if it will be on the market anymore."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property losses from the fire are likely to be high. Montecito lies along the so-called Gold Coast of California, one of the most expensive real-estate markets in the country. The median price of homes sold in the area in September was $935,000, compared with a statewide level of $316,480, according to the California Association of Realtors. Although the median home price has fallen some 40% in the past year in that part of Santa Barbara County, Montecito still boasts a relatively strong market for multimillion-dollar homes, real-estate brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to historic estates, the area's neighborhoods have smaller homes, where even the lots are worth more than $1 million, said Randy Solakian, who markets estates and ranches for Coldwell Banker Previews International. He was among 9,000 evacuees, including 4,500 ordered to leave their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even several smaller homes in the fire area are worth at least $3 million, according to Suzanne Perkins, a prominent agent with <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>. "We kind of dug our own grave by not allowing controlled burns," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 27 homes with listing prices of more than $10 million are on the market. Steve Deutsch, vice president of First Choice Private Mortgage Bank, said he closed two mortgages on homes worth $10 million in the past month. One home was in the fire area, he said, but he didn't know whether it burned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Montecito has been a resort destination and refuge for the wealthy for more than a century. East Coast industrialists bought land and built large estates. Later, Hollywood stars and moguls gravitated to the community, known for a landscape that is uncommonly lush for Southern California. Eucalyptus and palm trees shade winding canyon roads. Stone walls and hedges shield vast residential estates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those same attractions can put homeowners at risk. The Montecito Fire Protection District, which provides full-time protection services to the area from two fire stations, says on its Web site that the last major fire was in 1990. Three previous fires since 1964 have also passed through the community, destroying houses and taking lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like most communities built within California's so-called urban-wildland interface, the local fire department requires homeowners to clear the brush surrounding their homes. Montecito's homes are lush with foliage and old trees, including highly flammable eucalyptus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The local fire agency plainly warns its citizens: "Wildland fires have always been a part of Montecito's natural environment. Areas of Montecito will burn again. This is not maybe. This is a given."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim Buckley, editor and associate publisher of the Montecito Journal, a local publication, said the mountains above Montecito haven't burned in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, even the people who make a living off the area's real-estate wonders are on the run. Local agent Dan Encell says he was dining with his family last night in Santa Barbara when he learned they would need to evacuate their 4,500 square-foot house. "We took pictures and jewelry and that was it," he said by cellphone. He spoke while en route to another property he owned, a vineyard in nearby Paso Robles, Calif.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ask the average investor, and he or she would say <span class="companylink">Boeing Co</span>. is a terrific company, lauded by analysts, for years a strong investment as defense and aerospace spending boomed and the stock soared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of 23 Wall Street analysts covering the company, 13 hold "buy" ratings, and just two sells. Short interest is a paltry 1.7% of the company's float.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Devoted followers of this industrial bellwether have watched it confront multiple delays of its next-generation Dreamliner 787 jet and as of Friday, delays of new 747 planes. They've watched it contend with a machinists strike that hamstrung production, and faithfully observed a 56% decline in the shares since its 52-week high of $94.60 a share, on Nov. 30, 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Boeing</span>'s forward price-to-earnings ratio slipped to 6.58 Friday, its lowest in years. The company still has a strong backlog of aircraft orders to work through, even with the delays in the 747 planes and its never-ending issues with the Dreamliner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you're a short-term player that doesn't matter, but for a long-term investor that's pretty relevant information," says Bernie McGinn of McGinn Investment Management, who owns shares of <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>. "It's been hit for a 60-some-odd percent loss, and that doesn't make sense."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts, however, are wary. <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> analysts noted in commentary Friday that the valuation is becoming more attractive, but the "negative news flow" is likely to continue through 2009 as it deals with disruptions in the supply line once the backlog is exhausted and before the first group of new 747s is delivered in late 2010. Oppenheimer &amp;Co. analysts say the stock, while cheap, "could stay cheap."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This isn't to say <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> is losing admirers. But they may choose to admire from afar for a bit longer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zombie Mansions:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes Won't Sell</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new index that tracks sales of luxury homes shows that more mansions are languishing on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Luxury Home Marketing's newly launched Luxury Housing Report, a kind of Case-Schiller index for rich zip codes, shows that homes at the top of the housing market have been sitting for sale for an average of 145 days. That is up from about 130 in September and from about 110 from May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is that prices have been fairly stable at the top. The median price for homes in the index is hovering at $1.154 million, or $336 a square foot, which is about even with the Sept. 1 numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bad news is that more big homes are sitting around unsold, turning America's shoreline drives and gated golf estates into zombie communities. The total inventory of homes in the selected zip codes total 39,175. Only 2,202 homes in the zip codes were sold in the week ended Nov. 2. Fully 43% had recent price decreases.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A wind-whipped brush fire in the coastal hills near Santa Barbara, Calif., ripped through one of the most expensive residential areas in the U.S., destroying more than 100 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fire was centered in the hills near Montecito, a wealthy enclave of about 10,000 residents in a Mediterranean-like setting, where large, estate-style properties are common, and homeowners include Oprah Winfrey, actor Rob Lowe and a host of top executives and entrepreneurs.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York's Harlem neighborhood, a largely intact Romanesque Revival house built by circus co-founder James Bailey is on the market for the first time since 1951, with an asking price of $10 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On St. Nicholas Place and 150th Street, at the northern end of Manhattan, the freestanding stone house (above) measures 12,000 square feet on a 62.5-by-100-foot lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bailey, who was the business-minded half of Barnum &amp;Bailey Circus, built the house in 1888, a few years after combining operations with P.T. Barnum's "Greatest Show on Earth." A cousin of Louis Comfort Tiffany designed the home's numerous stained-glass windows, most of which remain intact. The home's interior is paneled in hand-carved wood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marguerite Blake, now 87 years old, and her late husband, Warren, a New York police detective, bought the house in 1951. Ms. Blake, a former funeral-home director, and a niece live in the house, which needs renovations. Real-estate agent Lana Turner, of Denise Shaw &amp;Associates, has the listing.</p>

The <span class="companylink">Paulson &amp;Co</span>. founder just cut the three-acre property's price by another $3 million, down to $13.9 million from $19.5 million when he first listed it in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paulson traded up in January, paying $41.3 million for one of the most expensive listings in the chic Hamptons: a 10.4-acre Southampton estate known as Old Trees with a 15,000-square-foot restored shingle-style mansion, two guest houses, a pool, staff quarters and extensive frontage on Lake Agawam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, Mr. Paulson paid $12.75 million for the 6,800-square-foot "cottage" now for sale. It has seven bedrooms and an enclosed pool, unusual for the Hamptons. Michael Shaheen, of Prudential Douglas Elliman, and Harald Grant, of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, have the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, Mr. Paulson testified on Capitol Hill at a closely watched hearing on whether hedge funds require more regulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barrymore's Old L.A. House</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Angeles, a house that was once owned by actor John Barrymore is for sale, with an asking price of $6.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barrymore, the star of such films as "Grand Hotel," and his wife, silent-film actress Dolores Costello, bought the house in 1938, but they divorced and Mr. Barrymore never moved in. They're the grandparents of actress Drew Barrymore. Mr. Barrymore died in 1942 at age 60, Ms. Costello in 1979 at age 75.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Hancock Park, the 6,300-square-foot house on 0.6 acre was built in 1918. Subsequent owners have included opera baritone Lawrence Tibbett. The current owner, a banker, paid $5 million for the house in 2005 and did extensive restorations. Rick Cunningham of <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> and Diana Knox and Betsy Malloy, of Coldwell Banker, have the listing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(See Correction &amp;Amplification below [CX] .)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate development and the credit markets are nearly frozen, but developer Ben Carter seems undaunted as he moves forward with plans to bring his hometown Atlanta its own version of New York's Madison Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carter's $1.5 billion project, The Streets of Buckhead, aims to be the Southeast's most luxurious shopping, dining and living destination, spanning seven city blocks and eight acres in one of Atlanta's wealthiest neighborhoods. It will also be located near two of <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group</span>'s most successful upscale malls: Phipps Plaza and Lenox Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think a lot of people understand what I'm doing because it's very rare a luxury street project gets created from scratch," Mr. Carter said. "We're making a new kind of experience."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carter remains confident and said the economic downturn could actually benefit his project's first phase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've heard the economy should start to recover next year," Mr. Carter said. "We open in late 2009 or maybe early 2010. Our timing ought to be pretty good to capture the pent-up demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With about 50% of the project's first phase leased, Carter's tenant list already boasts market exclusives such as French jeweler <span class="companylink">Van Cleef &amp;Arpels</span> and <span class="companylink">Brunello Cucinelli</span>, an Italian luxury cashmere company. He even stole Hermes SA from Simon, leasing the French luxury goods maker its first Atlanta flagship stand-alone location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while Mr. Carter's development seems to be off to a good start, some observers say it could be in for a bumpy ride. That's because, as the global credit crisis continues to unfold, he faces a tough real-estate financing market, as well as a consumer environment where even the wealthiest are scaling back purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The credit crunch has dealt real-estate developers around the country a potent blow, causing them to delay, scale back or even cancel some projects. CBRE/Torto Wheaton Research, a Boston-based real estate research firm, estimated that developers delivered 6.3 million square feet of retail real estate space during the third quarter -- or about three-quarters of the 8.5 million square feet originally planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Green Street Advisors, another research company, has said at least 13 strip shopping centers under development by public companies have been canceled this year, and the seven public shopping-center developers it monitors have delayed 90 others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financing "is a problem for virtually all real estate property types in this environment, but particularly in retail, as companies cut back on store locations and consumers spend less," said Jim Sullivan, a Green Street analyst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Deals that were committed are now becoming uncommitted," said Stuart Eisenberg, a partner and managing director in the real-estate group at consultant BDO Seidman, referring to Cedar Shopping Centers' recent decision to drop its joint venture with Nova Scotia development company <span class="companylink">Homburg Invest Inc</span>..</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bullish On Buckhead</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the Streets of Buckhead, Mr. Carter says that his financing remains intact. Funding comes from a combination of his own money, funds from a few other wealthy Atlanta families and equity financing from CB Richard Ellis Investors' Strategic Partners Fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest plan has the approximately $800 million first phase set to debut next fall or, at the latest, early 2010. It will include about 375,000 square feet of retail and restaurants, as well as 356 residential units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second phase, which should debut in 2011, will include another 125,000 square feet of retail and restaurants, a boutique hotel with 250 rooms and an additional 350 apartment rental residences, Mr. Carter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, the development will have about 80 retailers and 14 restaurants for both phases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because it will refine a stretch of bars, the project has received plenty of kudos from local politicians and community boards. But that isn't enough to insulate it from the slumping economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carter initially thought his project might support as many as four hotels, but with hotel financing scarce in the current environment, he pulled back his plans. Now, a hotel has been delayed until the second round "once the economy gets better," he said, adding that he is negotiating a letter of intent with a major hotel company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also canceled plans for the Esplanade, a top-tier office building originally set to be done in 2010, because of Buckhead's oversupply of similar construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four office buildings with a combined 2 million square feet are set to hit the market in 2009 and the beginning of 2010, according to <span class="companylink">CoStar Group Inc</span>., a commercial real estate information provider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another problem: As of the third quarter, the vacancy rate of top-tier office buildings in Buckhead was 17.2%, giving tenants the upper hand in lease negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Carter would be better served to wait until the middle to end of next year to figure out whether or not he should decide to move forward" with the office space, said Hansell Roddenbery, associate director of real estate advisory firm CresaPartners in Atlanta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carter is also constructing Streets of Buckhead during a sharp downturn in consumer spending, when even the wealthiest have been scaling back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a year-to-date basis, Unity Marketing found in October that very affluent consumers, with incomes of $250,000 and above, have trimmed their luxury spending by nearly 20%, while consumers with incomes from $100,000 to $249,000 have pulled back their spending 10%. The survey also found that more than half the 1,161 consumers surveyed planned to cut back their luxury spending in the next 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Streets of Buckhead will be located in an area of Atlanta known for its high-end shopping. The neighborhood is ranked the ninth wealthiest in the country with 63,525 high net-worth individuals making $1 million or more, according to a study by market-research firm Claritas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta falls in the top 10 of all American cities of total retail sales, and the Buckhead area alone rakes in more than $1 billion in shopping revenue, according to the Buckhead Business Association.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Where the 'Denominator Effect' Lurks; Institutional Investors, Hit by Stock Losses, May Need to Cut Property Bets</span>
</div><div class="author">By Anton Troianovski </div><div>872 words</div><div>12 November 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; C12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "denominator effect" looms as the next force that could pressure the slumping real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling stock prices are leaving institutional investors overexposed to real estate, which could trigger further declines in property values as some of the market's most-active players move to the sidelines to recalibrate their portfolios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big pension funds, college endowments and insurance companies typically allocate most of their investment dollars to stocks and bonds and sometimes a smaller amount -- about 6% to 10% for pension funds and as much as 30% for other institutions -- to real estate. In the past decade, as real-estate values rose rapidly, many institutional investors expanded their real-estate holdings and in many cases became fully invested in the sector or close to it, bumping up against their preferred allocations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that stock values are beaten down, and because real estate is typically appraised only once a year and not daily like stocks, the relative size of the real-estate portfolio has grown and in many cases is now higher than the funds' guidelines. This is known as the denominator effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Total Pie Shrinking'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate demand "has been destroyed effectively by the unintended consequence of the total pie shrinking," said Stephen B. Hansen, a managing director at ING Clarion Partners LLC in New York. ING Clarion is an arm of ING Real Estate, which manages some $180 billion in assets for large institutions and other investors. "Certainly these institutions are less prone to making new real-estate investments today than anytime in the past seven or eight years," Mr. Hansen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last December, a swath of pension funds surveyed by Institutional Real Estate Inc. held a total of $331.5 billion, or 8.5% of their portfolios, in real estate. In sum, these funds were below an average target allocation of 9.6% in real estate by a total of $42.9 billion. Last month, these same funds still held about $321.6 billion in real estate. But because of the declining stock market, they held $42.2 billion of property beyond their target, with an average of 11.1% of their portfolios in real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consequences of the denominator effect will take months, if not years, to play out. Funds are loath to try to sell their privately held real-estate holdings in the current market, in which transactions have reached a virtual standstill because of the lack of debt financing. They also are wary of not meeting capital calls from investment funds to which they already are committed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Pullback?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Institutional investors concerned about their real-estate allocation may respond to the denominator effect by pulling back on future investment -- setting the stage for a further decline in demand for commercial real estate next year, and adding to the downward price pressure in an already embattled market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We'll continue to fulfill the commitments we've made as they're called," said Jeffrey W. States, chief investment officer of the Sacramento County Employees' Retirement System, with $5.7 billion in assets in June. "But I think the denominator effect does have the impact of slowing any additional activity we do until we start to see the asset values move back."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The San Francisco Employees' Retirement System, which had $18.8 billion in assets as of January 2008, is taking a similar approach. "If the denominator doesn't come back into sync, then our new investments would be curtailed," said Richard Peterson, a trustee of the pension fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Immediate Impact?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the public market, the consequence of institutional investors seeking to reduce their real-estate exposure already may be having an impact. The shares of publicly traded equity real-estate investment trusts -- which pool money to make property investments and return most of their profits to investors -- have plunged 28% during the past month, while the broader stock market has stayed about flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some industry leaders say the outsize decline in REITs stems in part from institutions trying to unload some of their real-estate holdings. REIT stocks are "easier to sell than selling an asset or selling fund positions," said Michael D. Fascitelli, president of Vornado Realty Trust Inc., a commercial-property REIT with $21 billion in assets. "That's why our stock is off a lot more." Vornado shares have lost 20% of their value during the past month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Bad News</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As institutions cast a wary eye to their real-estate exposure as their overall portfolio shrinks, an outflow of capital may spell more bad news for a commercial real-estate market already being hit by a frozen credit market and sagging demand for retail and office space. Pension funds provided $157.1 billion of the $1.16 trillion of equity real-estate capital available in 2008, according to the non-profit Urban Land Institute and <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some are redeeming, some are not putting any more money in," Charles Leitner, the global head of <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank Group</span>'s RREEF Alternative Investments, said of institutional investors. "There's no new capital coming in."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- Jeremy Burnett thought the five units in the building he spent more than a year renovating would sell quickly. But after 50 days on the market, the five units haven't received a serious offer. Now he has slashed prices more than 10% -- from $799,000 to $699,000 in the case of the most expensive unit -- and is offering a free Toyota Prius to the first buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burnett isn't a victim of the housing downturn. The San Francisco real-estate market has held up over the past year: On average, single-family homes and condos in the city sold at a higher price and at a higher rate in September 2008 than a year earlier, although prices are down slightly from August, according to brokerage SFResidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers are bypassing Mr. Burnett's building mainly due to its tenant-in-common, or TIC, structure. Most TIC arrangements involve commercial real estate, where a group of investors each buy a fractional share of an investment property, like a shopping mall or office building, and share rental income and profits on any future sale. In the past year, many commercial TICs have suffered as rental income has declined in a slowing economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problems facing residential TICs, which are found mainly in San Francisco, are different and reflect tighter mortgage underwriting standards. Banks across the country have pulled back from all types of mortgage lending, but especially for nontraditional types of mortgages. As a result, borrowing costs for TICs have shot up, causing home buyers to avoid the structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sterling Bank &amp;Trust FSB recently raised its rate for TIC loans to 7.75% -- a loan for a similarly priced condo would require only 6% to 6.25% interest -- and now requires a down payment of at least 20% of the purchase price. Other banks are now requiring 30% down. In the past, lenders required buyers to put 10% down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until 2005, purchasing a TIC required all of the buyers to attain a single mortgage, which they all shared. That meant that if one tenant defaulted, the others were on the hook. But several banks have since started offering so-called fractional mortgages, separate loans that make buyers responsible only for the unit they inhabit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks, mortgage brokers, and real-estate agents say there has never been a foreclosure on a fractional TIC loan; some say there has never been a late payment. Still, there is no secondary market for these loans because of their short history and nontraditional structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential TIC loans "are definitely more risky," says Richard Yurich, a loan officer at Sterling Bank. "Once we make the loan it's ours; nobody wants to buy them." His bank raised rates and requires more money down to protect itself from a bad investment, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is another catch: There are no fixed-rate loans for TICs, meaning that buyers are forced to accept new terms after three to five years. This wasn't a holdup when property values were increasing and mortgage rates were trending down, says Glenn Rodriguez, a mortgage broker. "That's where we've lost a lot of the buyers over the last couple of months," he says. "People are worried."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential TICs emerged in San Francisco more than a decade ago as a way for developers to bypass rent-control laws that make it all but impossible to convert properties in the city into condominiums. In a TIC, the parties buy partial ownership of a two- to 12-unit building; it's similar to the stock cooperatives found in New York and other cities but without the legal status and protection that comes with that structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, TICs made up just 7% of San Francisco properties sold, down from 15% a year earlier. Their average price also has declined to $573,429 now from $659,945 a year ago, according to SFResidence. That's by far the worst percentage decline for any category of residential real estate in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denise Persson, a 35-year-old technology marketer who recently moved to San Francisco from Washington, is looking to buy a home, but quickly ruled out TICs. "You're at greater risk from the financial situation" in a TIC, she says. "We wanted to have more control." She and her husband have limited their search to single-family homes and condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The units that Mr. Burnett is trying to sell have views of downtown and the San Francisco Bay. They have locally made windows and cabinets; each unit comes with a parking space. That isn't enough to lure buyers, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mr. Burnett is offering to personally lend buyers money for down payments. But he can't offer the one thing that would help the most. "If I offered someone a fixed-rate loan I'd have these things sold by now," he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes listed for sale in many metropolitan areas declined again last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes available for sale in 29 major metropolitan areas in October was down 1.6% from a month earlier, according to figures compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a real-estate brokerage firm based in Emeryville, Calif. The ZipRealty data cover all single-family homes, condominiums and town houses listed on local multiple-listing services in metro areas where the firm operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though inventories of listed homes have been falling, they remain unusually large. Meanwhile, some real-estate agents say sales, after improving in recent months, stalled in late September and October as falling stock prices and worries about the economy rattled potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a national basis, home inventories typically rise modestly in October from September. Over the past 25 years, the average increase in October has been 1.1%, according to Zelman &amp;Associates, a research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, about 4.3 million previously occupied homes were listed for sale at the end of September, according to the National Association of Realtors. At the current sales rate, that is enough homes to last about 10 months, the trade group says. The housing market is considered roughly in balance between supply and demand when the inventory is around six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The October inventory in 29 metro areas was down about 9.3% from a year earlier, ZipRealty said. Foreclosed homes are a big part of the current supply, however, and they aren't always sold through multiple-listing services. That makes the exact inventory situation uncertain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ZipRealty data don't cover New York City. Miller Samuel Inc., an appraisal firm based there, says there were 7,444 cooperative apartments and condominiums on the market in Manhattan at the end of October, up 6.3% from September and 37% from October 2007.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For anyone wanting to take advantage of today's buyer's market, distressed properties offer the best chance to make a killing. But you need good credit or ready access to cash, and a taste for the hunt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As I've mentioned in previous columns [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121501183835523159.html], searching for a foreclosure can be maddeningly frustrating. Newspaper notices of foreclosure sales are disorganized; foreclosure-listing Web sites charge hefty monthly fees; lenders post only minimal information on the properties they've taken back. And many real estate agents have little experience with these sorts of transactions, and don't want to be bothered with them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means foreclosure buyers must be willing to do more sleuthing on their own to find the best deals. Here are some tips to get started:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Focus on one neighborhood: Although distressed properties are found everywhere these days, not every one is a good deal, especially if the seller bought at the top of the market or if the entire neighborhood is undergoing a decline. It's best to concentrate on places where there are relatively few distressed properties and good job growth. These areas will revive quickly once housing returns to normal. Once you've targeted and studied property values in a particular neighborhood, drive around and look for properties that aren't as well-kept as the ones around it -- then start ringing doorbells. You may be able to buy directly from an owner who's in financial trouble even before the loan defaults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research the property: Although major real-estate Web sites and portals for both agent-listed and for-sale-by-owner properties list foreclosures these days, most provide minimal information and refer you to a subscription-based foreclosure listing site. Some lenders also list the properties they've taken back, though information on these properties is also sparse. (Here's a good link to these lender sites [http://www.realestate-invest.com/REOwebsites.htm])</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once you've targeted a property, check out the local assessor's office: Web sites for these offices often list the owner of the property, tax information, assessed value, square footage and aerial pictures. Most importantly, they reveal what the seller paid for the home, which could be more or less than the property is worth now. The best deals generally come from sellers who have owned their homes for a long time and have built up some equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Learn what the seller wants: Knowing what motivates the seller gets you the best deal. If monthly carrying costs are high, you'll score if you can settle quickly. Or if a lender is trying to minimize losses on a foreclosed property which no longer is worth the unpaid loan amount, you might be able to negotiate a very good deal on financing by agreeing to pay a close-to-market price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Find an experienced broker: While it makes sense to gather as much information yourself as you can, and to deal directly with sellers whenever you can, some lenders refuse to deal directly with buyers. If that's the case with the property you've targeted, find an agent with ample recent experience with distressed and foreclosed properties. Ask the agent to explain the details of the deals: How much was offered compared to the asking price, how long it took for the seller or lender to accept the offer, and any concessions the agent was able to negotiate. Pay attention not just to the answers, but to the emotions the agent expresses. Foreclosure deals are often complex and time-consuming; you don't want an agent who lacks diplomacy, patience and perseverance.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actor Kelsey Grammer is trying to sell two Los Angeles houses he bought last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 53-year-old Mr. Grammer, who also owns a house in nearby Malibu and starred in "Cheers" and "Frasier," is asking $4.35 million for his estate in the Bel-Air neighborhood. He bought the 7,600-square-foot house, which was built in 1999, for $4.05 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property is a relatively flat 1.5-acre lot that has views of Los Angeles and a long private driveway that many celebrities favor. A buyer would likely renovate or tear down the house, says listing agent Mauricio Umansky, of Hilton &amp;Hyland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second house Mr. Grammer is selling is an English Normandy-style house in Holmby Hills on less than an acre with seven bedrooms, nine bathrooms and a gym. He listed it this summer for $19.9 million but recently lowered the asking price to $18.9 million. (Mr. Umansky also has that listing.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Fox chose not to renew Mr. Grammer's sitcom "Back to You" after its first season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NYC Developer Faces Suit Over Fifth Avenue Penthouse</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A penthouse buyer at The Grand Madison, a Fifth Avenue development in Manhattan, is suing El-Ad Properties for $6.4 million claiming fraud and breach of contract. It's the third complaint filed against the developer regarding sales of apartments built on the roofs of existing buildings; the other two suits involve the company's work on the iconic Plaza Hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June 2006, Hiralion Real Estate Inc. -- a Panama-based corporation created to purchase the unit -- agreed to pay $6.85 million for the 12th- and 13th-floor penthouse, and made a $1.24 million downpayment, according to the complaint. The unit's upper floor was supposed to have a "breathtaking [Madison Square] Park view," but was, in fact, "an entombed outdoor space with buttresses" with a wall blocking the view, the complaint states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lawsuit filed last Friday in New York state Supreme Court by law firm Shiboleth LLP names El-Ad as well as a real-estate marketing firm and a law firm. El-Ad, which bought the Madison Square building at 225 Fifth Ave. in 2004, called the suit "baseless" and the buyer's obligations to honor the purchase contract "rock solid."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flush with a $100 million-plus divorce settlement from golfer Greg Norman, Laura Andrassy is buying an estate in New York's Hamptons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Andrassy is in contract to pay $7.55 million for a 0.92-acre property on Southhampton's leafy Wyandanch Lane, near the ocean, and plans to tear down the nearly 3,500-square-foot house, people familiar with the situation say. The property, with a pool, was listed a month ago for $8.75 million with Tim Davis, of <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>. She's upgrading from a Southampton house that she bought last year and that's farther from the water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Norman, a native Australian, spent many months in the 1980s and 1990s as the world's No. 1-ranked pro golfer. The Normans waged a bitter public divorce battle that ended this year when Ms. Andrassy won $103 million in assets, court records show. This past June, Mr. Norman married former tennis star Chris Evert.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Honolulu</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here two weeks ago to visit his then-ailing grandmother, Barack Obama slipped out the back of her Beretania Street apartment building for a stroll in his old neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turning east on Young Street, its sidewalk frequently interrupted by patches of well-worn grass, he passed the auto-parts store that in his youth housed the Cinerama theater, known in 1977 as the only movie house in the city playing "Star Wars." He passed behind the small strip mall housing the same Baskin-Robbins ice cream shop that employed him in high school. And as reporters followed, he strolled by the old "Cactus house," so-named in the 1970s, neighbors say, because a resident at the time named Pedro grew dozens of different kind of cacti, some as fat as a basketball.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to his autobiography, President-elect Obama left Indonesia in 1971 when he was 10 years old and returned to Hawaii to live with his grandparents. He would live with them for most of his high school years and spent much of that time here, in a five-block radius surrounding his grandparents' building. Dubbed "lower Makiki" by real estate agents, this aging, middle-class neighborhood is one of the many forgotten areas of Honolulu, a patchwork where glitzy high-rises can sit alongside ethnic grocers, discount stores and karaoke bars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while the golden strands of Waikiki two miles to the southeast and the exclusive suburbs further on have been heavily glossed by wealthy second-home buyers, lower Makiki is mostly the same as it was when "Barry" was here, shooting hoops and gobbling up plate lunches, a local medley of meat, sticky rice and often a "salad" made mostly from mayonnaise and macaroni.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as it was in the 1970s, this neighborhood is still a dense urban mix of fading plantation-style cottages, low-rise rental apartments and flower and noodle shops. Stray kittens lounge lazily in the shade of a little clapboard cottage with a gravel-strewn yard pocked with weeds and candy wrappers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scrawny red ti-leaf plants, believed to bring good luck, peek out of patchy lawns. Lanais jutting from low-rise concrete apartment buildings are piled with junk: bicycles, surfboards and laundry lines heavy with wet clothes. An updated two-bedroom, two-bath apartment in The Banyan Tree Plaza apartments diagonally across the street from the apartment Mr. Obama grew up in recently sold for $490,000 -- cheap by Hawaii's nosebleed standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was surprised when they said he lived right here. This is not a fancy neighborhood," says Ernie Akizuki, an 80-year-old who lives in a 1927 cottage he bought 50 years ago for $10,000. Mr. Akizuki's two-bedroom house is typical for the area: squeezed onto a 1,700-square-foot lot crowded with mango, tangerine and plumeria trees. "Those days a penny was one penny. You see one on the ground and you pick it up, can buy one stick candy. A penny now is dirty, you no like touch."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many of his affluent classmates at the elite Punahou School would have been driven to its grassy campus from wealthy suburbs like Tantalus or Kahala, most days Mr. Obama walked to class five blocks away. He'd pass the hospital where he was born and cross over a six-lane highway packed with commuters from the wealthier areas headed for jobs downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a high school student and basketball player, Mr. Obama would walk to Punahou on weekends to play pickup games with fellow team members and other locals on school courts, says Dean Ando, a classmate and basketball teammate who now lives in Tacoma, Wash. "We used to play basketball in [rubber] slippahs," Mr. Ando boasts, using the local lingo for flip-flops. "I remember we would have brand new slippahs and we'd ruin 'em."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Obama wasn't walking, Mr. Ando says he used Honolulu's bus system, which is simply named "TheBus." Mr. Ando recalls getting lost with the future president on their way to a record store -- even though "Barry" considered himself "TheBus expert." When Mr. Obama wasn't hitting the courts, he would often catch a ride with friends to Sandy's Beach, 30 minutes drive east, and buy plate lunches from food trucks that parked near the sand, Mr. Ando says. A spokesperson for Mr. Obama didn't comment for this story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's Makiki neighbors were mostly store clerks, restaurant workers and small-business owners, many aspiring to government jobs, says DeSoto Brown, a Honolulu historian and archivist at the Bishop Museum. The area was a kind of stopover point for many second- and third-generation Asian immigrants looking to live downtown a few years before moving to a big house in new suburbs in East Honolulu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the years before Mr. Obama's return in 1971, the area, as well as much of Honolulu, had undergone a small building boom. Many of the clapboard plantation-style cottages had been bulldozed and replaced by concrete cinderblock walkups two and three stories high with open walkways, private lanais and louvered glass windows. By the late '60s, high-rise buildings were starting to muscle their way in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's grandparents moved into one of these, a building fronting Beretania, a busy six-lane road. Today, the off-white rectangular building looks outmoded. The railings of resident's lanais are rusting, bleeding brown down the corners. Mismatched plastic chairs sit around a pressboard table outside the elevator where the buildings' older residents lounge and "talk story." Out front, four coconut trees sway back and forth with the ever-present trade winds, one spindly tree leaning so much it looks as if it's about to fall over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's grandmother lived in the same apartment for nearly four decades until her death last weekend. Wellwishers left leis made of flowers, maile leaves and yarn and a strand of origami cranes in her building's lobby in remembrance.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">'Underwater' Need Not Mean Foreclosure; Why Most People Who Owe More Than a Property's Worth Will Still Keep Their Homes</span>
</div><div class="author">By Karen Blumenthal </div><div>1156 words</div><div>5 November 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Family Finances; D1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does being "underwater" in your house really mean? Probably not that you're drowning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of underwater homeowners -- those who owe more on their mortgages than their home is now worth -- has been growing sharply since 2006 as real-estate prices have tumbled. By some estimates, between one in six and one in eight homeowners are in that position, most of them people who bought homes in the past few years or who put down small or no down payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This worries economists and policy makers, since owing more than your home is worth is the first step toward foreclosure. And it's a concern to the rest of us because foreclosures are roiling the financial markets and, closer to home, they drag down our neighborhoods. (Most people who still have equity, by contrast, would rather sell their houses at a loss than lose what's left of their investment.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to concerns about rising foreclosure and delinquency rates, federal regulators are studying possible new programs aimed at needy homeowners. There are concerns that such programs could attract a flood of applications from those who don't truly need assistance or encourage lenders to push homeowners into foreclosure. At the same time, lenders such as <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> have committed to working on new loan terms for the most-distressed homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But experts who have studied previous sharp housing downturns in Texas, California, New York and Massachusetts say that being underwater, while unpleasant, doesn't lead huge numbers of homeowners to default on their mortgages and end up in foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher L. Foote, Kristopher Gerardi and Paul S. Willen of the Boston Federal Reserve Bank studied more than 100,000 homeowners who were underwater in Massachusetts in 1991 and found that just 6.4% of them lost their homes to foreclosure over the next three years, according to a paper published in the September Journal of Urban Economics. The vast majority of homeowners simply continued paying as usual because they focused on the affordability of their payments, not on what they owed, and they believed home values would eventually recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economists found that homeowners typically lost their homes only after at least two things happened: Their home values dropped and they either couldn't afford the payments or stopped making payments after losing hope that prices would eventually recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners in California also were more likely than expected to keep paying during the deep 1990s slump, says Richard Green, director of the Lusk Center for Real Estate at the University of Southern California. More people turned in their keys in Ohio and Michigan during the difficult 1980s downturn because they lost faith in an economic turnaround.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, homeowners fall behind after a job loss, divorce or serious illness. In the current downturn, foreclosures are higher than in previous cycles because more homeowners reached beyond their means to buy their homes and simply can't keep up the payments. As a result, the Boston economists project that up to 8% of underwater Massachusetts homeowners could lose their homes between now and 2010 -- a significant amount, but still not catastrophic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what does this all mean for you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you have a low-interest fixed-rate loan, you have a valuable asset that might be hard to replace in the current market, no matter what your home's value is. Keeping that mortgage current has some value, even if it means cutting other household expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the penalties for defaulting are great. In most cases, walking away from a mortgage can knock a top credit score down to the cellar, says Ethan Dornhelm, a senior scientist at <span class="companylink">Fair Isaac Corp</span>., which sells credit-scoring formulas to credit bureaus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A person with a stellar credit score from the high 700s to the top score of 850 would see it drop more than 200 points. A person whose credit score is lower may see it fall by fewer points, but still end up with a score in the mid 500s. At that level, reasonably priced new debt, from credit cards to car loans, will be out of reach. In addition, a default could lead landlords and utilities to require more cash up front and even affect your job prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the borrower continues to pay other debts on time, the score will climb gradually, though it may take three to five years to return to "good" scores, from the mid-600s and up. Scores of 790 or more -- which are rewarded with the lowest interest rates -- won't be attainable for at least seven years, when the default blemish finally disappears, Mr. Dornhelm says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> requires borrowers who have lost their homes to foreclosure to wait five years before it will accept a loan from them, though borrowers who had extenuating circumstances, such as an illness or job loss, may requalify within three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, lenders in most states can go after homeowners for an unpaid balance on a mortgage. That's a real risk, especially if you have other assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The longer you stay in your house, the better the chances of making it through this down cycle. Though a return to peak prices may take five or 10 years, some housing markets may start to bounce back once credit becomes more available. Meanwhile, you'll be reducing your mortgage as you make your payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders aren't going to renegotiate just because prices have fallen, but if you truly can't afford your payments, contact your mortgage servicer to see if you can rework your interest rate or work out new payment options. The federal Hope for Homeowners program, which began Oct. 1, is intended to provide some relief if lenders will agree to reduce the loan amount to 90% of the home's current value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you can't get help from your lender, try contacting a credit counselor certified by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. These counselors have direct access to lenders' loss-mitigation departments, which consumers don't, says Natalie Lohrenz, counseling administrator for Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Orange County, Calif. A list of HUD-certified counselors is available through Hope Now, a consortium of lenders and counselors. (Call 888-995-HOPE or go to www.hopenow.com[http://www.hopenow.com].)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you need to sell the property and can't afford to cover the shortfall, your lender may agree to a "short sale," in which you sell at a price below the mortgage amount. This is a much more complicated transaction to pull off than a regular home sale, though, and it may hurt your credit score if the lender reports that you failed to pay off the whole obligation.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi </div><div>Special to the WSJ</div>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The City of Angels' property market is looking more earthbound, as the global financial crisis is beginning to play itself out in the region's real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, real estate in and around the nation's entertainment capital already has taken some hits this year as the region's <span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">IndyMac Bancorp Inc</span>. were among the highest-profile casualties of the crisis. In addition, slumping imports into Los Angeles-area ports have hurt warehouse demand and housing prices have fallen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now brokers say the property market in and around the city is bracing for even tougher times as budget-conscious companies are looking to trim real-estate costs. Already-declining demand for office space in the Los Angeles region, one of the country's largest office markets, is expected to accelerate, says Whitley Collins, senior managing director of the Los Angeles region brokerage for <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Americas Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He sees a worst-case scenario in which metropolitan area companies over the next 12 months could put as much as 10 million square feet of office space back on the market and rents could decline by as much as 25%. "We're seeing a softening, but we're not nearly seeing the softening we'll see," Mr. Collins says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The further decline in demand would come as some companies already are shedding space or considering doing so. It still isn't clear what will happen to the leased space occupied by the Pasadena headquarters of <span class="companylink">IndyMac Federal Bank FSB</span>, as well as the bank's 33 Southern California retail branches, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. spokesman David Barr says. The FDIC in July took over the <span class="companylink">IndyMac Bancorp</span>'s banking unit, which it subsequently renamed IndyMac Federal Bank, and is seeking a buyer for it, Mr. Barr says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, a spokesman for Charlotte, N.C.-based <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>., which acquired <span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial</span> this summer, says the bank has no current plans to sell or sublease about one million square feet of former Countrywide office facilities, including the mortgage firm's former Calabasas, Calif., headquarters. Still, as leases expire in the coming months in the Calabasas-area former Countrywide facilities, pre-merger consolidation plans will go on, the spokesman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Los Angeles metropolitan area, home to about 10.7 million people, has a mix of employers that include entertainment and media companies, professional-service firms and aerospace concerns. Job levels fell by about 0.9% in September compared with the year-earlier month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the region's exclusive enclaves haven't been immune to the downshift in consumer demand hitting the country. California state sales-tax receipts in Beverly Hills rose 0.3% for the 12 months ending in June, compared with a 5.7% rise in the 12-month period ending in June 2007, according to the City of Beverly Hills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">Los Angeles Metro                           2008          2007
Office vacancy, Avg. annual rent/s.f.       13.1%, $32.47 11.7%, $31.01
Retail econ. vacancy, Avg. annual rent/s.f. 9.9%, $25.57  8.3%, $25.88
Warehouse vacancy, Avg. annual rent/s.f.    5.1%, $7.99   3.8%, $7.80
Median single-family home price             $417,800      $593,000
</pre>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the signs of the weakening real-estate market are coming as the Los Angeles commercial-leasing market is still among the country's healthiest by some measures. Of the 54 major metro-area markets surveyed by Property &amp;Portfolio Research Inc., Los Angeles's third-quarter metro-wide warehouse vacancy rate was the lowest and office vacancy rate was the seventh lowest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While office vacancies are already rising, the Los Angeles region was helped by the relatively moderate pace of new office construction and also was one of the few markets in the U.S. to see continued office rent growth through the third quarter, though regionwide rents are poised to fall going forward, PPR says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, though sale prices and the number of properties sold have plummeted with the deteriorating credit markets, as they have nationwide, the metro commercial-sales market was still one of the most liquid in the U.S. This year through the third quarter about $9.6 billion in office, retail, industrial and apartment properties valued at $5 million or more were sold, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a New York-based real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houston-based Hines, an international real-estate firm, said in September that its Hines U.S. Office Value Added Fund II LP acquired the 48-story <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> Center in downtown Los Angeles from Broadway Partners, a closely held real-estate fund manager. Broadway is selling assets in its portfolio as it faces a $750 million loan expiration in January. The <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> building fetched $280 million in September, according to Real Capital. Broadway Partners and Hines declined to comment on the transaction price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As more building owners feel the pinch of declining rents and falling values, brokers are now watching the horizon for a potential increase in foreclosures on office properties, though there has been no such rise yet, says J.C. Casillas, assistant vice president for <span class="companylink">Grubb &amp;Ellis Co</span>. in Los Angeles. "The fear is it's going to happen but there's no blood in the water now," Mr. Casillas says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks continue to tighten lending terms for U.S. consumers and businesses, hamstringing the economy and raising the risk of a protracted recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve's latest survey of banks' senior loan officers, conducted in October, showed a large majority of the 76 respondents clamped down on lending in the past three months amid mounting losses and concern about the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It means the downturn is likely to be deep and will last longer than anything we've seen in a long time," said Michael Darda, chief economist at Stamford, Conn.-based MKM Partners. "There's still a lot of pain in front of us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 95% of banks in the U.S. said they tightened price terms on commercial and industrial loans to large and midsize firms during the past three months, the Fed's survey found. A total of 85% tightened lending standards -- compared with 60% who did so in the previous three-month period, which ended in July. About 60% of U.S. banks tightened lending standards on credit-card loans and other types of consumer loans, while about half said they raised their minimum required credit scores for such loans. The moves were driven by gloomier views on the U.S. economy as well as rising loan defaults in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Declining access to credit and more stringent lending practices are casting a pall on the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report, also released Monday, found that manufacturing activity slowed sharply in October, falling to its lowest level since 1982 and dropping below the threshold that signals the U.S. is in recession. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing activity sank to 38.9 last month from 43.5 in September. Exports, a key source of strength for the sector, collapsed last month after nearly six years of growth as global demand softened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a special set of questions in the ISM survey, just over half of respondents, 52.9%, said they or their suppliers have been affected by the recent financial-market turmoil. Of those affected, about 45% reported decreased availability of credit, 41% saw higher credit costs and a quarter said they had difficulty initiating or renewing a bank credit line. More than three-quarters of respondents said they reduced spending and/or hiring after recent turmoil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's more and more evidence that this recession will be as bad as the early 1980s," said Harm Bandholz, a New York-based economist with <span class="companylink">UniCredit</span>. Mr. Bandholz expects layoffs and unemployment to increase in coming months, with a further 200,000 job losses in October, the most this year, when the government reports its tally on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing report showed that employment in the sector shrank for the third month in a row, suggesting the industry could face further layoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The October manufacturing decline crossed below the 41.1 level that historically has signaled the U.S. economy is in recession, with all the index's components showing severe weakness. Some of the softening was tied to hurricane-related declines in production, the survey noted, but a broader drop in demand for manufactured goods -- which often accompanies economic downturns -- was the key culprit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index of new orders, a leading sign of future manufacturing activity, fell by more than six points to 32.2, its lowest level since the deep recession in the early 1980s, while production took a similar dive. Exports eased to 41 in October from 52 in September, ending nearly six years of uninterrupted growth and suggesting a pillar of U.S. manufacturing activity is faltering as the global economy flirts with recession. Imports also decreased, a sign U.S. demand for foreign goods -- a much-needed market for many struggling economies -- continues to slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices paid by manufacturers continued to slide. That index soared to a reading of 88.5 in July as oil and gasoline prices hit record highs, but fell to 37 in October, the lowest reading since December 2001. Cooling prices are a sign that inflation is no longer a pressing concern in the industry. Lower inflation worries and slowing global demand have given central banks in the U.S. and abroad leeway to cut interest rates in an effort to stimulate economies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory levels crept higher, a sign that orders will continue to be weak in coming months. Manufacturers' inventories rose by about a point to a level of 44.3, while their customers' inventories rose to 55, suggesting some accumulation of goods as demand has evaporated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the U.S. Commerce Department reported that construction spending declined at a 0.3% seasonally adjusted annual rate in September, better than expected amid financial turmoil that month. Residential construction spending continued its long decline, falling at a 1.3% pace, while nonresidential spending eked out a 0.1% annualized gain. Private-sector spending rose at a 0.1% pace in September, thanks to growth in nonresidential spending on things such as education and transportation, while public-sector spending dropped at a 1.3% pace.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks continue to tighten lending terms for the nation's consumers and businesses, hamstringing the economy and raising the risk of a protracted recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve's latest survey of banks' senior loan officers showed that a large majority of the 76 U.S. and foreign-based respondents clamped down on lending in the past three months amid mounting losses and concern about the nation's economy. Also, separate reports Monday showed manufacturing activity slowed, and construction spending fell, though not as steeply as expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It means the downturn is likely to be deep and will last longer than anything we've seen in a long time," said Michael Darda, chief economist at Stamford, Conn.-based MKM Partners. "There's still a lot of pain in front of us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 95% of banks in the U.S. said they tightened price terms on commercial and industrial loans to large and midsize firms in the past three months, according to the Fed survey. A total of 85% tightened lending standards, compared with 60% in the previous three-month period, which ended in July. Roughly 60% of U.S. banks tightened lending standards on credit-card loans and other types of consumer loans, while about half said they raised the minimum required credit scores for such loans. The survey, which was conducted in October, found that the moves were driven by more pessimistic views on the U.S. economy as well as rising loan defaults in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of Florida Corp</span>. Chief Executive Michael McMullan said he is seeing many rival banks that "are literally out of the lending business right now." While his Fort Myers-based bank, with 13 branches and about $1.4 billion in assets, is still making loans, it turned down "well over" $100 million of applications in the third quarter, he said. Mr. McMullan said some aspiring borrowers didn't meet the bank's eligibility standards or couldn't afford the rates it charged on loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. banks noted tightening in both the maximum size and maturity of loans and credit lines to businesses. Some 75% reported stricter lending standards for home equity lines of credit; 70% tightened standards on prime mortgages; 85% said they tightened lending standards on commercial-real-estate loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This pushes any kind of trough in the economy until late next year," Mr. Darda said, noting that tight credit, falling equity and real-estate wealth and rising unemployment make it unlikely that consumer spending, the largest driver of U.S. economic growth, will rebound soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difficult credit environment is apparent at <span class="companylink">Next Inc</span>., which received a lukewarm response from two of the nation's biggest banks when it needed a new credit facility. The Chattanooga, Tenn., company is now negotiating with a smaller lender for a new line of credit. "It's a very tough landscape, particularly for a small company like us," said David Cole, chief financial officer of Next, which makes promotional products and imprinted sportswear for universities and other organizations.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ANTIOCH, Calif. -- When the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. seized control of <span class="companylink">IndyMac Bancorp</span> -- the nation's 10th-largest mortgage lender by loan volume -- the agency vowed to ease terms for many of its troubled borrowers. In doing so, the FDIC wanted to show the mortgage industry how it could slash home foreclosures by making decisions both sensible and humane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new entity, called IndyMac Federal Bank, has become a laboratory test of whether the FDIC's program can keep people in their homes. While it has already seen some success, the agency has also run into obstacles familiar to private lenders and loan servicers. The upshot: there are no easy solutions to the foreclosure crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FDIC launched its aid program in August, five weeks after the government took over IndyMac, which failed under the weight of its bad real-estate lending. The agency found plenty of bad loans to work with. IndyMac's specialty was Alt-A mortgages, a category that frequently includes loans made with little or no documentation and exaggerated borrower incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our goal is to get the greatest recovery possible on loans in default or in danger of default, while helping troubled borrowers remain in their homes," said FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bair has emerged at the forefront of the public debate over how to keep people from losing their homes and has jawboned the Bush administration to make more aggressive efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In total, IndyMac services about 653,000 mortgage loans on behalf of itself and other investors. About 65,100 are "seriously delinquent," generally meaning at least 60 days late. Of those, the FDIC says roughly 47,000 might meet its criteria for a new loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FDIC has already completed loan modifications for 3,500 borrowers. Several thousand more have accepted the FDIC's offer, though their modifications are still being processed. On average, those who have renegotiated have seen monthly house payments cut by more than $380, or about 23%, the FDIC says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the agency has had difficulty getting responses from some borrowers. It's walled off from renegotiating some loans that were sold to other investors. And it still has to engage in thorny decisions of who deserves help and who doesn't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not that the FDIC has helped everybody or that it's a perfect process, but it's really dramatically different," says Adam Kruggel, director of the Contra Costa Interfaith Supporting Community Organization, a faith-based group advocating for homeowner protections. He believes no other lender has approached the problem in such a systematic fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bair is now pushing a separate plan, close to being finalized by the White House, in which the federal government would help keep borrowers in their homes by absorbing a portion of any losses on a modified loan. That could help as many as three million homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FDIC says its goal is to reduce the cost of IndyMac's failure by increasing the value of its portfolio. "This is not a social program," says FDIC special adviser for policy Michael Krimminger. "This is about maximizing the value of the mortgages. That will also help keep more people in their homes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FDIC has said it expects losses on IndyMac to total $8.9 billion. But the cost to the insurer could be lower if the loan-modification program is successful, FDIC officials say. In that case, bids for IndyMac assets may come in higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mixed results of the IndyMac experiment are visible throughout Contra Costa County, a heavily Hispanic area where reckless lending -- and reckless borrowing -- fueled tracts of development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Antioch, a city of some 100,000 residents, 1,137 homeowners were in default this month. More than 2,100 homes are already back in bank hands, the most in the county.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jaime Aguilar, a 37-year-old truck driver in Antioch, stopped making his house payments in August. In early October IndyMac offered to switch him from an interest-only loan into one that would permit him to pay off some principal -- and cut his monthly payments by $336 for the next five years. He signed up immediately. He's still delinquent on a second home loan from <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp;Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luis Flores, a 30-year-old bartender from Oakley, has watched the balance on his adjustable mortgage balloon from $424,000 to $463,000 in three years, while the value of his house dropped from $530,000 to less than half that. Twice he has sent proposals to IndyMac detailing how much he can afford to pay. But the bank, he says, hasn't given him serious consideration. (A bank spokesman said he couldn't comment on Mr. Flores's specific situation, but said that IndyMac is able to do more for borrowers now than it was even a few weeks ago.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Flores family, which fears eviction, is now looking for a place to rent. In his mortgage file, Mr. Flores keeps a note that reads:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Take deep breath daily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Talk with wife about stress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most mortgage companies revise loan terms -- a process called modification -- one by one, a costly and time-consuming process. The FDIC's innovation was to create a comprehensive program with clear guidelines. It reworks delinquent loans so that a borrower's monthly payments for principal, interest, taxes and insurance equal no more than 38% of his or her income. To do this, the FDIC will first reduce the borrower's interest rate. In addition, it may extend the loan term and, where it can, base monthly payments on a smaller loan balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FDIC reviews information from tax returns to document borrowers' incomes before any deal is finalized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late August, the FDIC mailed 7,500 letters to delinquent borrowers for whom IndyMac had recent financial information. The missive was an offer to reduce monthly payments. Roughly three-quarters of recipients responded. In the past three weeks, the FDIC mailed offers to another 7,500 borrowers for whom it also has financial information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the FDIC has sent letters to another 19,000 borrowers for whom it had no recent financial information. It asked them to get in touch with IndyMac and provide financial information to determine if they qualify for a fast-track modification. So far, just 10% have responded, less than what the FDIC would like to see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One lesson the FDIC learned, Mr. Krimminger says, is that "if you tell them what their new monthly payment is going to be, they are much more likely to respond."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many borrowers complain they have a hard time getting IndyMac to respond to their pleas for help. When they do make contact, they're often told they can't get assistance unless they're already delinquent on their payments. (The FDIC says that it is working to address any concerns about IndyMac's responsiveness to borrowers.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If it was easy, everyone [in the mortgage business]would have done it already," says Mr. Krimminger. He says the FDIC's project demonstrates it is possible to modify thousands of mortgages simultaneously -- something the industry has struggled to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are limits to what the FDIC can and will do. The agency says it will modify loans through the streamlined program only for borrowers living in the property. (The idea is to avoid rewarding real-estate speculators.) It also won't rework a loan if it can get a better return from foreclosing on the property and then selling it. About one in four delinquent loans fails this test.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, the FDIC has less flexibility in cases where IndyMac doesn't own the loans but acts as a collection agent for investors who own mortgages or mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nanci Puerto, a 40-year-old house cleaner in Antioch, ran into such a problem. She refinanced her house for $637,288 from IndyMac in 2006, taking out cash for a down payment on another property. She and her husband, who works in a machine shop, take home a combined $70,000 a year. Each month, she makes the minimum payment on her loan, $2,416. At the same time, she watches the outstanding principal swell since that payment doesn't fully cover the interest costs. Now she owes IndyMac $707,000, on a house that the county tax assessor says is only worth $410,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she called the bank, however, she says the agent told her IndyMac is just a "collector" for the investors who own her mortgage. The bank could only consider altering her mortgage terms if she were delinquent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm going to stop paying so they'll modify the loan," Ms. Puerto said this week. "Otherwise they won't help me."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FDIC can work with borrowers who are likely to become delinquent if IndyMac owns the loans. In cases where it does not own the loan, the bank's contracts allow it to intervene only if borrowers are actually delinquent. It can't do anything to help borrowers who haven't yet missed a payment, even if a default is in the cards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Krimminger described that limitation as "one of the frustrations" that FDIC is experiencing at the helm of IndyMac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bertha and Nicolas Bobadilla, of Brentwood, a town not far from Antioch, are making their payments but don't think they can hold on for much longer. There's not much the FDIC can do. Mrs. Bobadilla, 45, is an out-of-work house cleaner, while Mr. Bobadilla earns about $36,000 a year as a tree trimmer. In recent years, the couple borrowed heavily to buy houses for various family members, a bet that depended on ever-rising house prices. One home has already gone back to the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bobadillas are scraping together enough to make the roughly $1,607 monthly payments on a three-bedroom house in Redding, their likely fallback residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Bobadilla has unsuccessfully sought IndyMac's help on several occasions. Trying again this week, she was twice disconnected. When she got through to a Spanish-speaking agent, he told her: "Your only option is to refinance, ma'am." And he warned her that if the house is worth less than the existing mortgage -- a certainty -- she'd only be able to refinance if she paid the difference up front, something she can't afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But I heard on TV that you have a new program" to help borrowers, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That program is only for those who are behind on their payments," the agent told her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Krimminger said the FDIC strongly discourages borrowers from skipping payments in the hopes they will qualify for aid. "We are taking every step we can to make sure that call center people are providing accurate information to consumers," he said, "but we can't control every conversation between call-center employees and borrowers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers who are delinquent won't qualify for a loan modification if the FDIC determines they can afford their payments, he says. Those who fall behind are likely to ruin their credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rafael Martinez is a 31-year-old stucco worker in Pittsburg, Calif. earning $3,600 per month at his union job. He has two IndyMac loans that ballooned to $420,000. He originally borrowed $400,000. His wife lost her job and he hasn't made a payment on either loan since March. He figured the house was lost. In hopes of saving his credit rating, he arranged a $150,000 short sale in which the bank would agree to cancel his mortgage in exchange for the proceeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the sale closed, a housing counselor contacted IndyMac on his behalf. On Sept. 25, the day after what was to have been his foreclosure date, IndyMac sent him a letter that read: "If you are eligible, we may be able to permanently modify your mortgage, bring past due amounts current, and provide you with an affordable monthly payment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's optimistic the FDIC will accept his application. It is, he figures, in the bank's best interest, too. His neighborhood is pocked with empty homes, their yards gone as brown as the wild hills visible over the rooftops. One family around the corner simply disappeared one day. Not long ago he saw someone break into a house vacated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Posted in the living-room window of a vacant down the street is a sign saying: "This home is protected by <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span>." <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span>, a big North Carolina bank, almost failed recently and has agreed to be bought by <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every other day or so, Mr. Martinez's wife asks him: "When are we leaving the house?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think we are leaving the house," Mr. Martinez responds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a safe at a relative's house, he has socked away money he saved by not paying IndyMac. He says he's ready to turn it over to the bank when they come to an agreement on an affordable mortgage.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Christina S.N. Lewis </div><div>980 words</div><div>31 October 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; W8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the luxury real-estate market slows to a snail's pace, real-estate brokers find themselves struggling to sell a growing number of "trophy homes" that are quietly gaining a new title: white elephants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The term hails from a legend that Siamese royalty gave albino elephants -- revered but financially ruinous to maintain -- to unpleasant courtiers. Today, the financial burden of carrying an overly big, overly unique manse is being shared by many wealthy owners, who are finding out the hard way that not everyone is willing to pay up for their vision of a dream home. Realtors concede a growing number of these pricey pachyderms are sitting unsold for months and selling at steep discounts, if at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some sellers are getting creative. On Thursday, the owners of Castlewood, a gothic castle in West Orange, N.J., hosted a live jousting competition to generate buzz among real-estate brokers. Designed in the 1850s, the 5,000-square-foot stone house is on two acres and features two towers, a staff apartment and a round bedchamber with a 28-foot-high domed ceiling. On the market for two years, the homeowners switched to a new agent, Sam Joseph of Re/Max Village Square and dropped the asking price to $2 million from $2.8 million, originally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most of the housing market's history, homeowners knew that big custom-designed homes that aren't in scale with their environs might eventually cost them. "You build [a white elephant] because you were successful in your career and you want to treat yourself," says Ed Kaminsky, who runs Premiere Estates, a California-based luxury auctioneer that specializes in marketing unique, hard-to-value houses. "But you can't expect to get your money out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it seems that tenet was forgotten during the boom. And in the meantime, formerly profligate consumers have become extremely price-conscious, says Gregory Hague, owner of Arizona-based Hague Partners, an affiliate of Christie's Great Estates. "It used to be that buyers looked for something that got them excited and emotionally engaged and then tried to negotiate a good deal. Now they're looking at price first."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven L. Good, head of Chicago-based real-estate auction firm <span class="companylink">Sheldon Good &amp;Co</span>., says the division of the company that specializes in selling homes that cost from $1.5 million up to $40 million has seen a sharp increase in offerings in the last year from wealthy homeowners who are frustrated because their homes aren't selling. And real-estate Web site Zillow.com turns up a number of unsold homes whose price tags and amenities are far fancier than their immediate environs might suggest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Broadview, a Seattle neighborhood known mostly for modest ranch houses, an Italian-style villa for sale features a four-car garage and an indoor koi pond. Nearly 10,000 square feet, the house has an asking price of $2.75 million and has been on the market for over a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barney Garton, the listing agent, says the home's rare Puget Sound views make it "a great value." He says it hasn't sold because of its "unusual" architecture and the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Truckee, Calif., a lake community about 17 miles north of Lake Tahoe, a $3.95 million lakefront contemporary house with an elevator, indoor lap pool and two garages stands out from the neighboring A-frame log cabins. Built in 1985 and designed by the owner's son, an architect, it was listed in June and is the most expensive house for sale on the lake. While it's received less traffic than expected, the owner is in no hurry to sell, says one of the listing agents, Charles White, of Donner Lake Realty. A more recently remodeled home with fewer amenities but more lake frontage recently sold for about $3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Dallas, Braden Power, a developer of apartment complexes, spent more than seven years designing and building his dream house: an 8,500-square-foot showpiece with contemporary, traditional and Moorish influences that opens to a central "natatorium," a double-height entrance courtyard with marble floors, two fireplaces, a mezzanine balcony and a central fountain and reflecting pool deep enough to swim in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Power spared no expense: He hired an army of both traditional and contemporary designers. The automated exterior and interior lighting systems cost $500,000; the chandeliers are hand-carved, the floors are all solid marble or limestone (both indoor and outdoor) with radiant heating -- a rarity in Dallas where the temperature seldom dips below 40 degrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This house was basically a creative outlet," says Mr. Power, who says his inspirations were the Los Angeles and Miami boutique hotels designed by Ian Schrager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But last year, Mr. Power decided the home was too big for a bachelor and he put it up for sale, unfinished. With a price tag of $13 million, it attracted a flurry of local press.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite being located on three-quarters of an acre on picturesque Turtle Creek, the home didn't sell and now Mr. Power has relisted the house for $9.8 million with Doris Jacobs, of Allie Beth Allman &amp;Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Mr. Power acknowledges that he may not recoup his building and carrying costs, he says the home will become a good investment if fans of the design purchase his architectural plans and custom molds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has no regrets about building the house. "Honestly, this house is a dream to me," says Mr. Power, who also plans to list the home for rent. "I think it's the most perfect place that I've ever been in in my life."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plunging real-estate values have made it an opportune time for older homeowners to give property to their children, while realizing big savings on gift and estate taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They can do this by moving the home out of their estate with a so-called qualified personal residence trust, or QPRT, which allows homeowners to live in a property for many years before passing it on to their heirs. Though the trusts have been around for many years, many estate planners say now could be a good time to set one up since real-estate values have fallen dramatically in many markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QPRTs are one of a number of strategies that wealth advisers and estate planners are recommending as clients cope with beaten-down financial markets and a nasty real-estate landscape. The goal: Put beaten-down assets into trusts now and reap benefits from their appreciation outside of your estate. With real-estate values low, executing a QPRT now ensures your estate won't contain a more-expensive home down the road, which could trigger a costly tax bill for your estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most estate planners say activity on QPRTs remains quiet these days amid uncertainty over the direction of the estate tax and investors' timidity in parting with assets during a bear market. But these same wealth advisers say conditions could be ripe -- now and in the months ahead -- for executing these trusts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By transferring your home into a QPRT (often pronounced CUE-pert) when the value of your home is most likely at a low point, you're effectively locking in a lower gift-tax amount when you move the home into the trust. And if interest rates move higher in the months ahead, that discount could be even greater because of the special method the Internal Revenue Service uses to compute the home's gift-tax value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're probably heading to a time where it might be a perfect storm" of market conditions that make it the time to set up a QPRT, says Janine Racanelli, head of the Advice Lab at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Henry "Terry" Christensen III, a lawyer at <span class="companylink">McDermott Will &amp;Emery</span> LLP, says his firm executed about 50% more QPRTs earlier this year than it did two years ago. Mr. Christensen says that the trusts are especially popular in California and Florida, where home prices have dropped the most.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nuts and Bolts of a QPRT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's how a QPRT works: Say you're 60 years old and own a $1 million home. You'd like to leave the home to your children, but worry the property could jack up the value of your estate, perhaps pushing it high enough to trigger the estate tax. (The basic federal estate-tax exemption is $2 million per person for 2008, with the top estate-tax rate at 45%.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To move the asset out of your estate, you can put the home into a QPRT for a term of 10 years (terms can be longer or shorter, depending on your situation). For those 10 years, your living arrangements don't change -- you live in the home and pay all the expenses, including property taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because you've given the home to a QPRT, you'll have to file a gift-tax return that year, but you stand to benefit from a complex IRS formula that actually discounts your gift amount when you move the home into the trust. Assuming that value doesn't push you over your $1 million lifetime gift-tax exemption, you won't have to pay taxes at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The formula, among other things, considers your age, the IRS's current applicable federal rate of 3.8%, which is the federal interest rate used to set up trusts or loans to relatives, and the 10-year length of the trust. Assuming your home appreciates 4% a year, the formula can nearly halve the value of your house for gift-tax purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After 10 years, the home transfers to your beneficiaries, usually your children. At this point, they own the home, and it's outside your estate and won't be subjected to estate taxes. In this example, when the QPRT expires, your home is worth nearly $1.5 million. Assuming you live well into your 70s or 80s, it's likely to be worth even more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you wish to remain in the home, you'll have to pay fair-market rent to your kids, or risk running afoul of the IRS, which could scrutinize your children for allowing rent-free use of the property. When you die, your children keep the house and don't have to pay inheritance taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A QPRT at Work</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1986, Tom and Margie Williams of Columbus, Ohio, bought a lakeside cottage on Walloon Lake in Petoskey, Mich., near the northern tip of the state. Over the years, the couple and their three daughters spent summers there and used the spot for Christmas reunions. The home also had some historical value: Built in 1875, it stands in a lakeside community where Ernest Hemingway spent time as a child.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Williamses entered their 60s, they sought estate-planning advice, determined to keep a property near and dear to them in the family without burdening their children with a bigger estate-tax bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1996, the couple turned the $300,000 home over to a QPRT for a 10-year term. At the time, the applicable federal rate was 7.6%. The value of the cottage for gift-tax purposes was only about $120,000. The couple were nowhere near exceeding their lifetime $1 million gift-tax exemption, so they didn't have to pay taxes on the transfer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, the home passed to their children, who now collect rent from the couple in exchange for their right to use the home. "I always tell Margie, 'Check with the landlord,'" when something goes wrong, says the 73-year-old Mr. Williams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Williamses passed more money to their daughters through other maneuvers in the hope that they'll maintain the home for years to come. "They've kept it this long," says Margie Williams, "and they won't have to pay the inheritance taxes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Quirks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These trusts have some quirks. If you die before the trust term expires, the home reverts to your estate, nullifying any potential estate-tax savings. Because of this rule, it's essential to take stock of your age and health when drawing up the trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also remember that a QPRT is an irrevocable trust, meaning you have to give up the home when the term ends. That type of planning can be tricky -- it's sometimes hard to predict what your relationship with your children will be one or two decades down the line, and there's no guarantee your beneficiaries will let you stay in the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, a QPRT makes sense only if you anticipate your assets will exceed the estate-tax exemption when you die. In 2009, that exemption jumps to $3.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax is set to vanish in 2010, and then return in 2011 with a lower $1 million exemption and a 55% top rate. But most estate planners are betting Congress will revise the current structure. Both presidential candidates want to keep the estate tax, though with different exemptions and tax rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to uncertainty surrounding the estate tax, some estate planners discourage QPRTs at times like these, when interest rates, including the applicable federal rate, are low. That's because you get a greater discount on your gift-tax value when the rate is higher. But other advisers tell clients not to focus too much on the rate, especially if your home's value has declined significantly in the past year or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think the idea that they're only attractive when interest rates are high is just a myth," says Natalie Choate, a Boston estate-planning lawyer and author of a widely used book on QPRTs. "If you wait until interest rates are high, it may be too late because of your health or because the house has appreciated dramatically."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(See Corrections &amp;Amplifications item below [cx])</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underscoring the deepening woes in commercial real estate, a high-profile British developer has defaulted on a $365 million loan for prime land it bought in Beverly Hills last year as part of a plan to build luxury condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, CPC Group Ltd., founded by Christian Candy of London's Candy &amp;Candy development-management firm, has been roiled by the collapse of its partner in the project, Iceland's <span class="companylink">Kaupthing Bank</span>, which was taken over by the Icelandic government. It also has faced a lack of construction financing as banks have pulled back from a fast-deteriorating market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CPC sought to modify or extend its loan, which matured early this month. But its efforts faltered, and <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group</span>, acting as agent for a group of creditors, on Wednesday filed a notice of default in the office of the Los Angeles County registrar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move is the first step toward foreclosure, though it doesn't preclude the parties from continuing negotiations toward salvaging the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A CPC spokeswoman didn't respond to phone calls seeking comment. <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The default signals the widening fallout of the credit crunch and property crisis, which began last year with single-family homes and is choking off financing for commercial properties from New York office towers to Las Vegas hotels to condominium complexes coast to coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As in the Beverly Hills case, developers take out short-term land loans with the expectation of replacing them with a construction loan. That replacement financing has dried up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project in question, on the site of a former Robinsons-May department store, is one of three proposed condominium developments in the exclusive Los Angeles-area enclave that could be at risk. A nearby condo tower has been put on hold because of funding lost due to the collapse of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, a contentious Beverly Hills ballot initiative that will be put to voters Tuesday will decide the fate of the proposed construction of a Waldorf-Astoria hotel and condo complex at the site of the Beverly Hilton hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These sites are as primo as they come, and even these deals are being dragged down," said Lewis Feldman, a real-estate lawyer with Goodwin Procter in Los Angeles. "Construction financing today is almost impossible to secure."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British brothers Christian and Nick Candy have spearheaded a number of high-end property projects, and the Candy-led venture in Beverly Hills typified their optimism during the recent property boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CPC bought the eight-acre site, wedged between Wilshire and Santa Monica boulevards, for $500 million in April 2007. Just four years earlier, the parcel had traded hands for less than $50 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CPC chose to retain previous plans for 252 condominiums designed by architect Richard Meier. This past April, the Beverly Hills City Council approved zoning plans for the mixed-used project. But, to move ahead, CPC needed construction financing to replace the short-term land-acquisition loan secured from <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it scrambled to negotiate a loan extension with the syndicate of creditors, CPC raised the possibility of amending the Beverly Hills project to add a hotel component, in the hope that that would make it more viable in the current climate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beverly Hills officials said they haven't received a formal proposal, but that any significant changes would require a new approval process.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Sales at Meritage Homes Decline by 28% in Texas</span>
</div><div class="author">By Dawn Wotapka </div><div>711 words</div><div>29 October 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Business; B6C</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For months, <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>. has counted on Texas to carry it through the housing slump. But in its third quarter, the home builder paid the price for that strategy: Sales plummeted 28% in the Lone Star State, contributing to the company's sixth consecutive quarterly loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Scottsdale, Ariz.-based builder said its loss widened because of write-downs on its real estate because of the housing market's continued weakness. Also, sales in Texas were affected by Hurricane Ike, not so much by direct physical damage but by delaying construction, closings and sales as the credit crisis widened. Arizona was the only state where the company saw gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it waits for the housing market to hit bottom, Meritage has become dependent on Texas, which didn't become frenzied during the housing boom and, until now, had benefited from surging oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its second quarter, Meritage said orders fell 28% outside of Texas, but slipped just 4% in the state, where it operates in Dallas/Ft. Worth, Austin, San Antonio and Houston. That's why, as of Sept. 30, more than half of its roughly 21,000 lots were in Texas, compared with 29% in Arizona and 1% in Colorado, with 28% owned. Earlier this year, a home-building consultant labeled the state a "lifeline."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not any more. "Unlike prior quarters, sales volumes in Texas were down in line with the company average and, in turn, didn't offset weakness in harder-hit housing markets," noted <span class="companylink">UBS</span>' David Goldberg. "We expect this trend to continue over the near term, given the impact the slowdown in the economy is having on buyer sentiment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JMP Securities noted Texas's margins could come under pressure in a weaker job market. "The relatively low wage level and FICO scores in the Texas market have also slowed that market, although we see only modest price corrections likely," noted analyst James Wilson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, company executives said no strategy shift is imminent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the credit crisis seems to have pushed the world into a recession, the already battered home-building industry is feeling a deeper pain. The industry's confidence is at a record low and, after some homes sold below replacement cost, new construction has largely been halted. Earlier this month, the Commerce Department said new construction dropped 6.3% in September to the slowest pace since January 1991.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major builders -- including <span class="companylink">Pulte Homes</span>, <span class="companylink">Ryland Group Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">NVR</span> -- recently detailed grim quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meritage, which had delivered one of the industry's best year-to-date returns, reported a wider net loss of $144 million, or $4.69 a share, compared with a loss of $118.6 million, or $4.52 a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest results included $55 million of pretax real-estate-related charges and a $106 million deferred tax asset valuation allowance. <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> estimates $305 million in further charges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meritage's impairments were elevated in the third quarter, but well below last year's third and fourth quarters. Of the latest impairments, $29 million were in Arizona -- fueled by four underperforming projects in Phoenix -- followed by $11 million in California. Nevada and Florida each had $4 million, while Texas came in at $2 million. As inventory and land prices have plummeted, the top public builders have written off more than $25 billion since 2006, according to <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> Equity Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While Hurricane Ike hurt our Houston operations in early September, the financial crisis and slowing economy have damaged buyers confidence and resulted in further decline in home sales and asset values which prompted us to record further real estate impairment in our third quarter," said Steven J. Hilton, chairman and chief executive officer, during the earnings conference call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The builder said closing revenue dropped 35% to $374.8 million. Net orders fell 29%, while closings dropped 25%. As jittery buyers abandon deals, cancellations came in at 40%, up from this year's two previous quarters. Its September net sales were about 30% lower than the July/August pace -- the cancellation rate jumped to 45% that month alone, executives said during the call.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>1226 words</div><div>28 October 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; D1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower home prices are luring some buyers back into the U.S. housing market, but foreclosures and a weakening economy are likely to keep downward pressure on prices for at least another year, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A quarterly Wall Street Journal survey of housing data in 28 major metro areas shows that the glut of unsold homes listed for sale is shrinking in most of them. In many cases, sales have been stimulated by investors who are grabbing what they see as bargains on homes that can be turned into rentals. Metro areas with the biggest drops in for-sale signs include Sacramento and Orange County in California and the Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent headlines give a mixed picture. On Monday, the Census Bureau reported that new home sales in September were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 464,000 units, down 33% from September 2007. The median sales price for new homes in September was $218,400, down 9% from a year earlier. Last week, the National Association of Realtors said sales of previously occupied homes in September edged up 1.4% from the depressed year-earlier level, the first such rise since November 2005, largely reflecting sales of foreclosed homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing analysts caution that many homes that aren't currently listed for sale may hit the market in the next year or two. This looming supply includes pending foreclosures and homes temporarily taken off the market while their owners await stronger demand. With banks chopping prices on foreclosed homes, other sellers "are giving up and taking their homes off of the market," says Michael Lyon, president of Trendgraphix Inc., a research firm in Sacramento.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, credit remains tight, consumer confidence is crumbling, and job losses are removing some potential buyers from the market while pushing others toward foreclosure. "Now we're adding a second leg down [in housing], which is the job losses," says Kenneth Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates jumped Monday amid continued turmoil in the credit markets. Some mortgage firms quoted rates of 6.5% or more for standard 30-year fixed-rate loans. That was up from an average of 6.2% last week, according to HSH Associates, a financial publisher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite all the gloom, some people believe it isn't too early to pick up bargains. One key, they say, is a deep understanding of the local demand for rental housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dinesh and Rima Kumar, who live in Ashburn, Va., last month bought a town house in Sterling, Va., a suburb of Washington, D.C., for $154,000. The same home sold in June 2005 for $375,000 to a buyer who used subprime loans to finance 100% of the price. It went into foreclosure late last year. Mr. Kumar says he has found a renter at $1,500 a month. The Kumars, who paid cash for the home, calculate their monthly expenses -- including taxes, insurance, maintenance and fees -- at $491 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple made the plunge partly because Ms. Kumar, a real-estate agent for Realty Direct, noticed that homes in the area priced at $250,000 or less were attracting multiple offers. Home sales in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington totaled 3,360 in September, up 92% from a year earlier, according to the Northern Virginia Association of Realtors. The average price: about $333,000, down 32% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This could be the bottom," Mr. Kumar says, and even if it isn't, "the down side on a $150,000 property is pretty low." Moreover, he has been burned in the past by stock-market investments and thinks rental income will far exceed the meager interest rates offered on bank deposits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real Property Investment Group LLC of Atlanta recently bought a three-bedroom house in Snellville, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta, for $50,000. The home had sold in March 2007 for $116,900 and went into foreclosure a year later. The latest sale price is only modestly above the $45,800 price the home fetched when it was newly built in 1981, according to RealQuest.com, a data service of First American CoreLogic Inc. Charlie Chico, managing partner of Real Property Investment, estimates that the home can be rented out for $900 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Chico notes that foreclosed homes aren't necessarily bargains. "You have to be picky," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though housing demand increases over the long run with population, it may be tepid in the next year or two. In hard times, notes Jay Brinkmann, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, many young people move in with parents or find roommates, reducing the rate at which new households are formed. Mr. Brinkmann also expects a further rise in foreclosures over the next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> estimates that banks and loan investors owned 826,200 foreclosed homes as of Sept. 1, up from 343,500 a year earlier. <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> forecasts that this inventory will peak at around 1.3 million homes in mid-2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ivy Zelman, chief executive of housing-research firm Zelman &amp;Associates, says far more vacant homes are being held off the market than usual. In the second quarter, vacant homes that weren't listed for sale totaled about 6.5 million, she estimates, using Census Bureau data. That's about one million more than the typical level during the first half of this decade. If a million of those vacant homes were listed for sale, listings would rise about 23% from the current level. Some of these empty homes are in the foreclosure process, Ms. Zelman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on the S&amp;P Case-Shiller national home-price index, prices on average already were down about 18% in this year's second quarter from the peak two years before. Celia Chen, director of housing economics at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com, expects a further drop of about 14% before prices bottom out in the second half of 2009. Prices won't bottom out everywhere at the same time, of course. Ms. Chen expects Florida's recovery to lag behind that of the nation as a whole, partly because a backlog of foreclosures in courts there will take time to clear. In the Miami area, nearly 18% of home mortgages are overdue or in foreclosure, compared with a national average of 7%, according to Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The glut of homes in South Florida is concentrated on the lower end of the market, says Ron Shuffield, president of Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell Inc., a big real-estate brokerage there. Homes priced at less than $300,000 account for about 62% of the single-family houses and condos listed for sale in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, up from 33% in April 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But consumer confidence is lacking. As stock prices lurched downward in recent weeks, "the phone stopped ringing," says Tip Powers, president of Realty Direct, Ashburn, Va. Some people tempted to invest in real estate were suddenly too jumpy -- or had lost in the stock market the money they intended to put into property.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- As the median sales price for new homes slipped to its lowest level in four years, sales of single-family homes increased by 2.7% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 464,000, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had forecast a September sales rate of 455,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in most regions of the country declined or remained virtually flat, while the West saw a 22.7% increase in new home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the market for new homes remains particularly weak in this housing crisis, with builders finding it hard to compete with low-priced foreclosed properties. Overall, sales activity remains significantly depressed compared to the roughly 1.4 million peak set in July 2005 for new home sales, experts noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The current pace of sales is extremely slow and may not hold up into October as the credit crunch intensified and consumers became increasingly worried about the economic outlook," wrote <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> economic analyst Adam York in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, analysts were skeptical after a government report Friday showed existing-home sales activity climbed to its highest level in more than a year. While the data seemed to be a promising sign for the battered housing market, experts questioned whether the rebound was sustainable given the tight labor market and tight credit conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just a month earlier, in August, new-home sales decreased by 12.6% to an annual rate of 452,000; originally, the government said August sales decreased by 11.5% to 460,000, a 17-year low. July sales rose 3.6% to 517,000; earlier, Commerce estimated July rose 4.0% to 520,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year over year, new-home sales were 33.1% lower than the level in September 2007. Mortgage credit has tightened. High inventory of unsold homes is hurting the housing market, and the rest of the economy. The surplus is driving prices down. Falling prices, in turn, are keeping would-be buyers from signing on the dotted line as they wait for a better deal. Builders are breaking new ground at a declining rate, discouraged by excess supply and declining sales. The housing slump has detracted from economic growth as measured by gross domestic product for two-and-a-half years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a new home decreased by 9.1% to $218,400 in September from $240,300 in September 2007. The median price last month marks the lowest median sales price since September 2004. The average price tumbled 5.7% from $292,200 in September 2007 to $275,500 last month. In August, the median price was $220,400 and the average was $264,100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories proved to be a bright spot in the government report, falling 7.3% to an estimated 394,000 homes for sale at the end of September from August's 425,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is an encouraging development because inventory of completed homes will be the most difficult to clear," wrote <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> economist Michelle Meyer. "Nonetheless, inventory is still too high, accounting for 10.4 months of supply at the current dismal sales pace."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally last month, new-home sales were up 22.7% in the West, down 21.4% in the Northeast, down 5.8% in the Midwest and up 0.7% in the South.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW-HOME sales in the U.S. made a surprising jump last month from a 17-year low in August, a government report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes increased by 2.7% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 464,000 from August's revised rate of 452,000, the Commerce Department said. Economists had forecast a September sales rate of 455,000.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>1221 words</div><div>28 October 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower home prices are luring some buyers back into the U.S. housing market, but foreclosures and a weakening economy are likely to keep downward pressure on prices for at least another year, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A quarterly Wall Street Journal survey of housing data in 28 major metro areas shows that the glut of unsold homes listed for sale is shrinking in most of them. In many cases, sales have been stimulated by investors who are grabbing what they see as bargains on homes that can be turned into rentals. Metro areas with the biggest drops in for-sale signs include Sacramento and Orange County in California and the Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent headlines give a mixed picture. On Monday, the Census Bureau reported that new home sales in September were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 464,000 units, down 33% from September 2007. The median sales price for new homes in September was $218,400, down 9% from a year earlier. Last week, the National Association of Realtors said sales of previously occupied homes in September edged up 1.4% from the depressed year-earlier level, the first such rise since November 2005, largely reflecting sales of foreclosed homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing analysts caution that many homes that aren't currently listed for sale may hit the market in the next year or two. This looming supply includes pending foreclosures and homes temporarily taken off the market while their owners await stronger demand. With banks chopping prices on foreclosed homes, other sellers "are giving up and taking their homes off of the market," says Michael Lyon, president of Trendgraphix Inc., a research firm in Sacramento.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, credit remains tight, consumer confidence is crumbling, and job losses are removing some potential buyers from the market while pushing others toward foreclosure. "Now we're adding a second leg down [in housing], which is the job losses," says Kenneth Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates jumped Monday amid continued turmoil in the credit markets. Some mortgage firms quoted rates of 6.5% or more for standard 30-year fixed-rate loans. That was up from an average of 6.2% last week, according to HSH Associates, a financial publisher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite all the gloom, some people believe it isn't too early to pick up bargains. One key, they say, is a deep understanding of the local demand for rental housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dinesh and Rima Kumar, who live in Ashburn, Va., last month bought a town house in Sterling, Va., a suburb of Washington, D.C., for $154,000. The same home sold in June 2005 for $375,000 to a buyer who used subprime loans to finance 100% of the price. It went into foreclosure late last year. Mr. Kumar says he has found a renter at $1,500 a month. The Kumars, who paid cash for the home, calculate their monthly expenses -- including taxes, insurance, maintenance and fees -- at $491 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple made the plunge partly because Ms. Kumar, a real-estate agent for Realty Direct, noticed that homes in the area priced at $250,000 or less were attracting multiple offers. Home sales in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington totaled 3,360 in September, up 92% from a year earlier, according to the Northern Virginia Association of Realtors. The average price: about $333,000, down 32% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This could be the bottom," Mr. Kumar says, and even if it isn't, "the down side on a $150,000 property is pretty low." Moreover, he has been burned in the past by stock-market investments and thinks rental income will far exceed the meager interest rates offered on bank deposits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real Property Investment Group LLC of Atlanta recently bought a three-bedroom house in Snellville, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta, for $50,000. The home had sold in March 2007 for $116,900 and went into foreclosure a year later. The latest sale price is only modestly above the $45,800 price the home fetched when it was newly built in 1981, according to RealQuest.com, a data service of First American CoreLogic Inc. Charlie Chico, managing partner of Real Property Investment, estimates that the home can be rented out for $900 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Chico notes that foreclosed homes aren't necessarily bargains. "You have to be picky," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though housing demand increases over the long run with population, it may be tepid in the next year or two. In hard times, notes Jay Brinkmann, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, many young people move in with parents or find roommates, reducing the rate at which new households are formed. Mr. Brinkmann also expects a further rise in foreclosures over the next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> estimates that banks and loan investors owned 826,200 foreclosed homes as of Sept. 1, up from 343,500 a year earlier. <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> forecasts that this inventory will peak at around 1.3 million homes in mid-2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ivy Zelman, chief executive of housing-research firm Zelman &amp;Associates, says far more vacant homes are being held off the market than usual. In the second quarter, vacant homes that weren't listed for sale totaled about 6.5 million, she estimates, using Census Bureau data. That's about one million more than the typical level during the first half of this decade. If a million of those vacant homes were listed for sale, listings would rise about 23% from the current level. Some of these empty homes are in the foreclosure process, Ms. Zelman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on the S&amp;P Case-Shiller national home-price index, prices on average already were down about 18% in this year's second quarter from the peak two years before. Celia Chen, director of housing economics at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com, expects a further drop of about 14% before prices bottom out in the second half of 2009. Prices won't bottom out everywhere at the same time, of course. Ms. Chen expects Florida's recovery to lag behind that of the nation as a whole, partly because a backlog of foreclosures in courts there will take time to clear. In the Miami area, nearly 18% of home mortgages are overdue or in foreclosure, compared with a national average of 7%, according to Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The glut of homes in South Florida is concentrated on the lower end of the market, says Ron Shuffield, president of Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell Inc., a big real-estate brokerage there.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing Needs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Sales</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Find Bottom</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is giving new meaning to the phrase "beggar thy neighbor."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department Monday reports September new-home sales. Economists estimate they slowed to an annualized pace of 455,000 units from 460,000 in August. Three years ago the pace was at about 1.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday brought news of a surprising gain in home resales in September. But up to 40% of home resales these days are foreclosures or "short sales," in which the mortgage balance is higher than the home's value, according to the National Association of Realtors. Such sales drag down the prices of other homes and pull more mortgage-holders underwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This phenomenon has led to an oddly bifurcated housing market, in which existing-home sales have built a bottom, while new-home sales haven't stopped drilling their way to the center of the earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"New homes have never decoupled from existing homes" before, as "most people that buy a new home have to sell an existing home first," says Ivy Zelman, CEO of Zelman &amp;Associates Housing Research. She expects new-home sales of just 410,000 next year, the worst pace in a quarter-century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This decoupling may be because many of the people buying foreclosed homes -- maybe 50% in some markets -- are investors. Some will rent the houses until the market recovers, further hurting demand for home purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until new-home sales find their own bottom, housing won't begin to heal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How Low Can Prices</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York Go?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buzz in the commercial-property world is whether things will get as bad as they were in the real-estate "depression" of the early 1990s. A new report coming out Monday from Portfolio &amp;Property Research suggests they might.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Portfolio &amp;Property Research is expected to release a revised forecast Monday that shows 17.6% of New York metro area offices will be empty by the middle of next year. That's the same level as in 1991, when New York tycoons were going broke in a New York minute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's troubling news for already battered New York-area office landlord <span class="companylink">SL Green Realty</span>, which reports results Monday. Analysts are expecting funds from operations -- a common REIT measure -- to come in at $1.41 a share, compared with $1.25 a year ago, according to SNL Financial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SL Green is also a big lender to other landlords, both from its own balance sheet and through its ailing spinoff, <span class="companylink">Gramercy Capital Corp</span>., in which SL Green has a 22% stake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are looking for clarity on the roughly $840 million in loans SL Green made from its balance sheet, as many are mezzanine positions in undisclosed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company says it plans to provide more detail on a Tuesday conference call and discounts the vacancy forecast, pointing out that SL Green's portfolio is mostly in Manhattan, where vacancies are lower -- and rents are higher -- than the regional average.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>629 words</div><div>25 October 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously occupied homes rose 1.4% from a year earlier in September as banks slashed prices on foreclosed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase, marking the first time since November 2005 that sales topped year-earlier levels, shows that bargain hunters are nibbling at a glut of homes. But that glut remains huge, and credit is still tight. New data from government-backed mortgage investor <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> showed that rising borrowing costs have constrained its ability to push down interest rates by channeling more money into the mortgage market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, growing job losses are likely to lead to more foreclosures and lower housing demand. As a result, many housing analysts say they don't expect home prices to bottom out for at least another year. "There's really no sign of a housing recovery," said Kenneth Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes, condominiums, town homes and cooperative apartments reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.18 million units in September, up from 5.11 million a year earlier, the National Association of Realtors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price in September was $191,600, down 9% from a year earlier and 15% below the peak three years ago. The Realtors' group estimated that foreclosure-related sales accounted for 35% to 40% of transactions last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks trying to unload foreclosed homes "lower the price 5% every month," said Ivy Zelman, chief executive of Zelman &amp;Associates, a housing-research firm. "They have to get rid of them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That makes it hard for ordinary homeowners and builders to sell without slashing prices. "New-home sales were horrible in September, and October is looking even worse," Ms. Zelman said. The Census Bureau is scheduled to report September new-home sales Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of previously occupied homes listed for sale at the end of September was 4.27 million, down 1.6% from a month earlier, the Realtors' group said. That was smaller than the average decline of 3% in September over the past 25 years, according to Ms. Zelman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many, but not all, foreclosed homes are included in that listings total. <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> estimates that banks and loan investors owned 826,200 foreclosed homes as of Sept. 1, up from 343,500 a year earlier. The firm forecasts that this inventory will peak at around 1.3 million homes in 21 months before starting to decline. Foreclosure-related sales are particularly heavy in California, Florida, Nevada and Arizona.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said Friday that its commitments to buy mortgages in September totaled $2.5 billion, down from an average of $18.5 billion monthly in the year's first eight months. Federal regulators took management control of Freddie and its main rival, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, in early September and have been prodding them to increase their purchases of mortgages as a way to hold down or reduce rates charged to consumers. But the companies' costs of borrowing have risen as foreign investors shy away from buying their bonds and notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on mortgage securities guaranteed by the companies is slightly less than the interest they would likely need to offer if they were to raise money by selling five- or 10-year bonds, said Priya Misra, a mortgage analyst at <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>. Until their borrowing costs fall, "they may not be able to grow a lot."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Fannie and Freddie remain constrained by their borrowing costs, the U.S. Treasury may feel the need to step up its own purchases of mortgage securities, said Mahesh Swaminathan, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Simply laughable. Ugly exterior and priced with copious amounts of grandiosity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is what happens when you are filthy rich. No one tells you, you have bad taste."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Selling your home could be bad for your ego. The above quotes are recent comments on real-estate blogs -- online journals that often post photos of new sales listings and allow readers to add their thoughts anonymously. Thanks to the housing crisis, real-estate blogs are blooming not only in number, but in nastiness, as thousands of strangers swap stinging critiques of high-end homes hitting the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And bloggers say the pricier the house, the juicier the target. On SocketSite.com, a recent posting about a 7,000-square-foot home with four adjoining units listed at $16.95 million attracted about a dozen comments, including the suggestion that the home "be bought by Transylvania for use as their embassy." An $11.5 million listing on the blog Real Estate Stalker inspired this alliteration: "Everything inside is nothing but beige and barf!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The current real-estate market has brought out the worst in people," says David Gibbons, director of community relations for Seattle-based Zillow.com, a real-estate site where people can comment on discussion boards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, posters grew so "aggressively rude" at Brooklyn blog Brownstoner.com that founder Jonathan Butler began requiring every user to register with the site before they could post. "It got to the point where I couldn't leave my desk for half an hour," says Mr. Butler, who deletes inappropriate posts on his site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge in verbal abuse doesn't seem to be damaging the housing-blog business. Curbed.com, which has sites for New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, has seen its unique-visitor numbers climb to a million a month from 400,000 a month last year. Traffic has doubled on Brownstoner.com in the past year and spiked 11% in the first two weeks of October, compared to the month prior. At SocketSite.com comments are up about 25% over the past three months alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real-estate veterans chalk up the anger to frustrated would-be buyers living in cities where home prices are still out of reach. "Blogs are a great forum to vent that anger," says Will Rogers, an agent with New York-based Fenwick Keats Goodstein, whose client's brownstone, listed at $2.99 million, was recently slammed on a blog for its resemblance to an "average rental apartment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The phenomenon is also helped by the growing popularity of posting multiple photos of a new listing online, which allow would-be critics to tour properties from the comfort of their computers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The skewering of fancy properties can be wicked fun -- unless you're the owner. One day this month, neuroradiologist Luis Fernandez was taken aback to see his four-story, 4,100-square-foot Brooklyn home, listed for sale at $2.5 million, on Brownstoner.com. The blog razzed Dr. Fernandez's home, calling it "McMansion chic" and predicting price reductions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Readers quickly chimed in, citing overuse of track lighting and black granite and calling the border on the bathtub "hideous" and the furniture "cheesy." "They're probably hipsters -- people who live really grungy," counters Dr. Fernandez, noting that the bathroom tiles are handmade and the "cheesy" furniture cost over $100,000. "I didn't really want to buy it -- that was my wife -- but that's another subject," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Fernandez also notes that a smaller house in the neighborhood recently sold for more and scoffs at the notion that he ruined the character with his renovations. Still, he says his five-year-old son was thrilled to see it on the computer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Francisco, Andrew Lochart had never heard of SocketSite.com until he was told by his agent that his newly listed three-bedroom, mid-century-modern home had debuted on the site this month. When he read the comments, Mr. Lochart says he was tempted to shoot back at his critics and post "Let's see photos of your house." He didn't, and the house, with an asking price of $1.1 million, subsequently had three offers and sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some owners are fighting back. When commenters attacked his Manhattan Beach, Calif. house, Peter Bohlinger began defending the home with his own anonymous posts. But after a few weeks, Mr. Bohlinger, a real-estate investor, gave up. "I have just stopped reading it because it was making me so mad," he says. His house still hasn't sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some agents are also going on the offensive. Northwest Multiple Listings Service recently won a case against Redfin.com to stop the online company from letting people search and comment on its listings. But most agents acknowledge they have no way to control what people say. "It's damaging. It's negative and destructive, mean-spirited and pointless," says Judith Lief, an agent with Warren Lewis Realty Associates in New York. "What can I do?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Web sites say any misinformation can be easily corrected. And while agents worry about negative posts from rivals, sites say agents rarely comment in disguise to talk a property down. Instead, agents usually try to shill their own listings. "Agents come on and try to list 20 different comments under 20 different names, all saying positive things," says Adam Koval, SocketSite.com's editor in chief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least one seller figured out how to tame the mob. On Sept. 30, Skei Saulnier learned from friends that her 1,020-square-foot Brooklyn duplex, on the market for $849,000, had popped up on Brownstoner.com. She logged on and learned that her condo's kitchen is "functionally obsolescent" and her bedrooms are too small.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the 31-year-old stay-at-home mom began posting herself, identifying herself as the owner and replying directly to each criticism. "I just cooked dinner for my family in my 'functionally obsolescent' kitchen," she wrote. "It's one of my favorite rooms in the house and whenever we have company we spend most of our time in the eat-in kitchen."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reaction: lots of praise. "Brave to come here and post. I commend you," was a typical response. The comments became much nicer after that. Ms. Saulnier says she then invited her commenters to come to the open house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when the day arrived, none of the blog commenters identified themselves, if they came at all. Ms. Saulnier thinks they were too embarrassed. The duplex is now under contract.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Martin is asking $28,000 a week to rent out his villa on the Caribbean island of St. Barthelemy. The actor bought the house, which had been listed for $9 million, this past spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the hills of Lurin, the house (pictured below) has four bedrooms and four full bathrooms, with a large deck and wide views of St. Jean Bay. Renovated in 2003, the home has a mixture of American and local furnishings. The half-acre property comes with a caretaker's house, a pool, a lily pond and a Balinese-style gazebo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">French-speaking St. Barts, in the Lesser Antilles about 120 miles north of Guadeloupe's main islands, is just 11 miles long and 2.5 miles wide. Renting out vacant homes is common practice there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Martin, 63 years old, rented the four-bedroom home last winter and purchased it this past spring "turnkey," including furnishings. The sale price wasn't disclosed. Mr. Martin has changed little in the house, says his rental agent, Tom Smyth, of St. Barth Properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year in St. Barts, a hillside mansion on two acres sold for €25 million, about $39 million at the time, a record for a private residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hilary Swank to Buy Condo in New York</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York City, Oscar-winning actress Hilary Swank is in contract to pay $3.5 million for a two-bedroom apartment at the Superior Ink condominium building, a West Village development that's still under construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designed by architect Robert A.M. Stern, the new 17-story development, built on the site of a former factory along Hudson River Park, will have 68 apartments and seven townhouses. There will be a 24-hour concierge, valet parking, a gym and a screening room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment units are 95% sold at an average of more than $3,000 per square foot, says David Wine, vice chairman of Related Cos., the developer. Mr. Wine didn't comment on Ms. Swank's purchase. Completion is slated for spring 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Swank, 34 years old, won two Best Actress Academy Awards for "Boys Don't Cry" (1999) and "Million Dollar Baby" (2004); next year, she's scheduled to appear in a film about aviatrix Amelia Earhart. In 2007, Ms. Swank and her ex-husband, actor Chad Lowe, sold their West Village townhouse for $7.05 million, according to records. Later that year, she paid $5.8 million for a house in Los Angeles's Pacific Palisades neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A publicist for Ms. Swank didn't return a call seeking comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tour-Operator CEO Lists Bel-Air Estate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Noel Irwin-Hentschel, chief executive of American Tours International, has listed her Normandy-style mansion in the Los Angeles community of Bel-Air for $18 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three-story, 10,000-square-foot house, on 0.9 acre, was built in 1934. It has eight bedrooms, 10 bathrooms and French-style formal gardens. There's a pool and caretaker's quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Irwin-Hentschel and her husband, resort developer Gordon Hentschel, renovated extensively, adding his-and-hers master bathrooms among other things. The couple paid $3.75 million for the house in 1995, records show. Neighbors include Hilton CEO Christopher Nassetta and actor Nicolas Cage, whose mansion is on the market for just under $30 million. Joyce Rey, of Coldwell Banker Previews International and Bridget Martens, of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, have the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Irwin-Hentschel's company is one of the largest tour operators in the country. A Republican, she ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor of California in 1998.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and her husband also own Stonepine, a 330-acre resort in Northern California's Carmel Valley, where they live in a chateau on the property.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Shara Tibken </div><div>351 words</div><div>23 October 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; B10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Pulte Homes Inc</span>.'s third-quarter net loss narrowed thanks to lower write-downs, but the homebuilder warned that buyer confidence continues to be pressured by uncertainty and volatility in the markets, as well as higher unemployment and a weaker economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The homebuilding operating environment significantly worsened during the third quarter of 2008," said Chief Executive Richard J. Dugas Jr. "The industry continues to be plagued by tighter mortgage availability, a growing number of foreclosures and a historically high supply of unsold homes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, one of the nation's largest home builders, reported a net loss of $280.4 million, or $1.11 a share, compared with a year-ago loss of $787.9 million, or $3.12 a share. The latest results included $266.6 million of impairments and other land-related charges, while year-ago results included $842 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue dropped 37% to $1.56 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net new-home orders in the quarter fell 34% to 3,008 homes. Closings dropped 28% to 5,377 as the average sales price declined 13% to $281,000. The backlog as of Sept. 30, was valued at $1.7 billion, or 5,885 homes, down from $4.1 billion, or 12,042 homes, a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulte, which builds active-adult communities as well as traditional homes, ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said it's not providing fourth-quarter guidance due to the "high degree of uncertainty and volatility" in the housing industry and overall economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homebuilders have struggled as first-time home buyers find it difficult to come up with down payments, and foreclosure sales put pressure on home and land values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the Commerce Department reported construction of new dwellings dropped 6.3% last month to the slowest pace since January 1991 — a period when the U.S. was in a recession and going through a similar housing correction. Construction declined 8.1% in August and 12.9% in July.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction industry, already hit hard by the housing downturn, is bracing for serious reductions in commercial and public-works projects that could lead to the industry's deepest and longest contraction in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a closely watched report scheduled to be released Thursday, McGraw-Hill Construction estimates the value of new construction projects will fall to $515 billion next year, down 7% from this year and off 25% from its peak of $690 billion in 2006. The decline will be led by cutbacks in the construction of hotels, office buildings, warehouses and factories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, as single-family housing slipped into a gulch, the building of hospitals, roads, schools and offices had remained relatively strong. But now states are suffering lower tax revenue, and financing for commercial projects has become prohibitively expensive or impossible to secure as banks pull back lending. For example, educational buildings will see a 3% decline to $55 billion, the <span class="companylink">McGraw-Hill</span> report says. Health-care construction spending will see a similar percentage decline, to $26 billion. Highways and bridges will see a 4% decline to $50 billion in new projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It all adds up to the biggest sustained decline in construction in at least four decades. The length of the decline is also breaking records. Most construction downturns last one or two years. But according to <span class="companylink">McGraw-Hill</span>, the construction downturn will endure its third year among all property types. It will be the fourth year of decline for construction of single-family homes. The last time that happened was 1979 to 1982.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's the most difficult environment for construction since the early 1990s," says Robert Murray, vice president for economic affairs at McGraw-Hill Construction, a unit of New York-based <span class="companylink">McGraw-Hill Cos</span>. "The big story for 2009 will be how the weakening construction market will spread to nonresidential building and public works," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nobody can get a loan if you are a developer, and if you are a state or local government, you may not be able to float a bond," says Kenneth Simonson, chief economist for Associated General Contractors, a trade group. He says developers and governments are canceling or halting projects across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">McGraw-Hill</span> forecast is based on the company's tracking of new-construction projects, including the issuance of building permits by local governments. The data, know as construction starts, are an indicator of future construction spending and often correlate strongly with actual construction spending, which is tracked monthly by the Census Bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonresidential construction will drop 10% next year to about $220 billion. In square-footage terms, the country will build 12% less nonresidential space -- including stores, offices and warehouses -- than in 2008.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Maintaining Credit Line Is Key for Gramercy</span>
</div><div>526 words</div><div>22 October 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; C12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When <span class="companylink">Gramercy Capital Corp</span>. releases its third-quarter earnings, investors in the commercial property finance and investment company likely will focus on its ability to maintain credit lines from its bank lenders. A failure to do so could put the New York company's survival in doubt and put a drag on its largest shareholder and corporate cousin -- office developer and investor <span class="companylink">SL Green Realty Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gramercy hasn't announced a date for its earnings release, but it is expected as soon as next week. Like many of its peers, the real-estate investment trust has seen its access to capital curtailed by the credit crunch. It also is suffering from a scarcity of property transactions and rising defaults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is flirting with breaching certain covenants on its unsecured bank lines. For instance, the $175 million line from KeyBank requires, among other things, that Gramercy's earnings be at least 1.30 times what it has to make in interest payments. Last quarter, that ratio fell to 1.42.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A violation of that covenant could lead KeyBank to ask for immediate repayment. As of June 30, Gramercy had tapped $75 million on that facility. It reported $55 million in cash on its balance sheet. A spokesman for the company declined to comment ahead of its earnings release. Shares in Gramercy are down about 95% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spacing Out</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is something office landlords hate to see: tenants competing with landlords by subleasing unused space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That increasingly is the situation across the country, according to an analysis by brokers <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. Through the third quarter, shrinking companies have put 13% more space for sublease since the downturn began in the second quarter of 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are in the early innings of this," says Greg O'Brien, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>'s brokerage division. He says more companies will sublease space next year, but he doesn't think it will get as bad as the last downturn in the beginning of the decade when technology companies locked up acres of offices in anticipation of growth that never arrived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worst-hit markets -- no surprise -- are also the ones that have been sideswiped by the housing market downturn. West Palm Beach, Fla., saw a 293% increase in sublease space. Phoenix also was hard hit, up 121%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tap-Dance Deals</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial real-estate market may still be far from a bottom, but one company sees a way to profit as properties decline in value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen J. Furnary, CEO of the real-estate investment firm ING Clarion Partners LLC, in New York, says his company is looking to help refinance expiring loans on properties whose values may have fallen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Furnary, whose firm manages $150 billion in assets, described a potential deal in which ING Clarion would lend a distressed borrower a first mortgage on a property, resell that mortgage to others in tranches, and keep a high-yielding mezzanine loan position. "With that tap dance, we think we can get a 22% return on the mezz piece," he says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jonathan Karp </div><div>1278 words</div><div>22 October 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; C1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indefatigable billionaire Jorge Pérez is angling to profit in part from the condominium woes of indefatigable billionaire Jorge Pérez.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pérez is chairman and chief executive of Related Group, the biggest condo developer in south Florida, and perhaps the greatest optimist in brazenly overbuilt Miami. Having borrowed more than $1 billion to erect soaring towers in downtown Miami, he is scrambling to sell thousands of condos amid the deepest market swoon in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the 59-year-old entrepreneur -- a fast talker whose marketing flair evokes comparisons to Donald Trump -- also has emerged as one of the most aggressive buyers of condos on the cheap, starting with units in one of his own buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An investment fund formed by Related and Philadelphia private-equity firm Lubert-Adler Partners LP recently snapped up $100 million of Florida condos in five projects. More than one-third of that money has gone into 50 Biscayne, a stylish Miami building that Related developed with a different partner. The plan is to rent the units until they can be sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pérez has plenty more condos to market. Within blocks of each other on Miami's prestigious Brickell Avenue, Related this year has opened two projects totaling some 1,600 condos. Its landmark three-tower, 1,800-unit complex, Icon Brickell, is soon to start taking residents. Mr. Pérez has other large projects in the works outside of Miami, and the rate at which buyers are walking away from deposits is higher than expected. "I may end up having to hold 1,000 units," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pérez's gambit is both to protect his investments and position himself for an eventual resurgence in Miami's property market. There are risks because it isn't clear how long it will take Miami prices, down some 30% from their peak, to bottom out and recover. And, it is potentially rife with conflicts of interest in deals where Mr. Pérez sits on both sides of the negotiating table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pérez shrugs off any suggestion of a conflict, saying his roles are fully disclosed. And he says a big reason why he is buying his own condos is that he likes them. "I don't think there is any better investment than the properties I know best," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dean Adler, chief executive of Lubert-Adler, also doesn't see a conflict, but notes that the purchase of Related condos was the exception, not the rule. "That is not the intention of the partnership," he says. "Every deal that we're looking at now is unrelated to Related."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When closely held Related and Lubert-Adler unveiled in February a fund to buy $1 billion of distressed property, they said that the venture was "created to purchase mortgages and property solely from other developers, lenders and property owners." By last spring, Mr. Pérez was hedging, saying that the fund's primary goal wasn't to buy Related-developed condos, though he didn't rule it out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate experts and rival developers are watching to see if Mr. Pérez will be savvy enough to emerge whole from a challenging predicament. "Miami is so flooded with product that even at 50 cents on the dollar, most of it doesn't work as rental," says Lewis Goodkin, a Miami consultant who represents investors and developers. "If anybody can do it, Jorge can."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Born in Argentina to Cuban parents, Mr. Pérez studied urban planning in the U.S. and is widely credited with helping to invigorate Miami neighborhoods by developing multifamily housing for low-income families. In 1979, he and Stephen Ross, chairman and chief executive of New York's Related Cos., co-founded Related Group of Florida, when both developers focused on low-income housing. The two men have shifted to high-end projects and separated their companies. Mr. Ross still owns about 20% of the Florida firm, Mr. Pérez says, and Mr. Pérez holds stakes in various projects led by Mr. Ross.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While he has ventured nationally, not always with success, Mr. Pérez dominates his home turf of Miami where he pioneered downtown condos and built a strong sales force with a deep and loyal customer base in Latin America and Europe. Even as he acknowledges contributing to overbuilding, Mr. Pérez exudes confidence and he sees his properties as key to making Miami a world-class city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, he's doubling down with the help of outside investors. The first purchases by the Related-Lubert-Adler fund were at 50 Biscayne, a 54-story, 528-unit downtown Miami condo tower that Related co-developed with <span class="companylink">Cousins Properties Inc</span>. A company called 50 Biscayne Suites LLC bought 20 units there for $6.1 million in May, and months later, Mr. Pérez confirmed that Related and Lubert-Adler were the buyers under the Biscayne Suites name. In August, Cousins announced that it and Related had sold the final 120 residential condos in the building to the Related-Lubert-Adler fund for $30.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Zalewski, principal of Miami-area consulting company Condo Vultures LLC, says the fund picked up the 144 units at a combined rate of $246 a square foot, well below previous sales prices. Lucas Lechuga, a <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> broker who runs a Web site that analyzes the Miami condo market, calls the deal a "bargain for Jorge." That is, Mr. Pérez as the buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matt Gove, senior vice president at Cousins, declined to discuss pricing beyond saying that the Atlanta real-estate investment trust has earned a pretax profit, before minority interest, of about $18 million on the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Cousins felt like the partnership received a fair price," Mr. Gove says. "Especially given the market, we think 50 Biscayne was a success." Mr. Adler says the price was fair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Related-Lubert-Adler fund deals include a $30 million purchase of 239 condos in Broward County and most of the condos in a 117-unit Fort Lauderdale building that is in bankruptcy-court proceedings. Mr. Pérez says he is close to sealing five more purchases, including condos in a Brickell Avenue building. "Not one of mine," he says. The fund has financed each deal with about 65% debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every project we're buying is at a discount to replacement cost," Mr. Pérez says. The discount for 50 Biscayne was lower than the others, he notes. "It's my product. It's also the best product there is."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He maintains that his purchases don't have to be limited to the Lubert-Adler partnership. He believes Related is nimble enough to avoid the busts that ruined pioneering developers in Miami Beach and Coral Gables. This year, he expects Related to turn a $200 million profit on $2 billion in sales. Next year won't be as good, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it will feature the debut of his massive legacy project, Icon Brickell, which features Philippe Starck design flourishes, a two-acre terrace and a 300-foot-long pool. He says his team is "working like crazy, calling every buyer" to close sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pérez, meanwhile, will stay in the hunt for bargain buys. "There is no question in my mind that within some time -- I don't know if that's two, three or four years -- people are going to look back and say: 'These units were bought for how little!'" he says emphatically. "Some of these are really a gimme. And we think the future of Miami is very strong."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS BANOS, Calif. -- In this California city, one of the hardest hit in the national housing crash, there's good news: Homes are starting to sell again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors and first-time home buyers are snapping up foreclosed houses here, with the number of local sales up almost fivefold from this time last year. While the volume of existing-home sales across the U.S. fell 10.7% in August from the previous year, according to the National Association of Realtors, there are signs that the most damaged of markets are starting to heal themselves. Across hard-hit California, sales volumes rose 65% in September compared with a year ago, said MDA <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>, a San Diego-based real-estate information service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bad news is that the latest round of sales is unleashing another round of pain in cities such as Los Banos, a commuter community in California's Central Valley. With home prices already down 66% from their peak here, most homeowners owe more on their mortgages than their houses are worth. Successive deals bring new low prices, leaving remaining owners with little incentive to keep current on outsized mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some stop paying, pocketing the money while they wait for their lenders to kick them out. A few lose their homes only to stay on as renters, paying hundreds of dollars less a month. Every fifth house in this onetime real-estate boomtown is in some state of the foreclosure process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until markets like this are sorted out, there's little hope for calm in the global financial system. As banks and governments survey the wreckage of residential real-estate investments, the central mystery is how to value the trillions of dollars in securities that are tied to U.S. mortgages. These securities are so hard to value in part because no one knows when normalcy will return to places like Los Banos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists and politicians offer two main prescriptions. Many say the government should buy these homeowners' expensive mortgages and reduce the loan amounts to reflect current values, a taxpayer-funded effort to put a floor under the housing market. Others say such intervention would reward those who bought homes they couldn't afford, and prolong the inevitable pain of a necessary housing contraction. These people say the market should continue its own path toward equilibrium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither option would be pretty, judging by homeowners' experience here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Banos, a city of about 36,000 people, lies in Merced County near the center of the Central Valley, a fertile expanse that has long drawn opportunity seekers -- Basque sheep farmers, dairy farmers from Portugal, migrants fleeing the Dust Bowl states during the Great Depression. Many of their descendants live here still.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This decade, Los Banos drew commuters from Silicon Valley, 80 miles to the northwest, and the construction workers who built their houses. Its housing market took off as builders, lenders and the government helped more people realize the dream of homeownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dairy farms and fields of tomatoes gave way to cookie-cutter houses on the likes of Bentley Drive, Chianti Court and Riesling Street. Subprime lenders poured in, making cheap loans with few questions asked. Builders offered to pick up the tab for their customers' closing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices soared. In 2005, one local builder was selling three-bedroom homes for $300,000 -- more than three times what it asked for a similar design in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many lenders catered to buyers with shoddy credit, who qualified for "affordability" loans with low payments that typically ramped up over time. In 2006, 45% of the home mortgages and refinance loans in Los Banos were high-rate loans, most of which would be considered subprime, compared with a national average of 29%, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of federal mortgage data. The town's top lenders included <span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial</span>, <span class="companylink">New Century Financial</span> and divisions of <span class="companylink">Golden West Financial</span> and <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span> -- all former highfliers in the mortgage business whose holdings later turned toxic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sister Next Door</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Claudia Pedroza and Veronica Banuelos were among the home buyers. In 2006, the sisters and their husbands bought new houses next door to each other in a subdivision surrounded by fields just outside Los Banos. Ms. Banuelos paid $350,000 and Ms. Pedroza paid $375,000 for similar four-bedroom homes with three bathrooms and cavernous living rooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property records indicate that the Pedroza and Banuelos families took out loans for nearly 100% of the price from <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. In the Pedrozas' case, the bank worked with the national nonprofit Acorn Housing Corp. as part of a program to help first time home buyers. The home builder, <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>., funded $12,000 or more in closing costs for each home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A California state housing agency also chipped in a $11,200 loan toward the Pedrozas' purchase. Ms. Pedroza figured that with her husband bringing home $3,200 a month as a house painter, the family could afford the monthly mortgage payment of about $2,000. Ms. Banuelos, a college student, said the payments were affordable for her husband, who also had ample work as a house painter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the housing boom brought jobs to many local residents and attracted new businesses, with <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> and Target going up on the same street as a slaughterhouse and the local office of the Hay Growers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the market turned in 2007, and now the Merced metropolitan area leads the U.S. in many indexes of misery. By the third quarter of this year, 12.3% of home loans were delinquent in Merced County, the highest in the nation, according to Equifax and <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. Merced has also seen some of the country's sharpest home-price declines. It has the highest share of owners who owe more on their houses than they're currently worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Pedroza lost her home to foreclosure when her husband's painting jobs vanished and the couple fell six months behind on their payments. The Pedrozas are now paying $750 a month to rent a two-bedroom apartment in downtown Los Banos, where their 10-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son share a room. Ms. Banuelos's husband also took a cut in house-painting hours, and the couple stopped paying their mortgage four months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, on the block where Ms. Pedroza and Ms. Banuelos bought homes, five of the 16 houses are empty with brown lawns, a typical sign of a foreclosed property. Both sisters are hoping that <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> will renegotiate their loan terms to allow them to become homeowners in good standing once again. "I've told the bank, 'You won't be giving me anything for free,'" Ms. Pedroza says. "Just make it so I can afford the payment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Acorn official encouraged the Pedrozas, who have already lost their house, to call the group for help. A <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> spokesman said the bank's servicing team would "reach out" to the Banuelos family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such dramas are repeated throughout California, where the U.S. housing market is arguably at its most troubled. Following years of big profits for bankers and home builders in this state, one-fifth of all outstanding U.S. mortgages by dollar value -- and a higher percentage of risky loans -- are written on homes here. Of the 25 metropolitan areas with the largest home-price declines in the past 12 months, 16 are in the state, according to Zillow.com, a real-estate research Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those woes weigh on the financial system. Though California represents about 12% of the nation's population, its homes account for 34% of the loans in a typical mortgage-backed security, according to Fitch Ratings. "California doesn't have a Wall Street problem. Wall Street has a California problem," says Christopher Thornberg, principal at Los-Angeles based Beacon Economics and member of the California Controller's Council of Economic Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People here talk a lot, and agree little, about what should be done to fix things. On a recent day in the Verona subdivision, an upscale development riddled with for-sale signs, Bill Knoff laid out pizza and beer for a half a dozen members of his van pool. The co-commuters, who drive nearly 80 miles from Los Banos to Silicon Valley each morning and then back each night, sparred over who's to blame for local foreclosures and whether the government should bail out mortgage holders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Knoff's house has traveled the arc of the local market. Built on vacant land in 2002, it sold for $280,000. Its original owner unsuccessfully tried to sell it in 2006 for $450,000. Mr. Knoff bought it out of foreclosure in March of this year for $320,000. Today, based on local sales, he figures the house is worth about $220,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Knoff paid nearly half of the purchase price in cash, so most of his equity has been wiped out. But he said he believes in taking responsibility for such choices. "The government can buy up troubled mortgages. But it should kick the people out of their houses," said the 61-year-old information technology manager. "Why should I pay for someone to buy their house?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Darryl Williams blamed mortgage companies for granting the easy loans that fueled the boom. "I don't like hearing that the people who got houses and couldn't afford them are the bad guys," said Mr. Williams, a 55-year-old warehouse-services manager. "These are families with children."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Steve Sherman Sr. spoke. "I am one of those troubled borrowers not making any mortgage payments," Mr. Sherman said. The 61-year-old shipping and warehouse supervisor refinanced his house in Los Banos two years ago for $365,000, spending much of the new loan on home renovations. Now, he figures, the house is worth $140,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sherman said that while he can afford his payments, he had planned to sell the house in a year or so to supplement his retirement income. But now, he figures, he couldn't afford to live there as a retiree. So four months ago he stopped writing mortgage checks, setting the cash aside in his retirement savings. He says he's waiting for his lender to kick him out or to reduce his loan amount. He'd also be happy for the government to modify his loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't deserve a bailout," Mr. Sherman said. "Will I take one? You are darned right I will."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downward Spiral</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such issues are at the heart of a debate among policy makers and economists about how to mend the nation's housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's growing momentum for the government to stem the slide in home prices. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman Sheila Bair said last week the government should do more to help homeowners. Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain has proposed the Treasury spend $300 billion to buy up troubled mortgages and reduce the principal on the loans to reflect current values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others believe government intervention will derail the market mechanisms and postpone the eventual return to equilibrium. Sen. Barack Obama opposes using taxpayer money to intervene in the housing market, advocating instead that the government pressure lenders to alter mortgage terms and change bankruptcy codes to allow judges to do the same. Congress has already passed the Hope for Homeowners program, which aims to put 400,000 borrowers in more affordable loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plus, some economists say the market is already correcting itself without federal intervention. The volume of home sales in California is rising even as the national average continues to fall. At the same time, median prices in the state fell in September, down 34% from the previous year, to $283,000, according to MDA <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The lower prices are getting people to buy, and that's how you equilibrate a market," says Gary Becker, a University of Chicago economics professor who won the 1992 Nobel Prize for research in microeconomics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the bottom still may not be in sight. Home prices in California could end down as much as 60% from peak values, according to recent research from both Barclay's PLC and <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co</span>. Towns like Los Banos may have further to fall. According to the city and a local title office, roughly 2,000 of 10,000 homes in the town are in the foreclosure process. The city expects that number could grow before the crisis passes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Free Meals</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bust is apparent throughout town. Storefronts in its older strip malls are empty. Citywide, sales-tax revenue is down 15% from initial projections and the city is also bracing for big declines in property-tax revenue. The free-meal program at the Los Banos Rescue Mission served 1,110 meals last month, more than triple the levels in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are in survival mode," says Steve Hammond, the pastor of the nearby Bethel Community Church, which runs the mission. Mr. Hammond is also the chairman of the Los Banos Planning Commission. This month, Mr. Hammond missed his own mortgage payment for the first time, after his wife lost her secretarial job. "As Christians we believe in paying our debts," Mr. Hammond said. "But we just can't do it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where many see ruin, some sense opportunity. Michael Arpaia, an officer with the California Highway Patrol, just bought a foreclosed four-bedroom house -- valued at $400,000 two years ago -- for $160,000. He spent $25,000 to replace linoleum floors, carpeting and landscaping. He's renting the house to a local couple who lost their home in foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With stocks falling, Mr. Arpaia is counting on the property's cash flow and appreciation to supplement his retirement nest egg. "My financial adviser says residential real estate is the safest investment right now," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While local homeowners and world markets wait for resolution, Larry Frontella can't believe his fortunes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Frontella grew up on a dairy farm here and worked for three decades as a local deliveryman. In 1993, he bought a new house in the established part of town for $163,000. Two years ago, he refinanced with a $376,000 loan, property records show. His mortgage was written by a unit of <span class="companylink">Golden West Financial</span>, which was later acquired by <span class="companylink">Wachovia Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Frontella paid off credit cards, paid for his wife's funeral and prepaid his own burial. He bought a $17,000 Harley Davidson. "I worked all those years, and felt like I had won the lottery and could take care of everything," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But several months ago, Mr. Frontella fell behind on the $1,800 payment on his interest-only loan. The bank also demanded back payments that pushed his total bill to $2,400 a month. The 68-year-old said he figured he wouldn't live to pay off his home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosure and eviction loomed on Sept. 30. But late last month, a local businessman stepped in and signed a contract to buy the four-bedroom house for $170,000. <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> will take the loss on the value of the original loan, according to people with knowledge of the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer, who declined through his real-estate agent to be interviewed, let Mr. Frontella remain in the home. Mr. Frontella's new monthly rent is $1,100, well below what he paid as an owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking from the driveway of the home he once owned, Mr. Frontella says he feels lucky. "I'm not saying it's not my fault," he said. "Now I'm a renter. What the heck."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Brenda J. Cronin and Jeff Bater </div><div>426 words</div><div>20 October 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>12</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2008, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts and consumer sentiment in the U.S. declined significantly in September, reflecting a national retrenchment protracted by the global credit crunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The preliminary consumer-sentiment index released Friday by Reuters and the University of Michigan skidded to 57.5 in October from 70.3 in September. The index, which began tracking consumer sentiment in the early 1950s, is at its lowest point since June of this year, when rising gasoline prices weighed on consumers. The report said that only four previous surveys had posted declines of 10 or more index points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation expectations in the midmonth survey were mixed. The one-year inflation expectation was 4.5%, from 4.3% in September; the five-year expectation was 2.8%, from 3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumer sentiment is down for the count and isn't going to be getting up anytime soon," said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at Merk Investments. "Even with the decline in the price of gasoline -- falling home prices, the falling value of equity portfolios and bleak job and income prospects should combine to depress consumer sentiment for some time to come."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers will need incentives beyond lower energy prices to resume shopping, particularly for cars and real estate. The consumer sentiment index recorded a surge in the number of people saying now is a bad time to buy a car or house, said Abiel Reinhart, an economist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co</span>. "A considerably larger share of people are saying credit is tight or interest rates are high," Mr. Reinhart said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction slid for the third consecutive month in September, the Commerce Department said Friday, falling 6.3% to a seasonally adjusted 817,000 annual rate, the lowest level in 17 years. Housing starts fell 8.1% in August to 872,000, and July starts plunged 13%. Year over year, housing starts were 31% below the level of construction in September 2007. One silver lining is that the decline in housing starts -- the third steep drop in a row -- should help whittle down existing housing inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits in September fell 8.3% to a 786,000 annual rate. Permits, which have dropped for three straight months, are a gauge of future construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confidence measures among builders underscored the pessimism. A report by the National Association of Home Builders showed industry confidence at an all-time low.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders are working with potential buyers, enrolling them in programs that address everything from credit-report errors to managing debt, in order to raise their credit scores so they can qualify for a mortgage or a better interest rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is another move by a sector desperate to unload inventory as the credit crisis roils the globe, causing lenders to shun borrowers with blemished credit histories and to demand higher credit scores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The programs, conducted over the Internet and in face-to-face meetings, have recently become "a very, very high focus," said Dean Bloxom, president of imortgage.com, a mortgage banker that works with builder <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida-based Debt Resource USA, which uses certified credit counselors and works with builders such as <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">M/I Homes Inc</span>., has seen business triple since it started 18 months ago, said Chief Executive David Vizzi. Hovnanian, an industry trailblazer when it rolled out credit-enhancement programs nationwide last year, has more than 100 enrollees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>., the nation's largest builder by number of annual closings, offers a free credit-improvement program called Home Buyers Club, which assists with credit coaching and analysis and monthly disputes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though no one expects the programs to significantly increase sales -- Hovnanian reports just 51 graduates in the last 18 months -- every sale counts for builders as they see earnings plummet, orders tank and cancellations rise as the worst housing correction in decades shows few signs of letting up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics of the programs say credit reports are available for free, and consumers can challenge errors online. In addition, independent groups with no ties to builders offer complimentary assistance and advice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Greater Atlanta Inc. has developed interactive Web-based podcasts, PowerPoint slides, social networking and journals. The nonprofit group suggests all buyers go through prepurchase counseling and a six-hour buyer's workshop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders make their involvement clear to consumers and say they hope the process will build loyalty and lead to a deal for the builder and its mortgage arm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It becomes a win-win," said Dan Klinger, president of <span class="companylink">K. Hovnanian American Mortgage</span>, which doesn't charge potential buyers to work with Debt Resource USA. "We get to sell one of our homes, and the customer gets to clean up his credit and learn good, fiscal responsibility at the same time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the housing boom, money flowed freely, even to those with weak credit scores, and builders raked in big profits. But as those buyers defaulted, scores of lenders went out of business and foreclosures swelled to record levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders are avoiding risky subprime loans -- which made up 24% of mortgage originations in 2006 -- as well as most of the no-money-down and adjustable-rate mortgages that once inflated sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, builders have been hurt by the loss of seller-funded down-payment assistance, in which third parties contribute to the buyer's down payment via the seller. This summer's housing law banned seller-funded down-payment assistance on mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration as of Oct. 1, essentially ending the practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Qualifying for even a basic 30-year fixed mortgage also has gotten more difficult. Lenders and mortgage insurance companies are scrutinizing credit reports and scores, which detail housing-payment history and length of credit and debt, helping gauge a borrower's risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders said they screen applicants for their credit-repair programs. They avoid those who refuse to pay bills on time and seek those willing to change payment behavior and aspiring buyers hurt by life events such as a divorce, illness or identity theft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone involved is aware there is no way to instantly rebuild a tattered score, though addressing errors is a good start. Depending on what needs to be done, the programs can take weeks or months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The programs address everything from debt to income ratios to why opening a store-branded card at the cash register might not be a good deal. They also teach students about budgeting -- not spending a fortune on furniture for the new house or forgoing that daily latte to build up a safety net should a pipe break or the homeowner get laid off.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Brenda J. Cronin and Jeff Bater </div><div>568 words</div><div>18 October 2008</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>Real Estate; A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2008 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts and consumer sentiment declined significantly in September, reflecting a national retrenchment protracted by the global credit crunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The preliminary consumer sentiment index released Friday by Reuters and the University of Michigan skidded to 57.5 in October from 70.3 in September. The index, which began tracking consumer sentiment in the early 1950s, is at its lowest point since June of this year, when rising gas prices weighed on consumers. The report said only four previous surveys posted declines of 10 index points or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumer sentiment is down for the count and isn't going to be getting up any time soon," said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at Merk Investments. "Even with the decline in the price of gasoline -- falling home prices, the falling value of equity portfolios and bleak job and income prospects should combine to depress consumer sentiment for some time to come."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers will need incentives beyond lower energy prices to resume shopping, particularly for cars and real estate. The consumer sentiment index recorded a surge in the number of people saying now is a bad time to buy a car or house, said Abiel Reinhart, an economist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span>. "A considerably larger share of people are saying credit is tight or interest rates are high," Mr. Reinhart said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction slid for the third consecutive month in September, the Commerce Department said Friday, falling 6.3% to a seasonally adjusted 817,000 annual rate, the lowest level in 17 years. Year-over-year, housing starts were 31% below the level of construction in September 2007. One silver lining is that the decline in housing starts -- the third steep drop in a row -- should help whittle down existing housing inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits in September fell by 8.3% to a 786,000 annual rate. Permits, which have dropped three straight months, are a gauge of future construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confidence measures among builders underscored the pessimism. A report by the National Association of Home Builders showed industry confidence at an all-time low. The group's monthly index, released Thursday, slipped to 14 in October from 17 in September. The gauge is based on a survey of builders asked for their prospects for sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales in the U.S. plunged by 12% in August from July, the Commerce Department reported in late September; the figure was down 35% over the past year. Potential buyers are postponing purchases because the economy is weak and prices keep falling. Because sales are soft, inventories remain high, which, in turn, depresses prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists forecast littleshort-term relief for builders restrained by wary buyers, excess inventory and plunging sales. Signs point to further declines in the fourth quarter and early 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builders are just trying to hang on through this cycle," said Patrick Newport, an economist at Global Insight. "They're actually adjusting very quickly to what's happening," but it could be weeks before they feel any relief -- such as easing mortgage rates and more bank lending -- from government measures to address the global credit crisis. If the measures prove successful and credit resumes moving, Mr. Newport sees the housing market rebounding toward the middle of next year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Against the backdrop of a tough economy, one of the smartest and most affordable ways to start your next trip is to open the doors of your home to a stranger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House swapping, or trading homes with someone else for an agreed-upon period of time (usually at the same time), is gaining more visibility and popularity. There's the economic appeal. (What's not to like about accommodations that are, for all intents and purposes, free?) But such exchanges also appeal to a growing number of travelers who enjoy the comforts of home and want to try their hand at living the way the locals do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To learn more about the advantages -- and possible pitfalls -- in house swaps, we turned to Lois Sealey, who since 1985 has run Home Base Holidays, a membership-based swap service in London. A Canadian by birth, the 62-year-old Ms. Sealey became intrigued with house swaps years ago on a trip to Canada to visit family. At the time, she and her husband and children, as well as her parents, were given the chance to stay in someone else's house -- an "idyllic" lakefront cottage, she recalls -- for free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That experience, Ms. Sealey says, helped convince her that "many people would like to enjoy a home-away-from-home holiday at no cost by swapping" properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We recently caught up with Ms. Sealey in London, via an email exchange. Here are edited excerpts from that electronic conversation:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Easy Now</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Why has house swapping become more popular? What's the appeal?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. SEALEY: There was a major leap in popularity, especially in the U.S., that coincided with the growth of the Internet. Before this time, home exchangers received two or three print directories a year and sent exchange offers by mail -- making arranging an exchange a laborious and time-consuming process. Now, being able to join an agency, have an exchange listing published online instantly, and send exchange offers by email has increased the popularity of home swapping enormously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the methods for arranging exchanges have changed radically in the past 10-plus years, the reasons for wanting to swap homes haven't changed all that much. Home exchange appeals to independent travelers. The most commonly cited reason for taking part is the desire to get away from resorts and other tourists and get to know a real neighborhood and local people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: You note that travelers age 50-plus are a good fit for swaps. Why is that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. SEALEY: Many over-50s are empty nesters, no longer tied to taking time off only during school holidays. Many are also retired or semi-retired, making it easier to be flexible on dates and [the] length of exchange. They are able to consider exchanges at off-peak times when air fares are more reasonable, sometimes arranging both longer swaps and short breaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many in the 50-plus age group still live in family-size homes. What a resource this is to use for swaps in their own countries and abroad. And, as location is usually the most important aspect of home swapping, those who have downsized, perhaps to a small apartment by the sea, will also find no shortage of offers to exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: Can you quantify this trend? How many people are doing it? Is it only for international travel?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. SEALEY: It's difficult to give more than a rough idea of how many people are swapping homes overall. A guesstimate would be 500,000 world-wide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">International exchanges are still the most popular choice. But there have been noticeable changes in the way members have used the service in the last year or two. More are interested in exchanges within their own countries. Also, there seems to be a trend toward having multiple shorter exchanges, including weekend breaks, rather than one lengthy exchange per year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likely Candidates</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: Is there an ideal candidate for something like this?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. SEALEY: Probably the most important characteristics of "ideal" home-exchange candidates are that they are open to new experiences and independent travelers willing to take the time to make their own exchange and travel arrangements. They aren't overly "precious" about their home and belongings, welcoming the opportunities home swapping enables to experience different lifestyles and cultures. Conversely, someone who is overly house proud, wants their vacations completely arranged for them, hates change and would worry the whole time about their own home shouldn't consider home exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: What do you say to people who can't get past the fear of dealing with strangers on a fairly intimate level? After all, you're going to be staying in their homes and they'll be in yours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. SEALEY: It is only through regular correspondence and targeting members who appear most compatible that trust gradually develops on both sides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most people will correspond over several weeks -- even months -- asking as many questions as they want and sometimes exchanging references...with usually a phone call or two during the final preparations when exchange dates are getting close. Some members arrange an overlap in one of the homes -- if there is space to do so -- or meet briefly at the airport. This can be reassuring. But if meeting isn't practical before an exchange, the majority of exchangers will ask a friend who lives nearby, or a willing neighbor, to act as their agent by handing over keys and being available to answer any questions exchange guests may have while in the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: For many people, vacation is about getting away from it all. Can you truly get away from it all if you're living in someone else's home and, say, watering someone else's plants? And what about well-intentioned neighbors stopping by?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. SEALEY: When you are living in an exchange home, it is really no different from renting a house or apartment -- except that you will nearly always have many more facilities and comforts in a "real" home than in a vacation rental property. You don't need to worry about plant care if you really don't want the responsibility. Although many exchangers enjoy the opportunities to meet neighbors and friends of the family, if this would be intrusive, you can make this clear to your exchange partners in advance so they can warn overly friendly neighbors to respect your privacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: How much time does it typically take, from start to finish, to find an acceptable match?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. SEALEY: Much depends on how open you are on destinations you will consider; how flexible you can be on dates and length of exchange, and how popular your location is for exchanges. Experienced exchangers allow plenty of time -- sometimes up to a year or more, depending on the destination -- before the dates they want to exchange. Although some members do arrange exchanges very quickly -- and some have been known to agree to an offer within hours of joining -- it can take a few weeks to find a suitable swap and then get to the point when both parties are ready to agree to go ahead with the exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: What is the average length of time for a vacation swap?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. SEALEY: Swaps vary in length from two days to over a year. The average length for an international exchange is around two to three weeks. But this can vary a lot, depending on individual circumstances and average vacation periods in different countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wrong Ideas</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: What are some of the biggest misconceptions about house swapping?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. SEALEY: That you won't get to know the people you are swapping with; that you need to have a large, luxurious home to take part; that you have to arrange storage for all your clothes and other personal belongings; that no one will be interested in swapping to a remote or little-known location; and that you must swap "like" with "like."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: What causes swaps to fail?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. SEALEY: The vast majority of exchanges work out very well, and we receive few complaints. Those we do receive generally involve misunderstandings rather than negligence or maliciousness. Of these, the most common mismatch involves housekeeping standards. Although all exchangers should leave their homes clean and tidy, accommodations are lived-in homes, not five-star hotels, and standards will vary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: If you open your home, what do you do with valuables, financial records and other personal papers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. SEALEY: As soon as you agree to a home exchange, let your household insurers know that you will be having nonpaying guests in your home and the length of stay. Your home is almost certainly safer being occupied than left empty, but not all policies provide the same level of coverage. Most insurers won't cover you for burglary unless there is evidence of a break-in, so make sure that your exchange partners are aware of all procedures to keep your home secure -- as you will do in their home. If possible, don't leave small, expensive items like jewelry in your home. Check the terms of your insurance policy on accidental damage and agree mutually that the exchange guest will pay for any damages that aren't covered by insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People with enough space in their homes to keep one room locked and out of bounds can store anything there that they would be concerned about, including confidential papers. Others will merely make...clear to their guests anything that they don't want touched.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many home swappers allow use of their computers, but may password protect their own user accounts and set up a separate account for their guests' use. Others may offer broadband access for guests to use with their own laptops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: What are the red flags to watch for?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. SEALEY: During early discussions with potential exchange partners, be wary if they evade answering important questions, don't add photos to their listings -- or at least share some directly with you -- or stop responding to messages without any explanation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avoid exchanging with anyone who appears arrogant, overly fussy or demanding. Home exchange is built on trust, mutual respect and tolerance. This isn't the travel option for prima donnas.</p>
