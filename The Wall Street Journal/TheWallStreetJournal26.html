<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climbing rents for apartments are combining with a continued decline in home prices to push once-reluctant home buyers into finally taking the plunge, economists and real-estate agents said, helping what appears to be a good start to the housing industry's all-important spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although increased buying activity from investors and second-home purchasers are also factors behind the recent pickup in home sales, real-estate agents said they are fielding more calls from anxious tenants complaining about rising rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The rental market has been incredibly hot," said Ronald Peltier, chief executive of HomeServices of America Inc., which owns real-estate brokerages in 21 states. He said rising rents, coupled with slumping home prices and interest rates near record lows, are boosting demand for homes at entry-level prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average apartment rents rose by 2.7% last year while the national vacancy rate dropped below 5% for the first time since 2001, according to a quarterly survey to be released Wednesday by <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment market's broad and sustained growth contrasts sharply with an uneven and tentative housing recovery. During the first quarter, average apartment rents rose and vacancy rates fell in all 82 metropolitan areas tracked by Reis, when compared with a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest rent increases came in San Francisco and San Jose, Calif., which saw increases of 5.9% and 4.9%, respectively. Even boom-to-bust Las Vegas, which has struggled with falling rents in previous quarters, saw average rent rise 1.8% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such increases are one reason why analysts at Zelman &amp; Associates believe 2012 will be the first year since 2005 when the share of apartment renters that moves out to buy a house increases from the previous year. "The equation of renting versus owning is becoming much more favorable for owning," said Ivy Zelman, the firm's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless the economy worsens, there is little sign that rent growth will slow until hundreds of thousands of new apartment units currently under construction hit the market over the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nishu Sood, a housing analyst with <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> who tracks housing costs, said that, historically, the cost to rent an apartment has been about 10% lower than the after-tax cost of owning a home. That rental discount began to fall in 2010 and disappeared entirely last year. By the end of 2011, Mr. Sood's research found that the cost to rent an apartment was about 15% higher than the cost to own a home. Conditions are "overwhelming in the favor of buying now. It is unequivocal," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Jose and the Silicon Valley, where home prices have tumbled 36% from the mid-2007 peak, home affordability has more than doubled in the last five years, Mr. Sood said. Affordability has also improved in New York's Long Island and northern New Jersey, where during the boom, renting was half as expensive as buying. Now, it is almost equal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, not all markets have seen the same development. In Orange County, Calif., and New York City, where home prices are extremely high, renting is still cheaper. But even in New York, real-estate agents said sales of small studio and one-bedroom apartments are brisk because renters don't want to pay such high amounts to rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The entry-level market is back," said Dottie Herman, president of Prudential Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jennifer Regan and her husband went into contract to buy a three-bedroom home in Martinez, Calif., last month. With a 4.25% rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage, their monthly payments, including taxes and insurance, will be about $600 less than what it costs to rent a comparable house. "I couldn't believe it had gotten so expensive" to rent, said Ms. Regan, 36 years old, who is moving before her oldest son starts school this fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't always easy for individual home buyers to make it to the closing table, however. Lending and appraisal standards remain tight, keeping many would-be buyers out of the market. And aspiring buyers are competing with savvy investors who have turned buying and reselling foreclosed homes into a business. Last week, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> trade group said the number of homes purchased by investors rose 65% during 2011 to 1.2 million, representing 27% of all sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for some renters, the housing crisis has shaken their desire to become owners. "If I was going to buy, I feel like I would be just in the same problem that other homeowners are having with the market," said Laurel Slutsky, 24, who just renewed the one-year lease on her Chicago two-bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right now, all my friends and I are hopping around neighborhoods, and I don't see the benefit in buying and staying in one place."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australia's residential-property developers could use help from the central bank. Instead, the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of Australia</span>'s decision Tuesday to keep rates on hold heaps more pressure on the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, Stockland -- one of the country's biggest developers, with a market value of $6.7 billion Australian dollars (US$6.98 billion) -- says about one in five prospective buyers that puts down a deposit on its new homes ends up canceling. Rival <span class="companylink">Mirvac Group</span>, meanwhile, is trying to diversify away from residential development, particularly at the higher end. And <span class="companylink">Lend Lease Group</span> says residential-land sale closings were down 28% in the six months to Dec. 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Negative housing data support the gloomy outlook. House prices in capital cities and surrounding suburbs were down 4.4% in the year to March 31, according to RP Data. Even more worrying, the proportion of homes now worth less than their purchase price is rising, from around 3.7% in the June quarter to 6.4% in the December quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers already are holding back on projects. In 2011, housing starts fell by 13%, according to the Housing Industry Association. This year isn't off to a great start either: Housing approvals fell nearly 8% in February from the prior month and were 15% below year-earlier levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The RBA has room to maneuver, and a cut may be coming in May. But a boost from rate cuts down the line is far from certain. Unemployment is sitting comfortably at around 5.2%, and, <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> notes, inflation could pick up, too, given that prices for rents, utilities, school fees and gasoline are all on the rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the foundations of the housing market are growing weaker, and Australia's property developers are still clutching at straws.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of commercial property sales in Manhattan fell to $5.1 billion in the first quarter, the lowest quarterly level in a year and down from $6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown reflects uncertainty over the city's economy, which remains heavily dependent on the contracting financial-services sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the results varied by sector. The apartment sector showed the most signs of growth, with 71 sales of at least $2.5 million, the most since 2007, according to Real Capital. In all, those sales totaled $1.6 billion, up from $789 million in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Trophy, luxury, residential rental buildings have sold at peak pricing and because of that there has been plenty of action," said Doug Harmon, a senior managing director at real-estate services firm Eastdil Secured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office sales fell to $2.4 billion, down from $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slow sales market comes as prices have been flat, as lending is still in short supply and buyers are wary of an uncertain economy, real estate executives say.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Address: 1435 Woodland Ave., Menlo Park</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vital Statistics: A 1,736-square-foot ranch-style home with three bedrooms and two full bathrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asking Price: $1.295 million. The house was previously listed in 2011 for $1.429 million. (The house has received multiple offers and is now under contract for more than the asking price, but the sellers are accepting backup offers, their real-estate agent says.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previous Sale Price: Owners Annie and Matt Stanley paid $985,000 for the house in December 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notable: The home is located in The Willows area of Menlo Park, where a new neighbor has moved in down the road: <span class="companylink">Facebook Inc</span>. While the median home sales price in The Willows is rising—it was $1.275 million as of March 29, up from around $1.14 million a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> agent Gwen Wang—being located just minutes from <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s headquarters hasn't so far had a huge effect on prices, say real-estate agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of people think [the <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> effect] is going to be a tsunami and I think it's going to be a ripple," says Derk Brill of Alain Pinel Realtors. Keller Williams's Ms. Wang notes while the market in The Willows is strong and inventory is low, the <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> demographic is younger and not necessarily ready to start shopping for a family home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is exactly the kind of house the Stanleys now have for sale. The couple says they spent five months and more than $250,000 remodeling the 1950s-era home, opening up the living room to create a larger entertaining space and adding oak floors and French doors that lead out to the patio. When they replaced the roof, they put in vaulted ceilings. In the kitchen, they chose granite counters and a farm sink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house was just right for the couple and their first child, but the unexpected arrival of twins (who are now 2 months old) meant the family outgrew the space sooner than planned. "We'll miss it as it's where we started our family," says Mr. Stanley, who, along with his wife, is a financial adviser.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan apartment sales remained stable during the first quarter, amid signs, brokers said, that the recovery in this affluent housing market was continuing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest market reports show strong sales among Manhattan's most expensive apartments and new developments and a pickup in sales of smaller studios and one-bedroom apartments that long have been lagging behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One report by Prudential Douglas Elliman found that the median price of a Manhattan apartment in the quarter was off by just under 1% from the year-earlier period, with sales also off slightly from the 2011 opening quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But buoyed by a record-setting $88 million sale, the same report showed that the average price of a Manhattan condo was $1.86 million, the highest in three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other reports, using different methods, reported quarterly sales up slightly and median prices up as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc. who prepared the Elliman report, attributed the flat overall prices to an uptick in sales of smaller, lower-priced apartments in the past two quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pam Liebman, president of <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>, said low-end sales were driven by a Manhattan vacancy rate of less than 1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Rents are crazy," she said. "There is a real effort by first-time home buyers to get help from family members or sympathetic banks to live the American dream and to buy rather than rent. Buyers didn't jump off the fence, they leapt."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the sales increase was driven by a wave of closings at a new glass building on East 24th Street near Lexington Avenue known as One48.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 35 studios and one-bedroom condos were sold during the quarter, according to StreetEasy.com, with many of them actually being negotiated months earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After co-op and condo sales tapered off last summer and fall amid the financial crisis in Europe, some housing analysts worried that the Manhattan market would continue to slow down this year. Employment figures suggested a slowing of the local economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But earlier this month the state labor department revised those figures sharply higher, according to Gregory J. Heym, an economist who prepares market reports for Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new figures show that despite fears of widespread layoffs in finance, 3,700 jobs were created on Wall Street last year, and 2,200 were created during January and February, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street job gains contributed to a spurt in high-end sales. The Brown Harris Stevens report said that the number of closings for apartments costing more than $10 million rose by 42% in the quarter compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers also say foreign buyers are more active now than they were during the peak of the market a few years ago. In addition, the inventory of available apartments has been shrinking, the reports found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most of reports focused on the stability on the market. Sofia Song, vice president of research at StreetEasy, said that the index based on repeated sales of the same apartments shows that the prices in Manhattan have been essentially flat since 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she said the outlook for the market was positive. The number of contracts signed during the first quarter rose 8.8% compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are steadily improving and getting better," said Diane Ramirez, president of Halstead Property. "I like steady."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Treasury prices held gains Monday after a pair of economic reports showed conflicting signals about the momentum of the U.S. economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management showed the country's manufacturing sector gathering steam, expanding in March at a faster pace than expected. Construction spending, however, unexpectedly stalled in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In midday trading, 10-year notes rose 11/32 in price to yield 2.178%, while 30-year bonds were 19/32 higher to yield 3.316%. Two-year notes added 1/32 to yield 0.321%. Bond prices move inversely to yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worries about the euro-zone economy also resurfaced Monday, fueling demand for the safety of U.S. government bonds. The number of jobless workers in the euro zone hit a record high in February, while manufacturing activity across the Continent contracted sharply again last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's gains set the Treasury market off to a positive start for the second quarter, after its worst three-month performance since late-2010.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. manufacturing sector's expansion continued in March and employment perked up, according to data released Monday by the Institute for Supply Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, spending on construction projects in the U.S. fell for the second consecutive month in February, showing the struggling sector is failing to build upon the momentum seen late last year. The ISM's manufacturing purchasing managers' index rose last month to 53.4 from 52.4 in February. A reading above 50 indicates expanding activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected the March PMI to increase to 53.0. According to the ISM report, the U.S. factory sector has been expanding for 32 consecutive months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European manufacturers, however, are struggling. Earlier Monday, Markit Economics said its purchasing managers' index for the euro zone dropped to 47.7 in March from 49.0 in February. That was the eighth straight sub-50 reading, signalling contraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. ISM subindexes last month were generally improved. The new orders index stood at 54.5 in March from 54.9 in February, while the production index jumped to 58.3 from 55.3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The factory employment index increased to 56.1 last month from 53.2. The inventory index edged up to 50.0 from 49.5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign demand is expanding but at a slower pace. The exports index fell to 54.0 from 59.5. Price pressures stayed high, although the prices index fell a bit to 61.0 from 61.5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending decreased by 1.1% in February -- the biggest drop since July -- to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $808.86 billion, the Commerce Department said Monday. And spending in January was revised down to a 0.8% fall from an originally reported 0.1% decline. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a 0.7% gain for February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private nonresidential construction -- including office, commercial and infrastructure building -- drove the decline, falling 1.6% in February to $280.84 billion. That loss came on top of a 2.3% decline in the category in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall private-sector spending on construction decreased 0.8% in February to $527.29 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building industry suffered greatly during the financial crisis, shedding more than 2 million jobs between 2006 and 2011. More recently, the sector has somewhat regained its footing, adding nearly 100,000 jobs in the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Monday's report showed spending on residential construction stayed flat in February at $253.46 billion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's Builders Upbeat</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's property developers are still building. That is bad news for house prices, but it should be reassurance on the outlook for growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate investment is a major chunk of China's gross domestic product. In 2011, the International Monetary Fund estimated its contribution was 12%. That number goes even higher if upstream industries like steel and cement and downstream sectors like appliances and consumer durables are factored in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Official data show house prices and sales falling, posting a big risk for the Chinese economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that is a snapshot in time, not a look forward. For a glimpse into the future, it is worth taking a look at what developers are saying about their plans for investment. With many of the mainland's biggest developers delivering their 2011 annual reports in the past few weeks, the prognosis isn't so bad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. 1 developer by sales <span class="companylink">China Vanke</span> is forecasting completion of 8.9 million square meters of residential property in 2012, up 35% from 2011. China Overseas Land &amp; Investment and <span class="companylink">Longfor Properties</span> -- both in the top 10 -- are expecting increases of 34% and 23%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the downside, No. 2 developer <span class="companylink">Evergrande Real Estate</span> says it will turn its focus "from growth in scale to stable operation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Land sales may take a hit as developers focus on using existing reserves rather than buying more. Evergrande says its national land footprint is "basically complete."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers also need to be treated with caution. In a fragmented market, even giants like Vanke represent only a fraction of total construction. And plans can also be altered midcourse if market conditions change. For the real-estate sector, higher completion rates will add to the existing overhang of unsold property and pressure for prices to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time though, the developers' plans suggest that the worst fears of a collapse in private real-estate construction taking a chunk out of GDP growth may be overdone. With talk of a China slowdown weighing on stocks, that should provide investors with a little relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Tom Orlik</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's No Monsoon for</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong Tycoons</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The humiliation of a pair of Hong Kong property tycoons carted off to answer allegations they bribed a government official has rocked the city. <span class="companylink">Sun Hung Kai Properties</span>, the development company where Raymond Kwok and Thomas Kwok are co-chairmen -- has already taken a beating. But don't expect radical changes in relations between Hong Kong's political and business elites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tycoons, especially billionaires such as the Kwoks, are supposed to be untouchable. Everyone knows the Hong Kong game is loaded in their favor. For years they have enjoyed a cozy relationship with the government that gave them a near-monopoly on Hong Kong's most precious resource: land. They are among the chosen few allowed to vote on the city's leadership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has enabled people like the Kwoks and Hong Kong's richest man, Li Ka-Shing, to become extremely wealthy. Supercharged profits from their property empires, and political connections, enabled them to extend their empires to control the island's utilities and shops. It's difficult to breathe in Hong Kong without somehow adding to their fortunes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the Kwoks' arrest will cause some jitters, doubly so as it comes just days after the election of Leung Chung-ying as Hong Kong's next chief executive. Mr. Leung campaigned on a pledge to provide more lower-income housing, a platform that garnered little support from the tycoons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of the arrest, the share price of Sun Hung Kai properties fell 13% Friday. Other developers dipped in sympathy, with Henderson Land and <span class="companylink">Sino Land</span> down about 3% and 3.5%, respectively. <span class="companylink">UBS</span> says that Sun Hung Kai could fall by an additional third as more details emerge, and that any company with links to the Hong Kong government is at risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That might be going too far. Even before the Kwoks' arrest, property stocks were looking overpriced. <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> analyst Andrew Lawrence noted that a likely fall in office rents and residential property prices in 2012 was not factored into prices. Mainland buyers have pushed Hong Kong property prices up sharply since the financial crisis. A slowdown in China will surely be felt in the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the new administration goes beyond the Kwok arrest to strike at the tycoon system itself remains to be seen. A lot of investors have gotten rich off the current system, and property is crucial to the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That the city's antigraft police agency is now seeking to assert itself over allegations of corruption at the highest levels is understandably big news in Hong Kong. It doesn't follow that the system itself is under threat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Duncan Mavin</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smoke, Mirrors, Deficits:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors Should Beware</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are public debt and deficit numbers illusory? Perhaps, judging by the ruses employed by governments and identified by the International Monetary Fund's Timothy Irwin in a recent staff note. Deficit crises in developed countries may increase the allure of such devices, though they may be of little help long term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European countries got creative as they strove to hit targets to join the single currency during the 1990s. In 2005, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development researchers cataloged 192 cases of one-time measures and accounting maneuvers, 50 in Greece alone. Effects ranged from negligible to 2% of GDP. In 1997, France took on the pension liabilities of <span class="companylink">France Telecom</span> in exchange for a payment of 5.7 billion euros ($7.6 billion), or 0.5% of GDP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Europe wasn't alone in playing games. In 2003, the U.S. proposed buying 100 refueling planes via operating leases, which would have kept the cost from being recognized upfront. The Congressional Budget Office said that was federal borrowing in disguise and would prove more expensive than a normal purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro-zone debt crisis has exposed these techniques. Portugal hit its 2011 target only by transferring bank pension assets that shaved 3.5 percentage points off its deficit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, the U.K. is taking on the <span class="companylink">Royal Mail</span>'s pension plan to pave the way for privatization. The plan brings with it GBP 28 billion ($44.8 billion) of assets, thereby reducing the country's 2012-13 deficit. But the U.K. is also taking on long-term liabilities on behalf of the company with a present value of GBP 37.5 billion. So accounting transforms the <span class="companylink">Royal Mail</span>'s pension deficit into a short-term gain for the U.K. budget but at a long-term cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keeping long-term liabilities out of the picture is a common tactic: In the U.S., debt was 62% of GDP in 2010, but including civil-service pension and other liabilities raises the total to 113%, Mr. Irwin notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crisis has narrowed governments' options. One way to flatter the statistics is via optimistic growth assumptions, although skeptical markets and the rise of independent fiscal watchdogs make this difficult. Another way is to shift cash flows forward, though that, too, may now prove a tricky sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors trying to keep track of governments should remember Goodhart's law: As soon as an indicator becomes a target for conducting policy, it loses its informational value. It also becomes a target for manipulation. The euro zone's obsession with deficit targets might just hide problems emerging elsewhere.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">April Fools' Day marks the unofficial start of the spring home-buying season, although, as any full-commissioned real-estate broker will tell you, it is "always a good time to buy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the weeks to come, you will hear more about the ever-recovering housing market. Real-estate agents are experts at not only saying "always a good time to buy," but "you will never see another deal like this again," in the same breath.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales are indeed ticking up, but this is still largely driven by investors paying cash for distressed properties and turning them into rentals for people who no longer have the credit to buy homes. Prices, meantime, are still going down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the optimists aren't very optimistic. Last week, the Urban Land Institute released its survey of 38 real-estate economists and analysts, predicting home prices will finally begin to rise next year and increase 3.5% in 2014. That hardly spells relief when home prices are down 34% since the bust began and have actually hit 2002 levels—marking a lost decade for homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>' TV commercial went like this: "When you have a family, it's always a good time to buy. …It's a great move-up market. …This is the best market in years in terms of choice."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then in 2008, after the real-estate market was more clearly in a sustained free-fall, the group put out another TV ad: "Buyer opportunities have never been better. …A home isn't just a great place to raise a family. It's also the key to building long-term wealth. On average, the value of a home nearly doubles every 10 years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then in 2009, as foreclosures and short sales blighted the land: "We've all heard about problems on Wall Street affecting people on Main Street, but if you're in a position to buy a home, you're in a position of strength. …8 out of 10 economists agree that home prices will rise in the next five years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, and, "More doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarette."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2011, the Realtors group dropped its promise of rising prices and appealed to patriotism: "America needs jobs and housing creates them. For every two homes sold, one job is created."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors were creating more jobs when they were selling mansions to the underemployed. The market collapsed because, like all markets, it ran out of greater fools. Now it needs more. So please, step right up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index came out last week showing home prices fell in January for a fifth straight month in most major U.S. cities. The foreclosure crisis, while easing slightly, is still dragging down prices even as home sales improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also in January, about 1.4 million homes, or 3.3% of all homes with a mortgage, were in foreclosure, compared with 1.5 million, or 3.6%, a year ago, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a real-estate data provider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there's what I call foreclosures-waiting-to-happen. Nearly 23% of the 48.7 million mortgaged homes in America are currently underwater, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>'s latest negative-equity report. This is the highest number of homeowners who owe more on their homes than what they are worth since 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least the Realtors' current commercial is in touch with this reality. It features a grandpa fearful of losing his home to foreclosure, but putting up a hopeful front for his grandson: "For the first time in generations, the dream of homeownership is being threatened. Realtors…are here to represent you."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if it's not really a good time.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">As Prices Fall, Chinese Developers Still Hungry for Growth</span>
</div><div class="author">By Tom Orlik  </div><div>456 words</div><div>31 March 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B16</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's property developers are still building. That is bad news for house prices, but it should be reassurance on the outlook for growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate investment is a major chunk of China's gross domestic product. In 2011, the International Monetary Fund estimated its contribution was 12%. That number goes even higher if upstream industries like steel and cement and downstream sectors like appliances and consumer durables are factored in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With house prices and sales both falling, the biggest risk for the Chinese economy is a sharp slowdown in construction. Official data paint a bleak picture, with zero growth in new residential floor space under construction in the first two months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that is a record of building that has taken place already -- not a look forward. For a glimpse into the future, it is worth taking a look at what developers themselves are saying about their plans for investment. With many of the mainland's biggest developers delivering their 2011 annual reports in the past few weeks, the prognosis isn't so bad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. 1 developer by sales <span class="companylink">China Vanke</span> is forecasting completion of 96 million square feet of residential property in 2012, up 35% from 2011. China Overseas Land &amp; Investment and <span class="companylink">Longfor Properties</span> -- both in the top 10 -- are expecting increases of 34% and 23%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't all good news. No. 2 developer <span class="companylink">Evergrande Real Estate</span> says it will turn its focus "from growth in scale to stable operation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Land sales may take a hit as developers focus on using existing reserves rather than buying more. Evergrande says its national land footprint is "basically complete." That is bad news for local governments that rely on land sales to generate revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers also need to be treated with caution. In a fragmented market, even giants like Vanke represent only a fraction of total construction. The biggest developers have the most solid finances and the most capacity to carry on building through the downturn. Plans can also be altered midcourse if market conditions change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the big developers' forecasts do allow at least some tentative conclusions to be drawn. For the real-estate sector, higher completion rates will add to the existing overhang of unsold property and pressure for prices to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time though, the developers' plans suggest that the worst fears of a collapse in private real-estate construction taking a chunk out of GDP growth may be overdone. With talk of a China slowdown weighing on stocks, that should provide investors with a little relief.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Dawn Wotapka </div><div>672 words</div><div>30 March 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of investment and vacation homes surged last year, the latest evidence that investors and higher-income households are taking advantage of low home prices to scoop up bargains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its annual survey of investment- and vacation-home sales, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> found that the number of homes purchased by investors rose 65% during 2011 to 1.2 million, accounting for 27% of all home sales. In 2010, investment properties accounted for 17% of all sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes purchased as second or vacation homes jumped 7% last year to 502,000 -- accounting for 11% of all transactions, up from 10% of all sales in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the majority of homes sold last year went to traditional buyers who plan to use the home as a primary residence, their presence in the market declined to 61% from 73% in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the housing boom, speculators were blamed for helping to inflate the bubble by snapping up homes, especially new homes, and then quickly reselling them as prices rose higher. That led to overbuilding. Some economists now believe that investors are helping to stabilize the market by buying up excess inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While their activities could help to stabilize prices, they also are creating problems for some buyers. Real-estate agents say investors, and to a smaller extent vacation-home buyers, are outmaneuvering traditional buyers, who are less likely to have the financial means to pay cash for a home and may not devote as much time to searching for properties. The NAR survey found that nearly half of all investors and 42% of vacation-home buyers purchased their homes using cash. Traditional buyers, meanwhile, are seeing deals derailed because they can't qualify for a mortgage or because appraisals for the homes they are trying to buy or sell come in too low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The last two to three years has been a battle between the first-time home buyer and the investor," said Budge S. Huskey, president of <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker Real Estate LLC</span>, a national franchiser based in Parsippany, N.J. "Investors have won."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some of the hardest-hit housing markets, investors are the largest category of buyers. But unlike during the boom years, when many investors were buying properties to "flip" quickly for a profit, many of today's investors buy the homes with plans to rent them out and sell them when the market improves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Obviously, it's a great rental market, and it's going to be a great rental market for a while," said Geoffrey Jacobs, principal at <span class="companylink">Empire Group</span>, a developer that has amassed a portfolio of nearly 1,000 single-family homes in Phoenix since 2009. Because the typical home that he buys is only about 10 years old, "it'll compete well with a new home down the road when we go to sell the houses," Mr. Jacobs said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid increased demand from investors, real-estate agents say there aren't enough foreclosed homes in good condition available in some markets, including parts of California and Florida. Buyers are "begging for properties," Mr. Huskey said. "There is an insatiable demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirty percent of vacation-home buyers said they plan to use the property as a primary residence in the future, indicating that buyers who can afford to take advantage of low prices and low interest rates to buy their future retirement homes are doing so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, Sarah Donovan, who owns a home in Littleton, Mass., purchased a roughly $300,000 vacation home on Cape Cod. "My husband has wanted a house on the Cape for about 20 years," said Ms. Donovan, a stay-at-home mother who made an offer near the asking price the day she saw the three-bedroom home with a guesthouse. "The Cape market is coming back with decent housing prices, and we didn't want to miss out," she said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices fell to new lows in January, but the rate of decline appeared to be easing, offering the latest hint that prices may be at or near a bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices dropped 0.8% in the three-month period that ended in January, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index that tracks 20 U.S. metro areas. While that lowered the index to levels not seen since the end of 2002, the monthly decline improved from a drop of 1.1% in December and 1.3% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices tend to weaken during the winter months, when sales activity slows and the share of "distressed" home sales, such as foreclosures, rises. After adjusting for seasonal factors, prices were flat in January compared with December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with one year ago, home prices fell 3.8% in January. That also represented an improvement over the 4.1% year-over-year decline for December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's report "adds to other evidence that the housing market is on the mend," said Paul Dales, senior U.S. economist for Capital Economics. "We expect that 2012 will go down in history as the year that the most severe house-price crash on record ended."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices fell to new lows in nine cities, led by Atlanta, which was down 14.8% from a year ago. But three cities posted year-over-year increases: Detroit (1.7%), Phoenix (1.3%) and Denver (0.2%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a seasonally adjusted basis, half of the 20 markets showed flat or increasing prices in January when compared with December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing markets face significant headwinds. Nearly 11 million homeowners owe more on their mortgages than their houses are worth, and more than one million homes could sell out of foreclosure this year, putting pressure on prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any stabilization in home prices, however, could offer a big boost to fragile consumer psychology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you ask people why are they in the market right now they tell you, 'Because home prices have stopped falling in some sickening way,'" said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin Corp., a Seattle-based brokerage. "They worry they could lose a little bit, but there was a time you really had to close your eyes before signing an offer, and hope you weren't going to lose 10% of your equity in 12 months."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks edged lower as consumer-confidence and home-price data met economists' expectations but failed to excite investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major benchmarks were unchanged for much of the day but slipped lower minutes before the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 43.90 points, or 0.3%, to 13197.73. The blue chips had rallied Monday, recouping all of last week's retreat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index dipped 3.99 points, or 0.3%, to 1412.52. Financials and energy shares paced the decline. Utilities and health care, sectors typically seen as defensive, rose. The Nasdaq Composite retreated 2.22 points, or less than 0.1%, to 3120.35.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we're at kind of a breather point," said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at <span class="companylink">Synovus</span> Trust. "The market's a little exhausted today."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumers in March remained confident about the economy and labor markets, according to a report by the Conference Board. The private research group's index dropped to 70.2 in March from an upwardly revised February reading of 71.6, which was the highest in a year. This month's figure was close to the 70 anticipated by economists in a Dow Jones Newswires poll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices fell in January from a month earlier, hitting 2003 levels, according to <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home-price index.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald Trump's appetite for real-estate risk has returned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developer, who became more risk-averse after getting clobbered in the early 1990s, largely avoided the carnage of the latest downturn by mostly limiting his deal making during the boom years to licensing the Trump name to other developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But earlier this year he closed on a $150 million purchase of the Doral Golf Resort and Spa, taking it out of a bankruptcy proceeding. And a venture of Mr. Trump and <span class="companylink">Colony Capital LLC</span> plans to invest about $200 million to convert the historic Old Post Office Building in Washington to a hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mr. Trump is placing a new bet. He is doubling-down on the Trump International Hotel and Tower Chicago, the second-tallest building in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump paid $48 million earlier this month to buy out junior creditors led by <span class="companylink">Fortress Investment Group</span> on the 92-story hotel and condominium tower, according to people familiar with the matter. The Fortress group's debt, which could have turned into a big headache for Mr. Trump, was originally about $130 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chicago property was one of Mr. Trump's few exceptions to his avoid-risk rule during the boom years. He sunk about $73 million of his own money into the tower, which opened in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest deal represents a vote of confidence by Mr. Trump in the project, which has been hurt by weak hotel-condo sales and falling prices, and caused years of friction between Mr. Trump and lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is betting that demand for high-end Chicago condos priced for more than $1 million each will rebound strongly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent deals include the purchase a $2.8 million unit in the building by Chicago Bulls basketball star Derrick Rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is far from clear whether Mr. Trump ultimately will make any money on his investment. "Call me in five years," Mr. Trump said Tuesday. He added: "I view my prior investment as a sunk cost."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers had closed on 337 of the Trump Chicago's 486 residential condos, or about 69% of the building's inventory, at the end of 2011, according to Appraisal Research Counselors, a Chicago appraisal firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building also has 339 hotel-condo units, which are sold to investors and double as hotel rooms when the owner isn't there. Only 159 of these were sold at the end of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, Mr. Trump and his daughter, Ivanka, the <span class="companylink">Trump Organization</span>'s executive vice president for development and acquisitions, bought the Florida-based Doral golf course for $150 million. The company plans to invest $150 million to $200 million more to renovate its 700-room hotel and five professional golf courses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By ramping up his deal making, Mr. Trump is joining investors who believe that real estate offers the prospect of better returns than competing investments like stocks or bonds. He is focusing on assets he knows best -- like resorts and golf courses -- and especially when he is buying assets out of bankruptcy or other distressed situations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, like other investors who want to buy real estate, Mr. Trump has no choice but to put in his own equity because there is little debt available or it is too expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he first started out in real estate, Mr. Trump was one of the biggest risk-takers in the business. But he learned a painful lesson during the recession of the early 1990s when he was unable to pay hundreds of millions of dollars worth of debt. He engineered a comeback but with less of an appetite for such high risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He deviated from this strategy with just a few projects, most notably the Chicago tower, which broke ground in 2004 near the height of the housing boom and cost about $850 million to construct. With easy credit available, Mr. Trump loaded the project up with a $640 million construction loan from <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span> and $130 million of junior debt originated by Fortress. Both firms later sold most of these loans to other investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project initially looked like a success. Mr. Trump raised asking prices on the residential condos to more than $1,000 a square foot from about $600 and started paying down loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after the recession hit, condo sales slowed, leaving Mr. Trump without enough cash to pay the $334 million balance on his construction loan when it matured in late 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump and his lender, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>, traded lawsuits before the bank in 2009 agreed to extend the term of the loan -- which currently has a balance of about $125 million -- through July 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that still left the problem of the the loan from the Fortress group, which was steadily growing as it accrued interest. Given the decline in condo sales and prices, it became increasingly clear that Mr. Trump would have a difficult time paying it back when it came due in about three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Failure to do so would have put the project at risk of foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump's deal to buy that junior debt hit Fortress with a loss but leaves the Chicago tower with a much more manageable amount of debt.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson </div><div>767 words</div><div>28 March 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Veteran investor Barry Sternlicht is close to making his biggest push to date into the shopping mall industry as his <span class="companylink">Starwood Capital Group</span> prepares to buy majority stakes in seven U.S. malls from <span class="companylink">Westfield Group</span> for roughly $1 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The identity of the seven malls couldn't be determined on Tuesday. However, five of the seven are among the 17 U.S. malls that Sydney-based Westfield put on the market early last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westfield, which owns 118 malls globally, has stated publicly since last year that it will divest some of its midscale malls to raise capital for several billion dollars of redevelopment work at its more lucrative properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westfield will retain a minority stake in the properties being sold, but the percentage remains in flux, these people say. The deal isn't completed, and the terms could change or it could fall apart at the last minute, they added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founded in 1991, Starwood has roughly $18 billion in assets under management and a track record of some major hits, including its creation of the <span class="companylink">Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide Inc</span>. chain and <span class="companylink">iStar Financial Inc</span>., a finance company that went public in 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this also is a treacherous time to make a big bet on the retail industry, which is battling headwinds from a weak economy, competition from online shopping and overbuilding during the boom years. It also is facing the ongoing closure of hundreds of stores by mall stalwarts such as <span class="companylink">Sears Holdings Corp</span>., <span class="companylink">Gap Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The malls that Starwood Capital aims to buy have annual sales that are at or only slightly higher than the industry average for large, enclosed U.S. malls, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That presents a challenge for Starwood Capital, since many mall owners and industry experts predict that shoppers and retailers increasingly will patronize stronger malls to the detriment of average and subpar malls. Investments in mediocre shopping centers can be successful if the properties can be rehabilitated and returned to higher prominence. Others may be doomed to obsolescence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Not all B [grade] malls are created equal," says Ben Yang, an analyst tracking real-estate investment trusts for Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc. "Some could be B-plus malls in the future, and some could be C malls at some point."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starwood Capital has hired brokerage Eastdil Secured to help it line up mortgages to put on three of the malls, these people say. It will assume the mortgages already in place on another three. The financing status of the seventh couldn't be determined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The retail outlook isn't totally bleak, especially if the economy improves. Stoking buyers' optimism, U.S. retail property has shown slight improvement since its nadir during the recession. Vacancy rates have stopped rising, though they remain just shy of multiyear highs. Construction of new shopping centers is minimal, meaning that existing properties face little new competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the top 54 U.S. markets, retailers are adding more square footage than they forfeit. Real-estate-research company CoStar Group predicts that retailers will expand their occupied space in those markets by 0.9% this year, 1.1% next and 1.2% in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers, meanwhile, have ramped up their activity. In 2009, deal activity for U.S. malls larger than 500,000 square feet totaled $873 million, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. Last year, the mall-deal tally jumped to nearly $3.7 billion. Real Capital analysts foresee further increases in transactions for all classes of retail properties, noting in a report this month that $8 billion in retail-real-estate deals now are classified as under contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is possible that Westfield will sell additional U.S. malls in the wake of the Starwood Capital deal, a person familiar with the matter said. Bidders such as Atlanta-based Greenfield &amp; Associates showed interest last year. In February, Westfield agreed to sell a 45% stake in 11 of its 55 U.S. malls and one mall-development site to the <span class="companylink">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span> for nearly $2.2 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other mall owners haven't had much luck in selling their struggling malls. <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group Inc</span>. last year listed four midscale malls for sale but eventually took them off the market. <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties Inc</span>. opted to spin off 30 of its weaker malls as <span class="companylink">Rouse Properties Inc</span>. last January rather than sell them.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Neil Shah and Nick Timiraos   </div><div>946 words</div><div>27 March 2012</div><div>09:58</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market, a notable soft spot in the nation's weak economy for the past four years, is becoming less of a drag on the recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate markets are showing signs of life as falling prices spur buyer demand, lifting home sales and new construction from the depressed levels of the past three years. The spring selling season, traditionally the busiest period of the year, appears to be off to its best start in five years. Sales of existing homes in January and February were at their highest level since 2007, according to data out Wednesday, though sales in February edged down by 0.9% from January on a seasonally adjusted basis. The decline in real-estate prices has slowed its pace, making Americans less cautious about spending and potentially more disposed to buy a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time since 2005, investment in residential real-estate, including home building and renovation, has contributed to U.S. economic output for the past three quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Granted, the housing market continues to struggle. Home prices have yet to hit bottom, and credit standards remain tight. Nearly 11 million homeowners owe more than their properties are worth, while a glut of potential foreclosures still threatens markets. With housing a much smaller part of the U.S. economy after the financial crisis, ripple effects from improvements may pack less punch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also isn't clear that more people looking to purchase homes will translate into more sales later this year. The mildest U.S. winter in decades may have shifted buyers' timing. Rising gasoline prices and mortgage rates could make consumers leery of buying now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, many economists say home sales and construction have likely hit bottom and are now starting to contribute to the nation's recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing bottoming is going to surprise a lot of people," said Kenneth Rosen, a housing economist at the University of California, Berkeley. "Housing was pulling us down consistently, quarter after quarter, for years. That was really over in 2011."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A housing stabilization could put the recovery on more solid footing. Growth in manufacturing outpaced expansion in the broader economy when the recovery began in the second half of 2009, and the job market has picked up recently, instilling confidence in consumers and businesses and giving landlords room to raise rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents and home builders from Florida to the Midwest and California are reporting more activity as buyers take advantage of prices that are down by one-third from their peak as well as low interest rates that have made housing more affordable than at any time in the last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are looking around saying 'It's costing me more to rent than to buy,' " says Ronald Peltier, chief executive of HomeServices of America Inc., which owns real-estate brokerages in 21 states. Home-purchase contracts in January and February are up about 20% from a year earlier for HomeServices, a subsidiary of <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway Inc</span>., and Mr. Peltier said the firm now expects sales growth of around 10% this year, upgrading its forecast last fall for flat sales levels in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some businesses are seeing signs that an improving housing market will help the recovery by creating jobs. Home builder <span class="companylink">Taylor Morrison Inc</span>., of Scottsdale, Ariz., is seeing higher demand and hiring more workers for its Orlando, Fla., office. Last month, about 100 people flocked to an event showcasing a new residential development in Houston, the firm said. Days later, Taylor Morrison secured 21 sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Blake, CEO of home-improvement retailer <span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>., told analysts last month that investment in residential homes "had a slight uptick" from November to January relative to the size of the U.S. economy. "The performance of our business, particularly in the back half of 2011, would suggest a strengthening market," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> executives have seen demand from customers seeking to remodel and repair their homes. But in recent months, the retailer saw a 3% jump in transactions of $900 or more, compared with a 1.3% rise in purchases totaling $50 or less. That suggests consumers are spending more on bigger items and could be outfitting homes with an eye to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents say one problem with today's housing market is a lack of inventory. The number of homes listed for sale is down sharply from one year ago in much of the country. That may stem partly from would-be sellers waiting for prices to firm up. Also, mortgage applications are still falling, suggesting any increase in sales activity is being driven heavily by buyers paying cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers such as Jessica Ontiveros are running into bidding wars on properties. In December, she was under contract to buy a one-bedroom condominium in Corona, Calif., for $83,000 with a 10% down payment. However, the property fell out of escrow after Ms. Ontiveros ran into trouble obtaining a mortgage. Last week, she made a $200,000 bid on a three-bedroom home, but the property already had two offers. "I heard buying a home was going to be easy, but anything I can afford, an investor will come in and pay cash for it," said Ms. Ontiveros, a 26-year-old high school Spanish teacher who is living at home. She's anxious because "prices seem to be going up. I check almost every single day."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks edged lower as investors shrugged off consumer-confidence and home-price data that were in line with economists' expectations.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we're at kind of a breather point," said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at <span class="companylink">Synovus</span> Trust. "The market's a little exhausted today."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos   </div><div>443 words</div><div>27 March 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of contracts signed to buy homes in February eased slightly from January, but represented another strong gain from a year ago -- the latest sign that demand for homes is up from the depressed levels of the previous 18 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report Monday by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> showed the index of pending home sales, reflecting deals that have gone into contract but haven't yet closed, rose 9.2% last month from a year earlier, continuing a rise largely fueled by investors' purchases of foreclosed properties. The index fell by 0.5% from January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While buyers are starting to step forward, however, home builders and real-estate agents report an elevated level of contracts falling apart, as buyers run into trouble qualifying for mortgages amid tough lending standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another common complaint: low appraisals that come in below a negotiated value, requiring sellers to cut their price or buyers to put more money down in order to keep a deal from collapsing. As a result, the pending sales figures could be overstating actual sales as buyers sign multiple contracts over the course of several months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, analysts say that housing demand appears to be stronger than at any point in the past year. Low prices are luring investors who can convert properties into rental units and make double-digit returns. Also, more first-time buyers could face added urgency to move as landlords begin to raise rents and mortgage rates rise from record lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are seeing very strong activity out there," said Ivy Zelman, chief executive of research firm Zelman &amp; Associates. "We're not ready yet to wave the victory flag and say home prices are going up, but we're confident they're stabilizing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's report showed that purchase activity was up 18.4% and 19% from a year ago in the Northeast and Midwest, respectively, after an unseasonably warm winter. Contract activity fell by 1.8% in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents in many parts of the country say inventories of homes for sale are declining, leaving more buyers competing for less supply. Shrinking inventories could be a consequence of the decline in home prices, which has left more sellers unable or unwilling to sell their homes at a loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Orange County, Calif., the number of homes listed for sale is down by 36% from a year ago. Meanwhile, the number of homes under contract is up 25% to its highest level in four years, according to Steven Thomas, a local housing-market analyst.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One usually thinks of start-ups as cutting-edge. But it turns out the hottest growth area for new businesses isn't so sexy: It's construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More entrepreneurs are setting up construction companies, according to a report released earlier this week. The increase comes as construction workers who lost their jobs during the slump in the housing market start their own businesses, taking advantage of a recent uptick in home remodeling and a modest boost in new home construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Improvements in home building last year meant that new construction firms were not swimming against as strong a current as in the previous four years," says Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist for the <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group</span> in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New entrepreneurs entering construction accounted for 24% of all U.S. entrepreneurial activity in 2011, a year when overall business creation dropped by about 6%, according to recent estimates by the <span class="companylink">Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation</span>, a nonprofit organization that studies entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate of entrepreneurial activity in construction was 1.7% in 2011, up from 1.6% in 2010 and 1.2% in 2007, the Kauffman report says. The activity rate is a measure of the percentage of the adult, non-business-owner population that starts a business each month, using data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Kauffman says. The construction category includes restoration, remodeling and painting firms, in both commercial and residential markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billy Kern of Raleigh, N.C., says he struck out on his own as a general contractor after he was laid off from a small construction company in 2009. Last year, he bought a Mr. Handyman franchise. "I figured I'd stay with my strengths," says the 49-year-old, rather than try a career in a new field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employment in construction increased on a seasonally adjusted basis to 5.5 million in December 2011 from 5.4 million a year earlier, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the industry still has a far way to go to reach prerecession levels: In 2006, monthly measurements of construction employment surpassed seven million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, services businesses represent the biggest slice of the U.S. economy, as they have for more than a decade. The services sector accounted for 54% of all start-ups last year, Kauffman says. But the rate of entrepreneurial activity in services—which ranges from accounting and consulting businesses to beauty salons and graphic-design shops—held steady in 2011 at just 0.4%, about the same as in 2010 as well as in 2007, according to Kauffman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2011 rate of entrepreneurial activity in all industries was 5% higher than the rate before the recession started, the Kansas City, Mo., research group says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, measuring entrepreneurship is somewhat tricky. A study released in January from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor found that the number of Americans actively engaged in starting or running a new business increased 60% last year from 2010. But that study measured a wider pool of new business owners, including entrepreneurs with businesses up to three-and-a-half years old, as well as those just starting out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're looking at the people that are in the process of starting a business and haven't yet paid salaries to themselves or employees, so they may not identify themselves yet as self employed," says Donna Kelley, lead author of the GEM report and an associate professor of entrepreneurship at <span class="companylink">Babson College</span> in Wellesley, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics says self-employed Americans with incorporated and non-incorporated businesses declined 2% last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Any new business is always swimming against the tide in terms of survival," <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services</span>' Mr. Hoffman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been some positive signs for construction start-ups. Spending on additions and alterations to single-family homes rose to $116 billion in 2011 from $112 billion in 2009, according to the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remodeling work, which in past years typically represented just one quarter of spending on new construction, now has surpassed overall spending on new construction, the trade group says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multiunit housing construction also picked up in 2011, and single-unit housing construction is expected to improve, as well, with new permits for the latter category rising to 472,000 in February from 382,000 a year earlier, according to data from the Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matthew Hopkins of Thomaston, Conn., says he launched a home and business remodeling company last year after he was laid off from a large highway-construction company in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's something I know well. It's what I'm trained to do," says the 25-year-old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hopkins says "things are looking up," even though he isn't earning as much with his own business as he did as an employee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My niche is to do a lot of small jobs. There's a lot of work to be done if you're willing to do the little odds and ends," he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ugly duckling of top-end Manhattan real-estate listings is a six-story building on Fifth Avenue at East 62nd Street divided into a dozen offices and apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The asking price for the 25-foot-wide former Italianate mansion at 815 Fifth Ave. was $25 million when it went on the market last week. But brokers are saying it is attracting competing offers from around the world and will likely trade for more. The would-be buyers are looking to restore long-hidden details and transform the property back into an elegant private mansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The listing came to market as part of a surge this year in ultra-expensive residential listings, the strongest segment of the Manhattan market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the active market, the listing broker, Darren Sukenik of Prudential Douglas Elliman, has set a noon Tuesday deadline for the submission of sealed bids. He said four buyers had shown "strong interest" soon after the property was listed last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you want to live on Fifth Avenue in a private home, this is it," he said. "It will sell for well over the asking price."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other brokers said the listing was catching a strong wave in the luxury market, with a rare chance to re-create a Fifth Avenue mansion for a relatively low price. Another, larger 25-foot-wide mansion that has more original details but is in need of work has been listed for $49 million since last June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 62nd Street building, one of the oldest surviving structures on Fifth Avenue, was stripped of most of its ornamentation in the 1920s. Still, it has touches of glory: carved fireplace mantels tucked behind desks in offices; intricate moldings; oval ceiling details; and an elaborate wooden banister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An open house for buyers and their architects and contractors has been scheduled for Monday morning, and brokers said the interested buyers include a Russian, a Chinese, a Brazilian and an American.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kirk Henckels, director of private brokerage at <span class="companylink">Stribling &amp; Associates</span>, said said he expects the house to sell at $40 million or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is going to be a real bellwether test of the market, especially the foreign market," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everything on Fifth Avenue that has a view is going in one or two days," said Carrie Chiang, the top-selling broker in Manhattan at <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. "But the not-good ones are sitting."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unusual sealed-bid auction comes at a time when some sellers who held back during the downturn have begun putting properties on the uber-luxury market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first two months of the year, 27 properties priced at more than $20 million came on the market, compared with 12 during the same period a year earlier, according to figures compiled by StreetEasy. New listings for $10 million or more were up by 43%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building at 815 Fifth Ave. has a powerful draw: It could be turned into the only privately owned mansion below 73rd Street, the most exclusive end of the most exclusive street in New York, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A landmarks report listed the original style of the building as Italianate and the current style as "none." The report said that in 1923 the front stoop, Juliet balconies and cornices were removed, and large picture windows were installed on the top floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preservationists say this very lack of authentic detail could give the new owner more latitude in re-creating the original facade and perhaps even adding space on the roof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although there are about two-dozen surviving mansions on Fifth Avenue on the Upper East Side, only a quarter are in the hands of private owners. The others have been transformed into consulates, museums, schools and foundations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer would join an exclusive group of private Fifth Avenue mansion dwellers, according to property records, including: philanthropist Ronald S. Lauder, hedge-fund manager Bruce Kovner, developer Leonard Stern and <span class="companylink">Loews Corp</span>. Chairman James Tisch and his wife, Merryl, the chancellor of the state Board of Regents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, Carlos Slim, the Mexican billionaire, paid $44 million for a townhouse on the corner of East 82nd Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the high current sticker prices, Fifth Avenue mansions weren't always so pricy. The current owner, a real-estate investor, bought 815 Fifth Ave. for $120,000 in the early 1950s and converted it into an apartment building, Mr. Sukenik said. The owner lives on one floor in the building, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other Fifth Avenue building on the market, at East 79th Street, listed at $49 million with Paula Del Nuncio of Brown Harris Stevens. It is being sold by the estate of Victor Shafferman, a business executive who died in 2009. He paid an arm of the Mormon Church $600,000 for the house, designed by Stanford White, in 1977, property records show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building at 815 Fifth Ave. was erected in 1870-71 and is one of two standing buildings on Fifth Avenue that face Central Park dating from those years. The other is the residence of the Iranian ambassador to the <span class="companylink">United Nations</span>, near East 84th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A landmarks commission report said the building at 815 Fifth Ave. is in fact the oldest on the avenue.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan and Dawn Wotapka </div><div>732 words</div><div>24 March 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The optimism blossoming in the housing market took a hit Friday as <span class="companylink">KB Home</span>, one of the nation's largest home builders, reported disappointing quarterly results and weak orders for future home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news depressed shares across the sector, with <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> ending the day down 8.5% at $10.29 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Competitors Beazer Homes USA Inc. declined by nearly 5%, while <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>. slipped 2.6%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">KB Home</span>'s results partly reflected strategic decisions that turned out badly for the builder, but data released Friday by the Commerce Department showed that sales of all new U.S. homes were weaker than expected in February. The data highlighted a major difference between the market for new homes and the market for existing homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The existing-home market, which showed signs of life this week when sales of previously owned homes reached their highest level since 2007, has been buoyed by investors who are buying distressed houses at bargain prices and renovating them for resale or rental. But the new-home market is still struggling to compete on price against foreclosures and short sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The new-home market is off way more from its peak than the existing-home market is, and the big difference is investors," said John Burns, a consultant based in Irvine, Calif., who tracks the national housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Angeles-based <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> posted a fiscal-first-quarter loss of $45.8 million, or 59 cents a share. While that was an improvement from the year-earlier quarter's $114.5 million loss, many analysts had expected the company to make much more progress toward profitability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More surprising, however, was KB's weak order book. Wall Street analysts had expected orders, which are a good indicator of the builders' future performance, to rise in the latest quarter, which ended Feb. 29.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead they fell 8% to 1,197 homes, with steep declines on the West Coast, which slumped 28%, and in the Southwest, which saw a 32% decline. The share of buyers who canceled their orders also worsened, rising to 36% from 29% a year earlier, meaning that more home sales are unraveling before they hit the closing table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results were "disastrous," said Stephen East, a home-building analyst with ISI Homebuilding Research. "In a recovering market, the results did an absolutely ugly U-Turn," he said in a client note. "We see not a single metric that gives us solace."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported sales of new homes fell 1.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 313,000 from January, the second straight monthly decline and the lowest reading since October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumers are not in lockstep with the builders. The builders are out there buying land, preparing to sell homes, but buyers lack the confidence to close on homes. And that lack of consumer confidence really affected the California builders in particular," says Steve Johnson a Southern California analyst for housing research firm Metrostudy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But industry watchers say some of <span class="companylink">KB Home</span>'s problems are company specific. While some builders have made significant headway in returning to profitability, <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> has spent much of the last two years buying land in foreclosure-plagued markets and pushing environmentally friendly houses that haven't yet proved popular with buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a conference call with analysts Friday, KB Home Chief Executive Jeffrey Mezger acknowledged that some markets have been sluggish despite positive signs in the national housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"California is the tale of two states, in that the coastal areas are performing well, in particular Southern California right now, where Orange County, L.A. County, San Diego County, our sales are strong, and if you go 50 miles inland it's very, very soft right now," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say KB also raised prices in some areas, which might have sent shoppers to competitors with lower prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">KB Home</span> executives also put part of the blame for the low orders and high cancellation rates on turmoil in the mortgage market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, <span class="companylink">MetLife Inc</span>., which had acted as the builder's preferred lending partner, announced it would shut down its nationwide mortgage operation. This caused some potential buyers to lose financing, KB said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Joseph De Avila   </div><div>1081 words</div><div>24 March 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A20</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to charming brownstone Brooklyn characteristics, Cobble Hill has pretty much got all the key requirements covered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tree-lined blocks? Check. Stately townhomes? Check. Highly regarded schools? Check.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also a tough place to buy a home. Over the past decade, Cobble Hill has become one of the most sought after neighborhoods in Brooklyn. The arrival of new families into the historically Italian-American community has been followed by scores of new restaurants, bars and boutiques.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Set south of Brooklyn Heights and north of Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill is a relatively tiny neighborhood made up of about two dozen city blocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Its a small little town next to Manhattan," said Ellen Gottlieb of <span class="companylink">Brooklyn Bridge Realty</span>, who has lived in Cobble Hill for nine years. "It stays small, and it stays quaint."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The name Cobble Hill was derived from Cobble Hill Fort from the Revolutionary War, which was situated where Atlantic and Pacific streets currently intersect with Court Street, according to the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Residential development primarily began in the 1830s, with rows of Greek Revival, Gothic Revival, Italianate-style homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, Cobble Hill's popularity has led it to becoming one of the most competitive neighborhoods in Brooklyn to buy residential property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are seeing bidding wars. Multiple offers is the norm for properly priced apartments," said Lori Mendelis of <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's been little new construction in the neighborhood since the recession, and that means inventory has been tight for both condos and rentals, Ms. Mendelis said. There's little to rent or buy and "when there is they go fast," she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current median asking price for Cobble Hill homes is $875,000 according to real-estate site StreetEasy. In Boerum Hill to the east it is $968,000 million, and in Brooklyn Heights to the north, it is $825,000 according to StreetEasy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asking prices for townhomes in Cobble Hill can range from $1.5 million up to $4 million, brokers say. But prospective buyers often can expect to pay above the asking price as closing prices for brownstones are approaching prerecession levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A four-level brownstone on Kane Street came on the market about two weeks ago for $1.875 million. More than a dozen offers have been made and most have been above the asking price, said Meryl Blackman of Halstead Property, who is marketing the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Landmark at Strong Place, one of the few condo projects in the neighborhood with new available units, is a converted English Gothic Revival church. It has 23 condo units, seven of which are still on the market for prices ranging from $895,000 to $2.175 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cobble Hill Towers also has condo units for sale. The project is made up of nine six-story buildings constructed in 1879. Prices there range from $269,000 to $510,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parks: Cobble Hill Park, about half an acre in size, is the neighborhood's main green space. It's a favorite among local families for its playground and central location. Also nearby at the waterfront is Brooklyn Bridge Park, which has a carousel, arts events and food vendors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schools: Cobble Hill public schools are in District 15. Schools in the district include P.S. 29 John Harrigan, P.S. 261 Philip Livingston and the Brooklyn Secondary School for Collaborative Studies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011, 66% of District 15 students received a proficient score on the math exam, and 54.9% of students received a proficient score on the English exam. In 2006, the results were 61% for math and 57% for English.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private schools nearby include the Brooklyn Heights Montessori School, running from prekindergarten through middle school and the Packer Collegiate Institute, running from prekindergarten through high school. There is also the International School of Brooklyn, which currently runs from prekindergarten through fifth grade. The school eventually plans to expand through eighth grade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Restaurants: Cobble Hill along with neighboring Carroll Gardens and Boerum Hill have developed into one of the premier destinations for dining in Brooklyn. Buttermilk Channel is one of the area's most popular restaurants and is famous for its fried chicken. 61 Local has an extensive selection of craft beers from New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shopping: Court and Smith streets are the main shopping corridors, with several small boutiques. There's also a <span class="companylink">Trader Joe's</span> and basic staples like hardware stores and pharmacies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entertainment: Cobble Hill Cinemas is a popular independent movie theater. Invisible Dog, an art gallery, is on Bergen Street. Cobble Hill is also a short walk to Littlefield, a performance and art space in Gowanus.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Dollar Slips on Poor Housing Data</span>
</div><div class="author">By Matthew Walter   </div><div>505 words</div><div>24 March 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar stumbled against the euro and yen, after a U.S. housing report cast doubt on the strength of the economic turnaround.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales in the U.S. fell for the second consecutive month in February, helping push the euro up to its highest level in three weeks in Friday trading. The greenback tumbled against the yen to below 82 yen for the first time since March 13 before regaining some ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. currency also touched its lowest level for the month against the Swiss franc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "relatively weak new-home sales numbers . . . made the market worry a little about the sustainability of the recovery," said Shahab Jalinoos, a currency strategist at <span class="companylink">UBS</span>. "Once the stock market gathered some steam, risk appetite in general recovered, and the dollar clawed back some of its losses."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late Friday in New York, the euro was at $1.3270 from $1.3201 late Thursday. The dollar was at 82.35 yen from 82.54 yen. The British pound bought $1.5869 from $1.5821. The dollar was at 0.9081 from 0.9134 late Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro also got a boost from encouraging news in France, where business confidence jumped this month and the government's statistics bureau late Thursday raised its forecast for the country's growth, suggesting the euro zone's second-biggest economy will avoid a recession this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The major currencies remained within their recent ranges for the week, as a mixed economic picture kept traders from placing aggressive foreign-exchange bets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets may remain quiet in the coming weeks ahead of April payrolls data in the U.S., which investors will look to for a clearer indication of the strength of the job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, improving U.S. economic data have helped boost bond yields, attracting investors to the dollar for much of the month. But the U.S. currency's gains against the yen stalled this week after Japan posted a trade surplus, leaving some analysts at odds over how much further the dollar can climb against the Japanese currency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greg Anderson, senior foreign-exchange strategist at Citibank, sees the dollar holding steady against the Japanese currency in coming weeks, but expects the yen to rebound later in the year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes in the U.S. fell for the second consecutive month in February, an indication that the housing market remains shaky in the aftermath of a severe bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales decreased by 1.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 313,000 from January, the Commerce Department said Friday. It was the second-straight monthly decline and the lowest reading since October 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results were worse than expected. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast sales last month would climb by 1.2% to an annual rate of 325,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, January's sales were revised downward to 318,000 from an initially reported 321,000. That was a decline of 5.4% from December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, new-home sales were up 11.4% compared with February 2011. And prices have stabilized: The median price of a new home was $233,700 last month, up 6.2% from February 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report on new-home sales came after reports earlier in the week had appeared to show that the housing market is stabilizing after a devastating crash in prices that started in summer 2006. But the market for new homes, in particular, remains week due to competition from foreclosures and other deeply discounted properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. dipped slightly last month, but still recorded the strongest February in five years. U.S. home building, meanwhile, fell in February, but permits for new construction reached their highest levels in nearly 3 1/2 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> on Monday reported its housing-market confidence index held steady at 28 in March after five straight months of gains. At the height of the building bubble, readings were in the high 60s and low 70s, well above the 50 reading considered positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market, which pulled the economy into the worst downturn since the Great Depression, remains shaky but has stopped being a drag on the overall economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though new home sales remain weak, investment in residential real-estate, including home building and renovation, has contributed to U.S. economic output for the past three quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of new homes listed for sale at the end of February, meanwhile, was 150,000, equal to January and the lowest on records dating to 1963. The supply would take 5.8 months to deplete at the current sales pace and is at a healthy level. The supply of unsold homes in January was 5.7 months. There were only 54,000 new homes completed in February, the lowest recorded level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report showed February's new-home sales were mixed across the country, when compared with a month earlier. They fell 7.2% in the South, 2.4% in the Midwest but rose 14.3% in the Northeast and 8.0% in the West.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy Stalls Springtime</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Property in China</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are green shoots in China's property sector. But the policy flamethrower could easily turn them back to scorched earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equity markets sold off Tuesday on gloom about China's growth. Comments from a top executive at Australian mining major <span class="companylink">BHP Billiton</span> on China's flattening demand pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average and <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index down. On Wednesday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng China Enterprises index followed, ending the day down 0.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reality of a secular slowdown in China's growth is difficult to dispute. What is harder to determine for the market is whether a resurgent property sector -- a key driver of China's economy -- could ride to the rescue of 2012 growth. There are bullish and bearish property signs competing for attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the bull side, daily and weekly data show sales volumes have picked up. Growth in property transactions in tier-one and major tier-two cities has moved into positive territory for the first time since the summer. Graeme Train, China commodities analyst at Macquarie, sees that as a positive but also notes the data need to be treated with caution. China's tier-one and -two cities got hit first by strict government controls. A year on, a low base flatters the growth rate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lisbon May Need to Make</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another Plan for Its Debt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now it is Lisbon's turn in the limelight. Portugal's five-year bond yields are stuck around 16%, where Greek bonds traded in April 2011, when euro-zone politicians started to insist private creditors should take losses. The flash point is a 9.7 billion euro ($12.84 billion) bond maturing in September 2013 that isn't covered by Portugal's 78 billion euros bailout. Until Lisbon explains where it will find the money, investors will fear a repeat of Greece's debt restructuring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vitor Gaspar, Portugal's finance minister, hopes rising confidence will allow it to return to markets in time to refinance the 2013 bond. Encouragingly, Portugal plans to sell 18-month Treasury bills later this year. And a new International Monetary Fund analysis will show Portugal's debt peaking three percentage points lower than previously forecast at 115% of gross domestic product in 2013, Mr. Gaspar says. That is comparable to Ireland's and below Italy's debt levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a gradual rise in confidence might not cut it, and T-bills alone can't plug the gap. Portugal will need to start issuing bonds well before September 2013; Ireland hopes to return to market this year to start refinancing a January 2014 maturity. The IMF usually wants to see funding available to cover the next year's needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That makes September 2012 a crunch point for Portugal, as March 2011 was for Greece. But the recession will make it difficult for investors to assess Portugal's ultimate debt sustainability, probably until the end of the year -- most likely after the decision on financing is needed. After all, Irish bond yields started falling only in mid-2011, after the country returned to growth and fixed its banking system. By contrast, Portugal has a long way to go on reforms and carries the added burden of three "junk" ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro zone has said it is ready to help if a country that is fulfilling its reform program can't return to market. But Portugal's leaders have said they won't ask for help. The country needs 25 billion euros-30 billion euros more to fund it to 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet it is in both sides' interests to address the concerns. From Portugal's perspective, a new funding deal might bring its return to market closer, as it would reassure markets that debt restructuring isn't the norm for the euro zone. And for the euro zone, funding Portugal for another two years would be a cheap price to pay to avoid a rerun of Greece's debt restructuring, which likely sparked an unnecessary recession.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GrainCorp Could Be</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next Big Harvest</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Glencore</span>'s $6.2 billion takeover of Canada's <span class="companylink">Viterra Inc</span>. is making rumblings Down Under.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Viterra</span> is dual-listed in Toronto and Sydney; it has an extensive Australian business and it has been actively expanding its footprint in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combined entity will marry <span class="companylink">Glencore</span>'s grain marketing and trading capabilities with <span class="companylink">Viterra</span>'s grain handling and processing assets in South Australia -- acquired when it bought ABB Grain in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tie-up gives <span class="companylink">Glencore</span> a bigger footprint from which to build its marketing business in Australia. But it isn't likely to change the game much for other grain handlers, given that these companies -- cooperative <span class="companylink">CBH Group</span> and publicly listed <span class="companylink">GrainCorp Ltd</span>. -- operate in different regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where the deal actually shines the spotlight is on GrainCorp., the last major publicly listed player in Australia's grain-handling industry. The company's shares got a lift out of the proposed deal, trading up more than 7.4% since <span class="companylink">Viterra</span> said it had been approached on March 9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The grain-handling industry has been the target of consolidation in recent years, and GrainCorp, which has a leading position in the eastern Australian markets of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, could be an attractive target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization rose 65% in the year to September 2011 and it expects as much as 8.6% growth in fiscal 2012. But recent years have seen extraordinary rainfall, and when the rains taper off, GrainCorp's earnings growth could, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Potential buyers may not be willing to spend as much as <span class="companylink">Glencore</span> is planning to pay for <span class="companylink">Viterra</span> -- around 11 times enterprise value to ebitda, according to RBS. GrainCorp is a much smaller business, RBS says, and the average transaction multiple in the market is around nine times, which would be "more appropriate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective buyers looking to sow their seeds in the Australian grain market should be careful not to overpay.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home building fell in February, but permits for new construction reached their highest levels in nearly 3½ years, reflecting housing's uneven and protracted recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction decreased 1.1% from January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 698,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of single-family homes, which makes up more than 70% of housing starts, fell by 9.9%—the largest drop in a year. Meanwhile, multifamily homes with at least two units, a volatile part of the market, posted a 21.1% gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, January's figures were raised to 706,000 starts overall, a 3.7% improvement from December and the highest level since October 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a positive sign for future construction, the February data showed new building permits rose by 5.1% from a month earlier to an annual rate of 717,000—also the highest level since October 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector has been healing slowly after prices collapsed more than five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> report on Monday showed that U.S. home builders' confidence in the market held steady in March at the highest level since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The level of activity still remains far short of the pace implied by the NAHB index so we look for further gains over the next few months in both sales and starts," said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. "Housing will add to growth all year, and beyond."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at MFR Inc., said that so far, the home builders association's level of confidence hasn't been matched by actual construction. "Our view remains that single-family housing starts are in a long-term bottoming process but that an enormous overhang of existing single-family home supply will prevent sharp gains in single-family starts in the near to medium term," Mr. Shapiro said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAHB said Monday that its members continue to face obstacles, including tight credit for both builders and buyers and a large inventory of inexpensive, foreclosed homes in many markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall economy seems to have perked up recently, adding more than 200,000 jobs in each of the past three months. As more Americans find jobs, that could bolster the housing market and spur construction—a sector that dwindled as a jobs engine during the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the nation's unemployment rate remains elevated at 8.3% and potential homebuyers have myriad choices among existing homes, which tend to be more affordable than newly built ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have started construction on about 1.5 million new homes a year, on average, since records started being kept in 1959. Last year, the industry started construction on only 609,000 homes, making 2011 among the weakest showings on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department data showed that housing starts were mixed across four U.S. regions. The Northeast posted a 12.3% decline, while starts in the West dropped 5.9% last month. Starts rose 3% in the Midwest and 1.5% in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actual housing starts, calculated without seasonal adjustments, grew to 48,100 in February from 46,500 in January. Lumber and commodities markets watch those numbers closely to gauge demand.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks fell as concerns about China's economic growth gave pause to a rally that pushed benchmarks to their highest levels in years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 66.86 points, or 0.5%, to 13172.27 in midday trading. If the red ink lasts throughout the day, the Dow industrials would record just their second loss in the last 10 sessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index declined 6.85 points, or 0.5%, to 1402.90, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 21.70 points, or 0.7%, to 3056.62.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth-sensitive energy and materials stocks like Caterpillar and <span class="companylink">United Technologies</span> led the market lower. They declined 2.4% and 1.5%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market declines came after an executive from <span class="companylink">BHP Billiton</span>, Australia's mining giant, warned that China's demand for iron ore will flatten as the world's second-largest economy cools. This year, China cut its 2012 gross-domestic-product growth target to 7.5%, an eight-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, China raised domestic gasoline and diesel prices for the second time this year, prompting concerns that higher prices could weigh on Chinese consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I do see a slowdown in China, but it's corporate fundamentals that are driving this market, and fundamentals are always going to butt heads with global risks," said Karyn Cavanaugh, market strategist at ING Investment Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts fell in February, but permits for new construction reached the highest level since 2008. Also, construction of single-family homes skidded 9.9% last month, the largest drop in a year, while multifamily homes posted a 21% gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data weighed on shares of home builders such as <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises</span>, down 5.2%, and <span class="companylink">Beazer Homes USA</span>, down 4.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tiffany jumped 6.2% after the luxury jewelry retailer's fiscal fourth-quarter results missed expectations, but its 2012 earnings and sales growth outlook topped projections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Jefferies Group</span> rose 1.4% after reporting its fiscal first-quarter profit easily topped analysts' estimates, with a boost from stronger than-expected fixed-income trading revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Adobe Systems</span> declined 4.3% after the company reported fiscal first-quarter results that were essentially in line with expectations, but said product sales, which represent the bulk of total revenue, declined from year-earlier levels and operating margins narrowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European Stocks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Car and resource stocks led losses amid those same worries about China.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders in part cited comments from an official from the Chinese Association of Automobile Manufacturers who said auto sales will miss its forecasts in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among individual car stocks, <span class="companylink">BMW</span> slid 5%, while <span class="companylink">Volkswagen</span> and Daimler each lost 4.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Basic-resource plays fell on the BHP remarks. <span class="companylink">Rio Tinto</span> declined 4.2% in London. Steelmaker <span class="companylink">ArcelorMittal</span> fell 3.6% in Amsterdam.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australian homeowners sidestepped the worst of the global financial crisis as the country's housing market held up well. But the party looks close to an end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the country's resource riches, the economy is faltering. Corporate profits are down, and unemployment is worsening. When commodity prices dropped in the fourth quarter, growth in gross domestic product disappointed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weakening conditions are flowing through to the property market.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing Market Creaks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Australia Wobbles</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australian homeowners sidestepped the worst of the global financial crisis as the country's housing market held up well. But the party looks close to an end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the country's resource riches, the economy is faltering. Corporate profits are down, and the unemployment rate is worsening. When commodity prices dropped in the fourth quarter, growth in gross domestic product disappointed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weakening conditions are flowing through to the property market. The volume of new home sales fell 7.3% in January to 11-year lows, according to the Housing Industry Association. New home loans are down nationwide, as are house prices in most of the capital cities of Australia's states. Worse could follow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>, the household debt-to-income ratio is around 150% -- higher than the ratio hit in the U.S. before the subprime mortgage crisis. Meanwhile, Australia's major banks have been forced to increase mortgage rates due to the higher cost of funding in global markets. Faced with a slowing economy and higher interest payments, Australians are surely more likely to pay down debt than borrow more to fund home purchases. Central-bank rate cuts could alleviate the pressure on households, but a few such moves late last year didn't do much to boost confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordability is already an issue. Homeowners are still paying their bills -- <span class="companylink">Commonwealth Bank of Australia</span> says the share of mortgages with payments more than 90 days overdue was 1.03% in the six months to Dec. 31. But Australian house prices are 6.7 times the median household income, more than double the level in the U.S., according to Lombard Street Research. A shock to the economy -- signals out of China spelling bad news for commodity prices, for instance -- could see borrowers coming under strain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last time the property market looked like it was getting in trouble, in 2008, the government boosted demand by ramping up grants for first-time buyers. These incentives have been scaled back, though Canberra could revive them if the housing market were to sink further. That could keep sales plodding along, but it would be a short-term fix only.</p>

<span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of India</span>'s</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hands Are Tied for Now</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India's central bankers could have taken the day off. The <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of India</span> said it left the key interest rate unchanged Thursday. It really has no other option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates in India are at decade-highs after a series of increases over the last two years meant to grapple with stubborn inflation. Recently, with the economy slowing and credit growth faltering, there have been calls for rate cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The RBI isn't convinced. It said that despite a recent moderation in headline inflation numbers -- the wholesale-price index was up 7% in February after running above 9% most of last year -- risks of prices rising again have increased. It pointed out two key risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the RBI says New Delhi's spending is offsetting its efforts to rein in price rises. The government increased its borrowing target from the market thrice this year and will borrow $113 billion, or 8% more, in the fiscal year starting in April. For the April-January period, the fiscal deficit was already close to $88 billion, more than 5% higher than the full-year target of $81 billion, the government said in an economic survey released Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A day before India discloses its federal budget, the RBI's decision to hold steady makes it clear the bank wants New Delhi to show restraint before starting to lower rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second concern is the jump in global crude-oil prices that could hit India hard, as the country imports most of its energy requirements. The rupee has recovered slightly from the plunge of late last year and is up 5.7% so far this year, but that isn't enough to cushion the rising cost of energy imports. Even though New Delhi doesn't pass on the cost of most fuels completely to retail buyers, it has moved to liberalize prices of some fuels, such as gasoline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is some pressure building for a cut down the line. Economic growth is slowing. The country's gross domestic product is expected to expand at 6.9% this year, sharply down from 8.4% in the previous year. The RBI may lower rates very gradually later this year. But for now, the focus remains on controlling prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Harsh Joshi</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Cheer for Ouster</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of China's Bo Xilai</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Give one cheer for the departure of Chongqing Communist Party chief Bo Xilai. A demagogue who threatened the status quo has been ousted, but the party system that has reasserted itself needs reform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bo shook up China's politics. The son of a founding father of the Communist Party, and a charismatic leader, he stood out among gray bureaucrats who run the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Chongqing, he achieved popularity and notoriety with a strongman style of leadership that harked back to the Mao era, and a crackdown against mafia-type corruption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other leaders sometimes appeared impotent in the face of corruption and unable to deliver basic public goods. Mr. Bo presented himself as an alternative, getting results even if he cut corners along the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now he has been ousted. On Thursday, state media announced Vice Premier Zhang Dejiang will succeed Mr. Bo as Chongqing party chief. Mr. Bo's campaign for a place on the Standing Committee of the Politburo, China's top political table, is almost certainly over. It isn't hard to see why he is gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His careerism -- he campaigned openly for a place on the Standing Committee -- upset the orderly process of leadership succession, shattering the facade of unity that leaders have maintained since Tiananmen. His antimafia campaign sparked controversy, with ruthless methods cutting against attempts to bring order to China's legal system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bureaucrats have reasserted themselves by kicking Mr. Bo out. But the system remains far from perfect. The rule of law is stymied by the refusal of the party to submit itself to the legal system. The pace of overhaul on the economy is glacial, and on governance, nonexistent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of that is bad news for China. Investors have started to demand a bigger premium for the risk of fraud at Chinese firms. Mr. Bo's case is a reminder that corruption, and political instability, are a risk at the country level as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for all the flaws with party rule, the alternative of rule by man was even worse. So give one cheer for Mr. Bo's departure, and reserve a second until something better comes along.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bidding war broke out in November when a small house in San Francisco's tightly packed Noe Valley came on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty-two people, including employees of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, <span class="companylink">Zynga</span>, <span class="companylink">Google</span> and Pixar, battled for the home. The winning offer was $1.5 million—40% higher than the asking price. The house had a great view, but it was only 1,800 square feet and came with an old kitchen which, like most of the interior, was covered in 1970s plywood paneling. Seen from the curb, there's hardly any house at all—just a one-car garage and gate leading to small front courtyard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inconspicuousness was part of the attraction, said Jasmin Arneja, 42, who bought the two-bedroom house with her husband Gagan, 40, a software engineer at a networking start-up. "It's the antithesis to these outrageous bizarre Gordon Gekko-esque houses. It just incorporates so much of our values," said Ms. Arneja, who runs a philanthropic advisory firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices in the San Francisco Bay area are once again soaring, thanks to an infusion of cash from the rising shares of Apple and <span class="companylink">Google</span> and the initial public offerings by <span class="companylink">Zynga</span>, LinkedIn, <span class="companylink">Yelp</span> and soon <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, expected to be the largest in Internet history. But while a previous generation of dot-com executives opted for mansions in wealthy San Francisco neighborhoods like Pacific Heights and tony Silicon Valley suburbs like Atherton, this generation is gravitating to modest homes and condos in grittier parts of the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ground zero of the current tech-fueled real-estate boom is the Mission, formerly a majority Hispanic neighborhood on the southern edge of San Francisco that's close to the main arteries that link San Francisco to Silicon Valley. Median home prices in the Mission grew 44% in December compared with a year earlier. Adjacent Noe Valley had a rise of 31% over that same period, according to the San Francisco Association of Realtors. The average number of days homes sat on the market in both neighborhoods has almost halved over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's in sharp contrast to what's happening nationally, where the housing market continues to flounder, with the Case-Shiller 20-City index down for the fourth straight month in a row. It's even an aberration from the San Francisco area (including Oakland), which saw a 5.4% drop in home prices in December from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents say it's a cultural shift. The new generation of Internet executives—younger than the last generation of dot-commers—eschews the trappings and responsibilities of expensive properties. They want to bicycle, walk or take public transportation. They like living near food trucks and dive bars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can spend a lot of money on a great restaurant here or just $5 on a burrito," said Christian Niles, 31, who bought a two-bedroom apartment for $585,000 in the Mission with his wife in August because he saw real estate as a good place to store the cash he'd made from selling his app called TrackerBot to Pivotal Labs last summer. He plans to never own a car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">StumbleUpon</span> CEO Garrett Camp bought a 2,900-square-foot loft penthouse with four bathrooms and a patio for $3 million this past summer in the South of Market area. Twitter co-founder Evan Williams bought a $2.4 million house in Noe Valley in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hottest properties are near corporate shuttle bus stops—where employees for companies like <span class="companylink">Google</span>, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, <span class="companylink">Genentech</span>, LinkedIn and Apple line up daily for the ride to Silicon Valley. Real-estate agent Amanda Jones calls it the "Shuttle Effect" and said proximity can command as much as a 20% premium. Some real-estate agents said they're dying for a map of where the buses pick up. "When a listing gets deluged with people—that tells me it's close to a stop," said Ms. Jones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some companies share a few of the same stops, occasionally leading to employees getting on the wrong bus. Discussions can get animated about adding or moving a stop, said Jessica Herrera, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s transportation coordinator who controls the stop locations for <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s eight shuttle busses, including a new glass-topped double-decker the company rented to make space for the growing crowds. "Everybody wants a stop that's next to their house that comes every five minutes," she said, adding that discussions have remained civil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephanie Pocino, 28, makes the 45-minute trip to <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> every day from her rented apartment building in the Mission. She has no garbage disposal and no dishwasher, but the Victorian building has lots of charm and bay windows. She carries a wireless Internet card, which she uses to answer emails and work on presentations while on the commute, and her laundry, which she gets done free at the company's headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soaring rental prices—up more than 10% in the Mission and Noe Valley in the past six months alone—are also making buying more competitive, said Vanguard Properties broker Craig Waddle. He's seen bidding competitions for rentals and rental offers coming in higher than the asking prices. At an open house for a one-bedroom offered for $1,400 a month, 40 people were filling out applications on the spot. One person walked up to the owner, offered $1,700 and got the place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's been kind of shocking," said Raj Gajwani, 36, who has been looking for a house in Noe Valley for around $1.5 million for the past few months. A founder of two online companies, he and his wife are expecting twins and want a house close to a shuttle-bus stop for his wife's commute but with "culture, interesting people and activities." They also want something they will be able to sell for more money in five years, when they might have to move to the suburbs for better schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Shaw, a real-estate agent who has worked for 15 years in the San Francisco market, said buyers often want something already renovated or vintage because they don't have the time or the interest to hire designers and architects. "That person in jeans and a sweatshirt could be low on the totem pole or a multibillionaire. They haven't realized the value of good design either in architecture or fashion," said Suzanne Tucker, a San Francisco designer who has remodeled many of the most lavish homes in the Bay Area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers argue they have a different sensibility. Ms. Arneja, who snagged the sought-after house in Noe Valley, said she was drawn to the interior, which is covered almost entirely by dark redwood and brick, lending it a feel that lands somewhere between a den and a tree house. "This is clearly a '70s house," said Ms. Arneja. "I would like to think of it as a shining example of good architecture during a bad period of design."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pop-up restaurants with long lines, coffee shops that brew one cup at a time and shops selling curiosities like local honey have followed the influx of cash. Apple employee Amandeep Jawa, who takes the company bus to work, covered the driveway of his Victorian with a "parklet," a public space registered with the city featuring seating and greenery. His crowning achievement: a topiary triceratops, dubbed Trixie, made of succulent plants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the gentrification is far from complete. A surge in violence between feuding gangs called the Norteños and Sureños claimed two lives in less than 24 hours in the Mission in August, and there was a shooting in front of a coffee shop. Noe Valley saw a rash of sexual assaults; residents there have also reported attempted carjackings and armed robberies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The key word is coexistence," said David Campos, a member of the city's Board of Supervisors representing the Mission and Bernal Heights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blogs popular with tech workers keep track of the violence, and one UC Berkeley student produced a map called "Gangs and Cupcakes," which overlaid Norteño and Sureño territory with the Mission's most popular cupcake cafes. In recent years, somebody spray-painted "cafe gentrification" on the sidewalk in front of popular coffee shops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high prices and the changes in the neighborhood are only going to intensify, predicted Lawrence Coburn, 42, who first moved to the Mission in 1999 to found a start-up and has lived in an 1,100-foot rental loft there since 2003. "A lot of my friends are trying to hustle to buy a place before all the <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> people get liquid," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investor Michael Barton, 48, recently decided to buy because he wanted to lock in his investment before <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s IPO money hits town. The area around his 950-square-foot, two-story loft is "kind of funky, and gritty and dodgy," said Mr. Barton. But an industrial building next door has been taken over by Internet start-ups. "You can tell there is an upsurge going on here," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOENIX—As home prices continue to drop in most cities, a nascent real-estate rebound here holds lessons for the rest of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This sprawling desert metropolis was one of the hardest hit housing markets during the bust. Phoenix home prices declined 55% from 2006 through the end of 2011, and Arizona's foreclosure rate jumped to No. 3 in the nation in 2009. Hundreds of thousands of homeowners are underwater, meaning they owe more than their homes are worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now real-estate economists across the country are studying an early but surprisingly broad Phoenix turnaround. The sharp drop in home prices has brought new buyers into the market. Unlike other markets where housing recoveries have been snuffed out by big overhangs of homes for sale and foreclosed properties, inventories are lean here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Phoenix has hit a bottom," says Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist who was one of the first to warn six years ago that prices in overbuilt metros were poised to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's hard-hit housing markets face a tough act: engineering a housing recovery without traditional trade-up buyers, many of whom are either unwilling or unable to sell because of huge price declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix has found a viable formula. Low prices are igniting demand from first-time buyers and investors who are converting the homes to rentals. The local economy is on the upswing with several big employers like <span class="companylink">Amazon.com Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Intel Corp</span>. hiring again, which is further increasing demand for housing. And the region is benefiting from a surge of buyers from Canada who are using their favorable exchange rate to scoop up bargains in the desert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local mom-and-pop investors are also playing key roles in soaking up supply. "I'm running my Realtor ragged looking at properties," said Robert Gerundo, who last month stood inside a two-bedroom condominium, scribbling his signature on an offer to buy the unit for $50,200, slightly above the listing price set by the bank, which recently foreclosed on the unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gerundo has bought 13 properties in Phoenix in the past two years and rents them out for as little as $950 a month. The 49-year-old, who drives around in a Jaguar with a Rutgers sticker on it, says he is making so much money as a landlord that he quit his job last year in New Jersey as a banker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, housing demand still remains weak and bank-owned sales are expected to rise this year, putting more pressure on prices. Many economists say they expect home prices nationally could fall by another 3% or so this year before hitting a bottom next year. Most expect that prices will rise little for several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices fell another 2% in the fourth quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index tracking 20 cities. But prices rose by 2% in Phoenix, the biggest increase of any metro area in the country. Over the past year, prices in Phoenix are down by 1.2%, the smallest drop since its prices started falling in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other markets are showing signs of life, too, as the spring buying season gets under way. Recent job gains for Detroit's auto sector have helped rev up sales in recent months. Home prices in Washington, D.C., have fared better than in much of the country thanks to better employment prospects from government-related hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big price drops, like those in Phoenix, are another key. In Detroit, prices are down by 46% over the past six years and have fallen to levels last seen in 1994. Sales have picked up in Miami, where prices are down by 51% over the past five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But low prices alone haven't been enough to so stabilize other epicenters of the housing bust where job growth still lags. In Las Vegas, where prices have tumbled 62% since 2006, including 8.9% over the past year, the local economy is heavily dependent on tourism and gambling, both industries that haven't recovered. "A lot of markets in the country have hit a bottom, but I just don't see them coming back the way Phoenix has," says John Burns, a homebuilding consultant in Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improving housing market in Phoenix isn't much comfort to anybody who bought a home there a few years ago. More than 52% of mortgage borrowers owe more than their homes are worth, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a real-estate data company. And not everyone in Phoenix is convinced that the improvements will last, especially if the economy falters or oil prices soar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix saw a small run-up in prices three years ago when federal tax credits spurred a buying frenzy, but prices dropped again once the credits expired. Others worry that banks have delayed foreclosures and will begin to saturate the market with more properties in the coming year. "It feels like a temporary bottom," says Brett Barry, a real-estate agent who lists properties for <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such concerns haven't discouraged buyers like Lloyd Sheiner from taking advantage of low prices to build an inventory of 143 homes, which he rents out to families that haven't been able to hold on to their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The panic is over," says Mr. Sheiner, an apartment and commercial real-estate investor who lives in Montreal and began buying 18 months ago after he concluded prices were too low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His average renter, he says, is a family of four with parents who have jobs. "They've been sitting around their kitchen table with a $350,000 mortgage on a house worth $140,000," he says. "And they're saying to themselves, 'Geez, what are we going to do? Do we spend the next 20 years of our life paying this down or do we start over?' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His company, Living Well Homes, has built its own property-management infrastructure that allows tenants to submit work orders online and automatically deducts rent from their checking account. "We don't go running around the valley banging on the door collecting rent," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Out-of-state buyers accounted for one-quarter of all purchases last month. One in every 25 sales went to a buyer that listed a Canadian address when registering the sale, according to the Cromford Report, a local real-estate publication. Many are flush with cash from a real-estate boom of their own in Canada and an exchange rate that has given Canadians unusual buying power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dean Selvey, a real-estate agent and investor who has built his business around marketing to Canadian snowbirds, last month set up a big booth at a two-day trade show in nearby Mesa called "Canadian Snowbird Extravaganza Celebration" that drew 5,000 attendees. "It's chase the Canadians—that's our market," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few days later, Jon Mirmelli, a local real-estate agent who has bought nearly a dozen foreclosures as rentals, knocked on the door of a homeowner whose home was slated for a bank foreclosure auction. After introducing himself and informing the occupant about the imminent foreclosure sale, he popped the question: "If you're not able to keep your house, would you be interested in renting it?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the porch, Mr. Mirmelli's business partner sized up the condition of the three-bedroom house, which the current owner bought for $150,000 in a short sale two years ago. At courthouse auctions, homes are sold as is, meaning the buyers may have to evict the former owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 29% of homes sold last month went to buyers who indicated they planned to rent out the properties, according to the Cromford Report. That figure has been on the rise over the past two years. In mid-2010, the share stood near 15%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition from investors is frustrating for aspiring first-time buyers like Adam Brenner. "This does not feel like a buyer's market at all," says Mr. Brenner, a pharmacist who estimates that he has looked at 60 houses since last fall. "You hear and read about how there are so many homes for sale, but once you start looking, it's a pretty big shock."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many real-estate agents have reported more bidding wars in recent weeks, and some buyers are agreeing to escalation clauses, a bubble-era provision where they agree to pay a certain price above the highest offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arizona makes it easier for banks to take back properties through foreclosure without going to court. The state saw the largest decline in the share of loans that were seriously delinquent or in foreclosure during 2011, according to Lender Processing Services. So-called judicial states such as Florida, where banks must process foreclosures by going through court, have seen growing backlogs, which some fear could eventually drag down Florida markets again in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now prices are firming up because fewer homes are selling out of foreclosure. Foreclosed properties accounted for 36% of all home resales in January, down from 55% one year ago and a peak of 66% in March 2009, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>, a real-estate data firm. Those declines have fallen, in part, because banks are also becoming more efficient at approving short sales, where it allows a sale for less than the mortgage debt owed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Orr, founder of the Cromford Report, says concerns that banks will begin to dump more foreclosures on the market are overblown, at least in Phoenix. "People think there's a glut of homes the banks are hiding somewhere, and that may be the case in other markets, but not here," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, a market recovery on paper means little to hundreds of thousands of underwater homeowners. Consider the case of Gil Monti. In just two days, he received five offers for this home—four above his asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that offers little comfort: He has been forced to sell the home, which he built 34 years ago and where he raised all three of his children, in a short sale for $275,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Monti was one of many people who refinanced his home repeatedly during the boom, pulling out cash along the way to fund home improvements and his kids' college educations. He paid $100,000 in construction and land costs in 1978, and the home was valued at nearly $600,000 in 2006. He sold the property last month in a short sale because his "interest only" $473,000 mortgage reset last year, requiring full interest and principal payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He realized the depth of his troubles last year when a neighbor sold a home for just $199,000, a third of what Mr. Monti's home was worth at the peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Monti isn't alone. "The recovery that gives people like Gil the freedom to sell their property is not going to happen, possibly ever, for a lot of people here," says Greg Markov, his real-estate agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Markov also represents Mr. Gerundo, the investor who bought 13 properties as rentals. "That recovery is already here" for Mr. Gerundo, Mr. Markov says. "His investment is not going down in value."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending eased 0.1% in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $827 billion in December, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Compared to January a year ago, construction spending was up 7.1%. The month-over-month decline in construction spending was due mainly to commercial construction, which fell 0.8% in January from December. Residential construction rose 1.6%. Compared to a year ago, commercial construction was up 7.9% in January while residential was up 5.4%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices fell to fresh lows in December, but economists say that a drop in the number of homes listed for sale could help stabilize prices in parts of the country this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices fell by 4% last year, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index that tracks 20 metro areas. Prices dropped by 1.1% for the three-month period ending in December compared with the same period ending in November.That was slightly better than November's reading, when prices were down 1.3% from October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's report is the latest evidence that the housing market still faces a cloudy outlook after a six-year downturn. The inventory of homes for sale has contracted, reducing competition among sellers, according to The Wall Street Journal's quarterly survey of housing-market conditions in 28 metro areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a large potential backlog of foreclosed properties hangs over many housing markets. Other headwinds including tight mortgage-lending standards that show few signs of easing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These are times of continued, great uncertainty about home prices," said Robert Shiller, the Yale University economist who co-founded the index that bears his name. "We might be on the verge of a home recovery, but then, maybe not."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others are becoming somewhat optimistic. Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist in Leesburg, Va., said the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index should hit a bottom this spring. He said many analysts have overlooked positive developments, including a dearth of new construction and the falling share of homes selling out of foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You don't hear very many people talk about the actual housing stock, and how slow it's growing," he said, while conceding that it is "absolutely true that organic demand has yet to show any material rebound."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when prices stop falling, they aren't likely to rise for years, leaving millions of homeowners stuck in properties worth less than what they owe. "We're looking at an L-shaped recovery," said Stan Humphries, chief economist at real-estate website Zillow, who predicts another 3.7% decline in home prices for the coming year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most of the country, home prices aren't falling at anywhere near their jaw-dropping pace of 2008. But only two markets showed an increase in home prices during the fourth quarter. In Phoenix, home prices were up by 0.8%, while Miami reported a smaller gain of 0.2%. Detroit was the only city to post a year-over-year gain, rising by 0.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in Atlanta, meanwhile, fell by 12.8% last year, while Chicago posted a 6.5% decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One surprising development in many housing markets is that the supply of homes for sale has fallen to a five-year low. While that normally would be a sign of health, real-estate agents say a paucity of homes is holding back sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Do you really want to take one of your biggest assets and sell it at the lowest value on record?" said Clark Wood, who leased out his four-bedroom home in Las Vegas late last year rather than sell it after he moved to Rockland, Calif., to take a better job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wood, 49, says he doesn't plan to sell the house until values recover, even if that means carrying two properties for five years or longer. The house is worth slightly more than the $260,000 he paid for it in 1998, and he has a small mortgage that he can cover with the rental income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales rate, it would take about four months to sell the supply of homes on the market in Denver, Washington, D.C., and Orange County, Calif. That level is lower, at less than three months, in Phoenix and San Francisco, and has dropped to just 1.9 months in Sacramento, Calif., according to figures compiled by John Burns Real Estate Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The TV and the papers make it seem like there's a ton of houses out there, but it's been a shock to us," said Andy Rysdam, 24, who is looking to buy his first home in Phoenix. He said he isn't worried about buying and then seeing prices tumble "because it doesn't seem like they can go much lower."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But several markets still face supply-demand imbalances that could keep pressure on prices. New York's Long Island had a 13-month supply of homes at the end of the fourth quarter. Nashville and Charlotte, N.C., had a 12-month supply, and northern New Jersey had a nearly 11-month supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those numbers will rise if banks sell more foreclosed properties as they correct deficient mortgage-handling practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories also could rise if more sellers follow in the footsteps of Ian Flatt. In December, he listed his Las Vegas home and soon will ask the bank to agree to sell it for less than what he owes in what's known as a short sale. For the past year, Mr. Flatt had been renting out the property—at a $1,200 monthly loss—after he moved to Southern California to take a better job in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It didn't seem to make sense to send good money after bad," said the 38-year-old human-resources consultant. The home is listed for about $130,000, or half what he paid for it in April 2008.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best that can be said about the latest Congressional attempt to heal the housing market is that politicians have at least diagnosed a real problem: a glut of homes for sale. Like other proposed top-down fixes, however, the latest Beltway brainstorm would likely hurt more than help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Scott Brown and Democrat Sherrod Brown want to speed up short sales, which occur when a lender agrees to let a homeowner pay off a mortgage by selling a home at a price below the outstanding loan balance. Their bill—introduced earlier this month—would force lenders to approve or deny short-sale offers within 75 days or face a $1,000 fine, plus attorneys' fees. The lender could ask for an extension only once, for 21 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accelerating short sales isn't a bad idea, in and of itself. Delinquent borrowers can offload their mortgage and find another home they can afford, or move to an area that's cheaper. Lenders don't have to endure a lengthy foreclosure process and risk having the property sit unoccupied for months, if not years. Borrowers who can afford the home can snap them up at bargain prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But why do the Senators want to interfere in a market that is working? <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> recorded 293,574 short sales last year, up from 273,100 in 2010 and 64,813 in 2007. That makes sense: Lenders want to minimize their losses as best they can and are working through their portfolio as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Setting an arbitrary timeline for short sales makes for a good political talking point, but it might have unintended consequences. Lenders often have to coordinate with investors and second-lien holders to approve the deal, which takes time. They also don't want to rush, make a mistake and expose themselves to litigation for sloppy paperwork, especially after the recent furor over alleged "robo-signing" abuses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fraud is another concern, though it's hard to get firm estimates on the extent of the problem. Risk consultancy Interthinx estimates about $1 billion was lost annually in deals between 2007 and 2010 when buyers resold property for more than 20% of the original sale value within six weeks—a red flag for fraud in a market with falling or flat home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes a broker's low-ball assessment done on a house is fraudulent; sometimes a broker conceals from the lender the fact that a willing buyer exists for the house at a higher price. Big banks like <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> or <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> can devote resources to fighting this kind of fraud but smaller lenders may not have the same capabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Try as Congress might, there's no quick fix to the oversupply of homes that's weighing down the housing market. Increasing the regulatory burden on lenders will only prolong the pain.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index that tracks contracts to buy previously owned homes rose 2% in January from December to the highest level since April 2010, rekindling hopes that improving demand will help halt the slide in prices this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index of pending home sales, which reflects deals that have signed contracts but haven't yet closed, rose to 97 from 89.8 a year ago, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reading was the highest for any January since 2007, but still remains at historically low levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate firms saw buyer traffic surge as the year began, "but we don't yet know if they're going to buy," said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of brokerage <span class="companylink">Redfin Corp</span>. "Part of the concern is that we saw a strong January and February last year," only to see sales disappoint during the spring and summer, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other reasons for caution: Many real-estate agents say a significant share of contracts are falling apart at the closing table. Also, lending standards remain tight, so some buyers can't qualify for loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bigger problem is that appraised values often come in below the agreed-upon sales price, forcing the buyer to lower the price or the seller to make a larger down payment in order to hold the deal together, real-estate agents say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, while mortgage rates are nearly one percentage point below their levels of a year ago, applications for home-purchase mortgages remain in the dumps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications were down by 10% from a year ago in mid-February, according to an index maintained by the Mortgage Bankers Association, recording their second-lowest weekly level since the housing downturn began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some housing analysts say a pickup in sales might not be detected by the mortgage index because investors and other all-cash buyers have played a growing role in many of the hardest-hit housing markets over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers have stepped up efforts in recent weeks to shore up battered housing markets. On Monday, for example, the regulator that oversees <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> said it would begin accepting bids from investors on about 2,500 properties in eight different regions as part of an initiative announced last year to convert some foreclosed properties into rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those properties are now occupied by renters, and under the program, investors would be required to maintain them as rentals. If this first phase succeeds, Fannie could begin marketing other foreclosed properties this way. So far, it has largely resisted bulk sales, instead selling homes one at a time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 23% of the units in the first phase of the program are in Southern California, and 21% are in Atlanta. Other markets where Fannie is soliciting investor interest include Chicago, Las Vegas, Phoenix and three different regions in Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't clear how the sales would be structured. It is possible Fannie would keep a stake in a joint venture so the housing-finance company would benefit if home values rise. Policy makers have encouraged federal entities to consider renting out foreclosures because many housing markets are seeing rents climb while prices remain under pressure from a glut of foreclosed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> began "pre-qualifying" investors this month, and the regulator said in a statement on Monday that investors would have to go through a "rigorous" process to be eligible to bid on the properties. It didn't specify a timeline for the auctions, but initial sales could take place over the course of several months, people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, federal officials on Monday said they would increase mortgage fees charged by the Federal Housing Administration to borrowers who take out loans insured by the agency. Today, the FHA offers among the easiest lending terms available, with down payments of just 3.5%, making it popular with first-time buyers. But the value of its reserves has plunged, raising the specter of a taxpayer bailout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beginning April 1, the agency will raise by 0.75 percentage point to 1.75% the upfront insurance premiums that borrowers must pay when they take out FHA-backed loans. On a $300,000 loan, the new upfront premium works out to $5,250, up from $3,000. Because homebuyers are allowed to roll those fees into their loan, officials said they expected the higher premiums wouldn't deter many buyers.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of new homes fell in January as more Americans bought previously owned property amid an uncertain economic climate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales dropped 0.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 321,000 from December, the Commerce Department said Friday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires forecast sales last month would climb 2.6% to an annual rate of 315,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline was the first in five months. December sales rose 1.9% to 324,000, which was the highest of the year; originally the Commerce Department estimated sales that month fell 2.2% to 307,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year over year, new-home sales were up 3.5% from January 2011. A report this week showed sales of previously occupied homes in the U.S. rose last month to the highest level in more than a year and a half. Used homes tend to be cheaper than new ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report Friday showed the median price of a new home was $217,100 last month, down 9.6% from January 2011. While a drop in prices makes homes more affordable, it also has a bad side. Many people have a significant part of their net worth in their homes, and declining home values make them feel less wealthy—and less inclined to spend money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending is a big engine for growth. The economy is expected to rise this year, but only modestly, with unemployment remaining high. In addition, uncertainty lurks over the sovereign-debt crisis in Europe and the debate in the U.S. over fiscal policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the housing sector to recover, the economy needs to create more jobs and housing prices must stabilize. But economists think prices will keep falling because the foreclosure pipeline is long. Falling prices pull more homes "underwater," which means the owners owe more on their mortgages than their properties are worth. That leads to more foreclosures and lower prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With builders pessimistic, the number of new homes listed for sale at the end of January was 151,000, a record low. The supply would take 5.6 months to deplete at the current sales pace and is at a healthy level. The supply of unsold homes in December was 5.7 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce report showed January new-home sales were mixed across the country, rising 11.1% in the Northeast and 9.3% in the South while dropping 24.5% in the Midwest and 10.6% in the West.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. rose last month to the highest level in nearly two years, and the inventory of unsold homes contracted to a level considered healthy by economists, positive signs for the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales increased 4.3% in January from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.57 million, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. It was the third increase in the past four months and the highest level of sales since May 2010, when the housing market was lifted by federal tax credits. Compared with January a year ago, sales rose 0.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists were generally encouraged by the report, which comes amid other signs that the housing market may have bottomed and is starting to heal. "We're slowly improving for the right reasons: more jobs, more credit availability and affordability of homes," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist with <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guy Berger, U.S. economist with RBS Capital Markets, wrote that some of the recent growth in home sales may have been the result of the mild winter. "But for the most part, it seems that the housing sector may have turned the corner," he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists, however, said January's report wasn't as encouraging as it appeared because the size of the gain was due to a large downward revision in December's data. The revised reading for December was 4.38 million compared with an earlier estimate of 4.61 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The number of sales in January was actually a touch lower than we had thought they were in December," wrote Paul Diggle, property economist at Capital Economics. Nevertheless, he said, "it's still the case that existing home sales are recovering, albeit only gradually."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month's median sales price was $154,700, down 2% from $157,900 a year earlier. The inventory of previously owned homes listed for sale fell to 2.31 million at the end of January, the lowest level since March 2005. That represented a 6.1-month supply at the current sales pace, a level economists consider healthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' report said home sales rose last month from a month earlier in all four U.S. regions. Sales were up 8.8% in the West, 3.5% in the South, 3.4% in the Northeast and 1.0% in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been one of the weakest parts of the U.S. economy, but there are signs it is starting to recover after a price collapse that began 5½ years ago. In 2011, about 4.26 million homes were sold, up 1.7% from 4.19 million in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates have been hovering around the lowest recorded levels and hiring has picked up, giving some buyers more confidence. However, prices in many distressed markets have continued to fall due to a continuing flow of foreclosures. While the share of loans in foreclosure has remained elevated, the number of new borrowers falling behind on their mortgages has been declining.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall home prices in the Bay Area haven't hit bottom but soon will, according to a new forecast. The area including San Francisco, San Mateo and Redwood City is expected to see home prices drop to their lowest point in the second quarter of this year, sooner than parts of the Bay Area, according to the Case-Shiller index of housing prices, which tracks the change in prices but doesn't publish underlying home-price figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the region covering Oakland, Fremont and Hayward should hit bottom in the fourth quarter of 2012, followed by the area including San Jose, Sunnyvale and Santa Clara in the first quarter of 2013, the index predicts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year after hitting their respective bottoms, all three of the regions are forecast to see a sharp rise in house prices: 6% in the San Francisco area, 5% in Oakland and 8% in San Jose, according to the index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index doesn't track subsets of these markets, masking what have been bounces in prices in some towns and communities, with the core Silicon Valley cities of Menlo Park, Palo Alto and others having experienced increases in median home sale prices last year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooklyn may be the new urban suburb, but developers are catching on late to the borough's family values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Williamsburg, where tattooed moms and mustachioed dads trailed by toddlers are an increasingly common sight, the area is suffering from a shortage of family-size apartments with three bedrooms or more. Just 13% of the for-sale housing inventory in Williamsburg is 1,500 square feet or larger, according to MNS, a real-estate company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In downtown Brooklyn and Fort Greene, just 7% of apartments are larger than 1,500 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compare that with the Upper West Side, where nearly two-thirds of the inventory is larger than 1,500 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The squeeze on family-size apartments comes after a building boom in Williamsburg and downtown Brooklyn, where towers such as the Edge and Toren rose high into the sky. Some developers now acknowledge they failed to fully anticipate the coming explosion of young families and were betting instead on young singles seeking solo pads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When we started developing, Williamsburg was pretty much recognized as a creative community -- artists, musicians, galleries, cafes, vintage clothing. As time passed, years turned hipsters into parents," said Jeffrey Levine, of Douglaston Development, which built the Edge, with its 565 market-rate condos on the Williamsburg waterfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market is starting to correct itself, slowly. For instance, about 5% of the units in the Edge are three-bedrooms, but Mr. Levine said it will be 10% in his next condo project on a neighboring lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, young parents said they are making do in smaller apartments while fruitlessly scouring the market for an apartment big enough to fit their growing families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Katy Pymm, a 31-year-old Pilates instructor with an infant son and another child on the way, rents a small two-bedroom apartment in Williamsburg with her husband and has been searching for a larger space for three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Pymm said they've seen almost nothing that fits their soon-to-be family of four. "We've looked at everything -- new condos, older buildings, loft-style. There are a few three-bedrooms, but they tend to go quickly," Ms. Pymm said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite their problems finding an apartment, she said they won't consider leaving because other neighborhoods lack Williamsburg's restaurants and sense of place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple's broker, Mary Crocker, of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said she has seen this with other clients as well. Families started moving in about four years ago, she said, and since then "there's been kind of a snowball effect."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, Brooklyn is experiencing a condo development crunch overall, with fewer buildings being built after a slew of projects converted to rentals. The number of listings for three-bedroom or larger apartments in new developments has fallen 35% in Williamsburg and 9% in Brooklyn in the last year, according to StreetEasy.com. Meanwhile, the number of such units in Manhattan has remained basically stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a classic Brooklyn twist, some couples are even putting apartment planning ahead of family planning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Katie Reimer, 32 years old, said she and her husband own their 2-bedroom condominium on North 10th Street between Bedford and Berry streets but are looking for more room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Reimer gave birth to her first child six months ago. "We had the baby unplanned," she said. "And now we're thinking about growing our family." She said they might wait to have a second child until they find a suitable home. "It doesn't seem like there are many options," said Ms. Reimer, a schoolteacher. "It would be nice to live by the river and have more space," she said. So far, they've only looked at a few units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers are often loath to gamble on larger units, especially in neighborhoods that are considered up-and-coming. A $1 million three-bedroom unit that doesn't sell is a much greater liability than a smaller unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few developers that gambled on larger units are seeing those bets pay off. At 144 North Eighth St., formerly nicknamed Williamsburg's "Finger Building," GFI Development Co. altered layouts of the units on the top four floors to help create three-bedroom units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a bit of a gamble," said Steven Hurwitz, a vice president at GFI. "We always thought that down the road, as the market matured, it will go from smaller units where singles were buying, to a bigger market where people would be buying larger units."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of workers filing new applications for unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level in nearly four years, one of a series of reports offering mostly positive signs about the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial unemployment claims dropped by 13,000 to 348,000 in the week ended Feb. 11, the Labor Department said Thursday. The decline in the weekly report was the third in a row and carried new jobless claims to their lowest level since early March 2008, before the financial crisis broke out that year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, home building rose slightly in January, but not enough to signal that the housing industry is ready to recover from the worst downturn in decades. Meanwhile, wholesale prices rose only modestly in January, as energy and food costs declined, but underlying prices jumped by a larger amount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing starts and unemployment claims numbers add to the belief that the economy is shifting gears," said economist Joel Naroff, of Naroff Economic Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The positive reports are likely to fuel a continuing debate among <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> policy makers about whether to engage in a new round of bond-buying to aid an economy that is growing only modestly more than two years after the end of a deep recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minutes released Wednesday of the central bank's January meeting showed officials appeared divided over more bond purchases, which would seek to spur investment by pushing down long-term interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, the government reported nonfarm employment rose by 243,000 jobs in January, the biggest gain in nine months. as the unemployment rate fell to 8.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's report on the prices producers pay for goods and services showed an overall increase of only 0.1% in January. But core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy, rose a heftier 0.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jump in core inflation could reflect start-of-the-year increases in prices of drugs and other goods rather than an accelerating trend, said Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">January housing starts rose 1.5% from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 699,000, up almost 10% from a year earlier, the Commerce Department said. That figure was helped by an 8.5% increase in multifamily-home starts, a volatile part of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of single-family homes, which made up about 73% of housing starts, fell by 1% on a monthly basis, though it was still up by more than 16% from the same month a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home builders are shaking off the shackles of the last five years and are beginning to contribute to [economic] growth," said Paul Dales, an economist with Capital Economics. "That said, the housing sector is currently not big enough to set the economy alight."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an encouraging sign, the share of homeowners behind on their mortgage hit the lowest level in three years in the fourth quarter of 2011, a report said Thursday. But the share of loans in foreclosure remained near the highest levels of the housing crisis, meaning the sector could face continued pressure as banks take over and resell homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey by the Mortgage Bankers Association showed 7.6% of residential mortgages were at least 30 days past due at the end of 2011, against 8.3% a year ago.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks rose Thursday as positive news from the labor and housing markets deflected concern about Greece's debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 110.65 points, or 0.9%, to 12891.60 in midday trade. Blue chips rebounded after falling 97 points on Wednesday, the Dow's worst session of the year. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index rose 0.9% to 1354.79, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1% to 2944.52.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All 10 sectors in the S&amp;P 500 rose, as utility and financial stocks led the advance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks rose early after a full slate of U.S. economic data encouraged investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of U.S. workers applying for unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level in nearly four years. Initial claims dropped by 13,000 to 348,000 last week. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expected claims to rise by 7,000, to a total of 365,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts increased to an adjusted annual rate of 699,000 last month, while economists had expected starts to total 677,000. Issuance of building permits for housing rose 0.7% in January, in line with expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The trend in jobless claims has been encouraging, and on the whole the data has been firmer in the recent months," said Josh Feinman, global chief economist for DB Advisors in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wholesale prices rose modestly in January. The producer-price index climbed a seasonally adjusted 0.1%, shy of the expected 0.4% rise. But core prices, which exclude energy and food, rose 0.4% versus an expected 0.2% rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Philadelphia Fed reported that an index of business conditions for manufacturers in the mid-Atlantic region rose to 10.2 in February from 7.3 in January, slightly better than expectations for a reading of 10.0.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downgrade fears fanned more euro-zone worries. Moody's Investors Service placed the ratings of more than 100 European financial institutions and 16 European countries on review for possible downgrade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In corporate news, General Motors rose 6% after the auto maker reported a record profit of $7.6 billion for 2011, but also losses in Europe and thin profit margins in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span> fell 4.3% after analysts at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> trimmed the stock's rating to "equalweight" from "overweight," warning that Apple's iPhones and iPads sales could take away market share in electronic books. The stock fell even after a report from <span class="companylink">IHS Inc</span>. showed Amazon's Kindle fire and other low-priced tablets cut into Apple's market share in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European Stocks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares declined as investors digested conflicting information about whether Greece will get its 130 billion euros loan tranche before its March 20 bond redemption payment becomes due. <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> warning about possible bank downgrades also hit sentiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index closed 0.1% lower at 5885.38. Germany's DAX fell 0.1% to 6751.96 and France's CAC-40 closed 0.1% higher at 3393.25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stoxx Europe 600 index slumped heavily in the last minute of trading to close down 10% at 236.90, but traders attributed this fall to a technical glitch or what is known as a "fat finger" or input error. Index specialist <span class="companylink">Stoxx Limited</span> was unavailable to confirm this. The blue-chip Euro Stoxx 50 index ended down 0.2% at 2489.35.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks suffered the brunt of the selling.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Surge in Chinese Stocks Looks Vulnerable</span>
</div><div class="author">By Tom Orlik   </div><div>396 words</div><div>16 February 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C12</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The party for China's equities might be over before it even has begun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Shanghai market has risen 7.6% so far in 2012, after a 22% drop during 2011. The surge was supported by bullish assumptions about the direction of policy on bank lending and home sales. Now that those assumptions are starting to come unstuck, the market's recent run looks unsustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On property, investors were cheered last Thursday when Wuhu, a town in eastern China, broke ranks from the two-year national clampdown on house prices and announced subsidies for home buyers. But on Saturday, with Beijing smarting, Wuhu made an abrupt about-face. The central case remains one where controls on the property sector remain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is bad news for equities. Slower property sales will dent earnings at developers, steel and cement firms that populate the mainland index. Flat or falling house prices might encourage investors to favor equities. But analysts at CLSA say any substitution effect is less powerful than the negative wealth effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expectations that more ample credit would find its way into the stock markets also have faded. New loans for January came in at a pitiful 738.1 billion yuan ($117.2 billion), down 22.9% from a year earlier. Reports in the official media suggest February's new loans also are subdued -- further evidence the new loan quota for the year will be below the 8 trillion to 8.5 trillion yuan markets had hoped for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rapid growth of wealth-management products also will dent demand for equities. In the past, investors wanting to beat inflation had little choice but to risk a ride on the stock-market roller coaster. Wealth-management products provide another option, offering higher returns than bank deposits without the palpitations of equities. China's wealth-management products typically invest in money markets, or high-interest loans, not stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As demand for equities falls, supply might be set to increase. <span class="companylink">Ernst &amp; Young</span> says initial public offerings on the mainland could reach 300 billion yuan in 2012, up about 10% from 2011. With reduced demand chasing increased supply, the minirally in China's equity markets in the first weeks of the year looks difficult to sustain.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown </div><div>949 words</div><div>13 February 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOSTON -- This city is finally preparing to heal a hole in its heart: the site of the former Filene's flagship department store that for more than three years has been a stalled real-estate development in the center of downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A New York developer, <span class="companylink">Millennium Partners</span>, has agreed to buy a controlling stake in the long-delayed project with new plans for developing a mixed-use tower, the city announced earlier this month. If finalized, the deal would bring to an end a high-profile war waged by Boston Mayor Thomas Menino against <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span>, which has controlled the site for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A five-term mayor, Mr. Menino tried for two years to publicly bully Vornado into restarting its planned project, a 39-story hotel-office-apartment tower that was halted in the middle of excavation as the economy soured. He called the developer arrogant, threatened to use eminent domain and revoked its permits to build.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's my fiduciary responsibility to make sure a property like that gets redeveloped as quickly as possible," Mr. Menino said in an interview at City Hall. "You're not going to hold up the city of Boston."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Menino said he met recently with Vornado, one of the country's largest owners of office and retail property, and they agreed the company and city would start a new chapter. Vornado had previously said the drop in property values and the economy meant it couldn't restart the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the Millennium agreement, Vornado would keep a noncontrolling stake in the project, according to the mayor's office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millennium declined to go into detail about its plans, saying in an emailed statement that it "will design and construct a building worthy of the site's significance and prominence."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Menino's aggressive approach comes at a time when similar stalled sites dot cities across the U.S., a vestige of the real-estate boom turned bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has pledged tax abatements to developers in an attempt to complete the Revel casino in Atlantic City and a stalled $1.8 billion retail and entertainment center previously named Xanadu in the Meadowlands outside Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, an array of government agencies in 2010 pledged hundreds of millions of dollars to aid completion of one to two privately owned office towers at the World Trade Center site, depending on how much space is leased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other cities, meanwhile, have taken a more laissez faire approach such as Chicago, where prominent development sites have remained boarded up, including a giant circular foundation along Lake Shore Drive that was to house what would have been the tallest tower in the U.S. at 2,000 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Boston, frustrations over the halted Vornado project resonated throughout the city. Ire over the pit has been the subject of numerous editorials in both of Boston's daily papers. The stalled site was the main focus of an environmental design class at Northeastern University last fall, and earlier this year, the City Council president, Stephen Murphy, sought to block an unrelated casino project in which Vornado was an investor until the company made progress downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such frustrations speak to the nostalgia some Bostonians have for their compact downtown and its rich history. The pit was the site of part of the flagship Filene's Department Store and Filene's Basement, a discount-shopping institution in the center of a once-vibrant shopping district called Downtown Crossing. Both Filene's and Filene's Basement have gone out of business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exterior of the oldest portion of Filene's still stands, protected by a historic-preservation designation but awaiting a new use. A <span class="companylink">Macy's</span> operates across the street in what for decades was Jordan Marsh, Filene's arch rival, while numerous smaller stores draw shoppers past the hole in the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area declined through the past half-century, and in recent years, the Menino administration made its revitalization a priority. The planned office, condo and retail project was to be the centerpiece. Instead, after Vornado stopped construction in 2008, the pit left more blight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a key part of the rejuvenation of the area," said Jerold Kayden, an urban planning professor at Harvard University. "To have a hole there is devastating."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the start of new construction is by no means a fait accompli. Millennium hasn't yet completed its deal, which involves acquiring the stakes of Vornado's current partners -- a fund managed by <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>., <span class="companylink">Mack-Cali Realty Corp</span>. and Boston Global Investors -- and putting in an unspecified amount of new money, according to the Boston Redevelopment Authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a tough time to get construction financing for any project, one of the reasons it has taken so long for Vornado to bring in a new partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The redevelopment authority said it believes Millennium will be able to start work within a year, and that it enjoys a good relationship with the company, a major developer in New York and Boston that recently started work on an apartment building nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the deal is still a work in progress, it appears the mayor's public pressure has sped up the process of luring a new partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It had an impact," said John Hynes III, chief executive of Boston Global investors, a minority investor in the project that is getting bought out. The city, he said, "wanted to create a sense of urgency and impatience to get this fixed, and that message was loud and clear."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kristina Peterson and Jeffrey Sparshott   </div><div>644 words</div><div>11 February 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ORLANDO—Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke called Friday for new policies to help the nation's weak housing market, calling it a significant factor holding back the economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to continue to develop and implement policies that will help the housing sector get back on its feet," Mr. Bernanke said at a National Association of Homebuilders conference in Orlando, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed chairman said the problems in the housing market—including sunken real estate values, depressed home construction and barriers to mortgage refinancing—were hurting the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The state of the housing sector has been a key impediment to a faster recovery," Mr. Bernanke said. That pressure wasn't likely to lift soon, he said, predicting that the high rate of foreclosures was "likely to continue for a while," keeping down housing prices and putting a strain on communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have fallen by almost a third over more than five years. Nearly 1.9 million homes have gone through into foreclosure in the past two years, and just as many are in the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke's comments are the latest from the central bank calling for more action on housing. Last month, the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> sent a paper to top lawmakers warning that tight mortgage-lending standards threaten to hold back the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Fed</span> paper, and similar comments by other <span class="companylink">Fed</span> officials, drew rebukes from some Republicans, who told the central bankers not to meddle in matters best left to Congress. On Friday, Mr. Bernanke said the paper wasn't meant to "come down with a specific set of recommendations" but rather to "put out there the main issues and arguments" and to draw attention to housing's role in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed chairman's remarks Friday came a day after an announcement by government officials of a $25 billion settlement over alleged foreclosure abuses that will, in part, offer reductions in loan principal to some home owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke acknowledged the efforts to prevent foreclosures, but said some home owners simply wouldn't be able to afford monthly payments even with substantial loan modifications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the Fed chairman focused on other possible tools to aid a housing recovery, including putting homes that have been foreclosed and are now creditor-owned on the market as rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With home prices falling and rents rising, it could make sense in some markets to turn some of the foreclosed homes into rental properties," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Mr. Bernanke said the central bank was "intensely focused" on improving credit conditions. While some tightening of credit was to be expected in the wake of the financial crisis, "the pendulum has probably swung too far in the other direction by this time," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed chairman faced a question from a New York real-estate investor who complained that banks won't extend more than four mortgages because of certain rules put in place by investors and banks. In 2008, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the main funders of mortgages, faced soaring losses from speculators and reduced to four, from 10, the number of loans they would guarantee to any one owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie now backs as many as 10 loans, but some banks have kept lower limits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those policies can be "actually pretty counterproductive," Mr. Bernanke said, suggesting they could hinder investors willing to help converting homes owned by creditors into rental properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have all these homes on the market...investors out there would like to buy them and manage them and resell them, fix them up—what's wrong with that?" he said. "We'd like to see more of that happening."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jim Carlton   </div><div>960 words</div><div>9 February 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current technology boom has rippled out into the housing markets in Silicon Valley's core towns, but the ripples aren't reaching much beyond that, as home values fell at the end of last year in a majority of the Bay Area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median prices on existing, single-family homes rose in only 29 of 102 cities or communities around the region in the fourth quarter, compared with a year earlier, while prices declined in 72 areas, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>, a real-estate data firm in La Jolla, Calif. Glen Ellen dropped the most, at 33.5%, while one community, Brentwood, stayed flat in the quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew LePage, a <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> analyst, cautioned that the price swings in some communities were partly due to a shifting mix of homes sold and a lower number of transactions in some cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. LePage attributed the price declines in some towns partly to the expiration in 2010 of a federal tax credit for some home buyers. He says that credit, passed by Congress in 2008, had helped stimulate demand at the lower end of the market. Tight lending standards for jumbo mortgage loans are hurting the higher end of the market, and a tepid economic recovery outside the tech sector is dragging down both the high and low ends, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All those factors could continue to hold back a full-on housing recovery, despite the pockets of high demand in Silicon Valley, Mr. LePage says. "Barring some shock to the economy, it looks like for most of the Bay Area—and California—the most you can expect we will find is a convincing rock bottom for prices in 2012," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In communities in the shadow of tech giants like <span class="companylink">Facebook Inc</span>. in Menlo Park, housing prices are on a tear. Menlo Park led the Bay Area with a 52.7% increase in its median home sales price in the fourth quarter, with prices rising to $1.29 million from $840,000 a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>. Palo Alto's median home-sales price jumped 12.5% to $1.1 million from $977,750, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities outside of Silicon Valley didn't fare as well. Sonoma, for example, experienced a 24.1% drop in the fourth quarter in its median home-sales price to $356,000 from $469,000 a year ago, while Walnut Creek prices fell 18.3% to $580,000 from $709,500, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a positive sign for the housing market, some brokers say they are busier than they have been in years. In 2011, the Los Gatos-based Sereno Group, a real-estate brokerage, sold 1,015 homes in Silicon Valley for a total of $1.01 billion, up 16% from the 875 homes valued at $800 million it sold in 2010, says Christine Perry, a founding partner in the firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It started with Palo Alto and is spilling over into other communities," Ms. Perry says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dick Keenly experienced that boom firsthand. The 76-year-old retired tech entrepreneur listed his three-bedroom, 2.5-bath home in Cupertino last June. A resident of Incline Village, Nev., who kept the Cupertino house as a second home, Mr. Keenly says he listed the property with Ms. Perry for $1.15 million and got full price after four offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't have to negotiate down," says Mr. Keenly, who bought the Cupertino home in 1985 for $235,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In certain down markets, some buyers are jumping in because they figure prices won't go much lower. "We saw prices not really dropping and the employment market getting better," says Elizabeth Garcia, 42, who with her husband, Emilio, 49, bought a bank-owned three-bedroom, two-bath home in Gilroy in October for $264,000 to rent out. At its peak in 2006, the home was valued at $656,000, according to estimates by Zillow, the online market tracker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We thought jumping in now would be a good thing," says Ms. Garcia, a human-resources director. The Garcias now are planning to list their four-bedroom home in San Jose next month so they can move to a home with more acreage in Morgan Hill, says their broker, Lianne Pinkston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home-sales prices dipped 0.9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter in Morgan Hill, but sales were up 5.5%, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>. The prices in Gilroy fell 9.6% on flat sales over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Andrew and Jessica Wong decided to take the plunge last summer and sold their four-bedroom home in Fremont for slightly below the asking price of $1.35 million. The couple used the money to buy a comparable-size home on a 4.5-acre lot in Morgan Hill for $1.16 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's something we wanted to do for a long time, but we put it on hold because of the market," says Ms. Wong, 42, who is self-employed. Prices in Fremont decreased 12.4% in the 2011 fourth quarter from the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With home inventories running tighter in the South Bay and many other local markets, some agents say it is a matter of time until demand exceeds supply and prices start rising across the board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there is another looming factor that should boost the market: <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, which recently filed to go public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Things are looking up," Ms. Pinkston says, "especially with the IPO of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK—Another batch of positive economic data helped bolster the euro and growth-sensitive currencies against the dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro briefly jumped back above $1.32 Wednesday following improving manufacturing data out of Europe and the U.S. Reports also indicated another month of steady growth in U.S. private sector payrolls and a jump in construction spending, adding to the upbeat environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expectations that a Greek debt restructuring was imminent further lifted the euro, but as the day wore on and no deal was completed, the common currency gave back some of those gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late Wednesday, the euro was at $1.3159 from $1.3083 late Tuesday. The euro traded at ¥100.31 from ¥99.70.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for International Finance said Wednesday that it expects a Greek deal in the "days ahead," which reduced the optimism that came earlier in the day when a Greek finance ministry official said a deal could come within hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The push and pull of the market on every Greek headline indicates just how on edge traders remain about the region's sovereign-debt crisis. Fitch Ratings' David Riley reiterated at a conference in New York Wednesday that a debt restructuring will be considered a default by the ratings firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greece has been "a frustrating story: The [restructuring] is going to be resolved any day now, every day now, for the last two weeks," said Richard Franulovich, a senior currency strategist at <span class="companylink">Westpac Banking Corp</span>. in New York. Assuming a deal eventually gets done and Greece "doesn't fall apart, [the euro] is probably going to retake the topside, but $1.34 is probably where it tops out." The euro hasn't traded above $1.34 since Dec. 9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar fared a bit better against the yen, which is considered even more of a safe harbor than the greenback. The dollar traded at ¥76.23 compared with ¥76.27.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the pound fetched $1.5829 from $1.5761, while the dollar bought 0.9155 Swiss franc from 0.9202 franc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ICE Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. dollar against a basket of currencies, was at 78.93 from 79.288 late Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Encouraging economic reports were another primary driver of market movement throughout the session. The euro and currencies closely associated to economic growth expectations such as the Australian dollar rose against the U.S. dollar after another batch of positive economic reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is increasingly positive data out of the U.S.," said Michael Woolfolk, a senior currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon in New York. The positive data have led to further investment in relatively higher-yielding assets and currencies at the low-yielding dollar's expense, Mr. Woolfolk said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private employers added 170,000 jobs in the U.S. last month, according to payroll company <span class="companylink">Automatic Data Processing Inc</span>.'s monthly report. The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index hit 54.1 in January, rising from December's reading of 53.1. December U.S. construction spending tripled forecasts, rising 1.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing data out of Europe also showed that sector improved from December to January, even if not all countries saw actual expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar fell broadly based on the improving economic conditions. Such moves are typical because the dollar is considered a safe harbor during periods where growth expectations are weak.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keith Mullin's start-up snack-food company, Gamer Grub, needs cash to become a player.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The San Diego company, which makes bags of high-energy snack food for videogame fanatics, recently struck a promotional partnership to sell its product at stores across the U.S. as part of the launch of "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3," the country's top-selling videogame. While more than 3,000 stores have agreed to sell the snacks, Mr. Mullin can't get the funds he needs to hire workers and launch a marketing campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In prior years, Mr. Mullin tapped his home-equity line of credit to inject cash into the business. But the credit line was canceled by his lender after the value of his home plummeted. That set off a chain of events that ended in Mr. Mullin losing his home. Now his business can't find the funds to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"On one side of the coin, things are great," he says. "But on the back side of the coin, it's fire and brimstone, and it's just totally brutal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is well known that the housing bust has taken a devastating toll on American families, nearly three million of which have lost their homes to foreclosure. Less known is the impact that the housing collapse is having on owners of small businesses, which have often relied upon home-equity borrowing to finance the early stages of growth and development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American business history is packed with stories of company builders, from <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart Stores Inc</span>.'s Sam Walton to Sam Adams beer brewer Jim Koch, who got key early funding from their homes. Nearly one in three small-business owners has borrowed against the equity in his or her home, or used the home as collateral for a loan to fund the business, according to a 2009 survey conducted by Gallup for the National Federation of Independent Business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, there have been some signs that the housing market is bottoming out. That included three straight months of gains in single-family home construction, and a report in January showing that the inventory of for-sale homes is at its lowest level since 2006. But home prices, which need to rise briskly to revive home-equity lending, fell again in November, tumbling 1.3% from the previous month, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index released Tuesday. They are likely to fall further over the next year. The balances of home-equity lines of credit and second mortgages have tumbled 27.5% since the end of 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That leaves cash-strapped small businesses in a jam. Without the ability to borrow against their home, thousands of potential entrepreneurs will sit out the recovery. Most don't have enough cash flow to get a traditional business loan from a bank. A recent study from Pepperdine University showed that 64% of start-ups were turned down by banks when seeking loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics, estimates that small-business owners extracted around $75 billion from their homes to fund their businesses in 2006. That has fallen to as little as $20 billion now, and isn't likely to rise much through 2012, he predicts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zandi took out a $40,000 business loan using his home in suburban Philadelphia as collateral in 1991 to start a predecessor company to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. These days, it would be difficult for others to follow in his footsteps, he says. "That is one more reason to be nervous that small businesses won't be the source of job growth they have in past economic recoveries," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation could get worse. Owners of start-ups are believed to have taken out risky mortgages at a higher rate than typical homeowners, putting them at a higher risk of losing their homes and their businesses over the next couple of years. Samuel Bornstein, an accounting professor at Kean University in New Jersey, and private consultant Jung Song have done research that suggests 3.7 million small businesses took out exotic loan products such as option-adjustable rate mortgages and interest-only loans. They estimate more than 500,000 are at risk of defaulting in the next few years as their monthly mortgage payments spike after these loans reset and require both principal and interest payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adrian Pelkus, a San Marcos, Calif., business owner used home-equity loans to fund at least six start-up businesses in the past 15 years. He started his flagship company, A Squared Technologies Inc., which makes circuit boards for electronics manufacturers, with a $10,000 loan against his home in 1985.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Pelkus has been thwarted by the housing bust. In 2008, he says, he hit on his best idea yet—to generate power from ocean waves. He patented the idea and produced a prototype for the product, and planned to borrow against his home to do lab tests and market the idea to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by 2009, Southern California prices had declined so far that Mr. Pelkus was underwater by more than $100,000 on the three houses he owns near San Diego. He gave up on wave power, let his patents expire and moved on to other things—developing electric cars and medical devices with his old company. He is unsure of where his next round of funding will come from, and he can't afford to hire the 12 engineers and technicians he needs for A Squared to bid on new technology projects. "Without being able to tap home equity, it's hard take an idea far enough to get traction," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many small-business owners see their home-equity lines of credit pulled or reduced when home prices fall. In its quarterly survey of about 400 small to midsize businesses, conducted this past fall, Barlow Research Associates Inc., a Minneapolis-based business data provider, found that 41% of small businesses reported seeing their home-equity credit level decrease in the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Brown, a financial planner from Clarkston, Mich., had to slash his staff after his line of credit was yanked. In 2006, he borrowed $415,000 against the equity in his home, then appraised by the bank at $1.4 million. In 2009, his lender, Chase Home Mortgage, sent him a letter saying that based on the depressed value of the house, the bank would no longer honor any draws against his home-equity loan. Chase declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brown had to lay off seven of his 12 employees, cut back on marketing materials for his business and hold off on buying financial software. Selling the home isn't an option. Mr. Brown's daughter is disabled, and the home is outfitted to her needs. The home's value also is underwater. It is worth about $556,000, according to real estate website Zillow, and has a total of approximately $950,000 in mortgage debt on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some entrepreneurs have been able to hold on to their home-equity lines by convincing banks that their businesses are safe risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brad Alcock owns a small company in Missouri that imports a food packaging product from Taiwan, which he sells to suppliers who use it to seal bags of vegetables and other foods. In 2009, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> revoked the line of credit he was using to fund his Taiwan purchases. He was able to convince the bank to reinstate it two weeks later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a period of time where I owe Asia, but I'm not paid yet," he says. "It had me in about a two-week panic." <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> confirmed that Mr. Alcock's credit line was frozen in January 2009 because of "decreasing equity in the market" but said it was reinstated a month later "based on the broad customer relationship with the bank."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other entrepreneurs have turned to the U.S. Small Business Administration, which guarantees bank loans to entrepreneurs. For the year that ended Sept. 30, 2011, the SBA guaranteed more loans, measured by dollar amount, than in any previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mullin, the founder of Gamer Grub, drained his savings, took out $60,000 in loans backed by the SBA and borrowed from friends and family. Still, it wasn't enough to expand as rapidly as he needed to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, he began traveling and meeting with angel investors in an effort to raise $1.5 million to help the company grow. So far he has had three investor groups "kick the tires" on Gamer Grub, but had no luck in raising funds. He has been paying bills to his manufacturers using money left over from a previous business he started, which makes pet supplies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As an entrepreneur, it's your job to basically pull a rabbit out of your hat on a daily basis," he says. "That's how hard it is right now."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices fell again in November, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller indexes, indicating continued struggles for the beleaguered housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sector has remained sluggish despite lower prices and interest rates due to a slowly improving economy, an abundance of foreclosures and tighter mortgage requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Tighter lending standards and widespread expectations of further declines in home values have been depressing home sales on a larger scale," said economists Ellen Zentner, Aichi Amemiy and Jeffrey Greenberg of Nomura Economics Research in a note to clients. "In addition, a growing share of distressed assets in home sales that are typically sold at a 20% discount are putting downward pressure on house prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For November, the Case-Shiller index of 10 major metropolitan areas and the 20-city index both fell 1.3% from the previous month. David M. Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&amp;P Indices, also noted that 19 of the 20 major U.S. metropolitan markets covered by the indices in November saw prices decline from October, with just Phoenix showing an increase. Atlanta, Las Vegas, Seattle and Tampa posted new index level lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The only positive for the month was Phoenix, one of the hardest hit in recent years," Mr. Blitzer said. "Annual rates were little better as 18 cities and both composites were negative." Just Detroit and Washington D.C. notched year-over-year gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-city and 20-city composites posted annual returns of negative 3.6% and negative 3.7%, respectively, compared with November 2010. Hard-hit Atlanta had the worst year-over-year performance, declining 11.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a seasonally adjusted basis, which aims to take into account the slower selling season in the winter, three cities -- Denver, Minneapolis and Phoenix -- posted monthly increases. The overall 20-city index was down 0.7% from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been indications more recently of some stabilization in home sales, and economists say that may show up in price data later this year. "Economic growth has accelerated, jobs growth has picked-up and confidence has increased. Banks even seem a little more willing to lend. After the normal lead time of around six months, the resulting rise in home sales should go some way to bringing an end to the five-year-long decline in house prices," said Paul Dales, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's report that prices continue to slump has tempered hopes that the U.S. housing market is finally turning. But right now, the connection between what the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index says and what is actually going on with housing may be lukewarm at best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 20-city home-price index slipped 1.3% in November from October, putting it 3.7% below its year-earlier level. The implication: Supply has continued to outstrip demand, pushing prices lower, despite the upbeat tempo of other housing data and positive vibes from home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller index is closely watched for a reason. It was quicker than a U.S. government price index to show just how bad things were as housing came off the rails in 2007. The difference: The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> index includes only homes with mortgages guaranteed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, while the Case-Shiller index includes those backed by jumbo and subprime mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many homes that were backed by subprime mortgages are now being sold in foreclosure. They aren't in nearly as good condition as when they were last bought, and are selling for less than if they had been properly maintained. Because the Case-Shiller index is based on repeat sales, such homes may be biasing it downward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the Case-Shiller index is based on a three-month average of sales, so its November level includes transactions that were completed in October and September. Consider that it takes about two months between a sale and a closing (often longer with mortgage hassles these days), and you are talking about deals agreed on in the summer, when recession fears filled the air. Things now look better. Home prices probably do, too.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Joseph De Avila   </div><div>528 words</div><div>31 January 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A20</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City's construction industry was dealt another tough year as the value of construction projects that began in 2011 sank 31% compared with 2010, new data released on Monday said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reduced government spending on infrastructure and very few new, large commercial buildings contributed to the building industry's poor 2011. The value of construction starts fell by $6.2 billion in 2011 to $13.8 billion, according to the analysis by the New York Building Congress, an association representing real-estate developers and construction companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lone bright spot was that residential construction projects rose nearly 25% to $2.9 million in 2011, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, two construction projects costing $500 million or more were started in the city. In 2010, there were seven, including three -- at the World Trade Center site, the renovation of Madison Square Garden and the groundbreaking at the <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> Arena -- that accounted for $6 billion of new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard T. Anderson, president of the New York Building Congress, cautions that just a few projects can skew annual figures. But "there really is a slowdown on the nonresidential side," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of nonresidential development, which includes offices, hotels and schools, fell by $5.3 billion, or 39%. Government infrastructure projects also were off for the third straight year, falling last year by $1.4 billion, or 35%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction industry lost 4,500 jobs in New York City, which was the most of any industry in 2011, according to real-estate services firm Eastern Consolidated. Since September 2009, the construction industry has lost 14,000 jobs, or nearly 12% of its work force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pent-up demand for rental units and lenders who have become more willing to finance construction for rental apartments likely contributed to the improvement in residential construction starts last year, said Melissa Pianko, executive vice president of development, with <span class="companylink">Gotham Organization</span>, a real-estate developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Strong developers are accessing the debt markets in ways they didn't in the past," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gotham is building a 1,238-unit rental-apartment tower on West 45th Street called Gotham West. It was the most expensive residential project to break ground at the city in 2011, with construction costs estimated to be just over $360 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financing for luxury condo development also remains relatively robust, said Vishaan Chakrabarti, the director of the Center for Urban Real Estate at Columbia University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The luxury market in condos is still quite strong, but that middle market still has a ways to go," Mr. Chakrabarti said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strict financing standards are one of the main reasons New York City isn't churning out apartments as it did in years past. Last year, 10,000 residential units received permission to begin construction in the city, up from 6,000 in 2009, Mr. Anderson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But 10,000 new housing units a year is only half the amount the city needs to meet new demand. "It's encouraging that the trend is upward but it needs to get a lot better than that," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Arian Campo-Flores   </div><div>1714 words</div><div>31 January 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DELTONA, Fla. -- Any politician who wants to use Florida's housing collapse as a way to win the vote of Claudio Fernandez faces a stiff challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fernandez thought he had secured a piece of the American dream for his two kids when he bought a pair of homes here in 2006 that he planned to rent out and eventually pass on to them. Then the housing market tanked, some of his renters lost their jobs and he had to tap his savings to cover his losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After two years of maddening negotiations with lenders, Mr. Fernandez says, he is about to lose one home in a short sale -- in which the price is less than the money owed on the property -- and is still trying to modify the loan on the second. In the process, he says he has lost nearly $50,000, taken on more debt and trashed his credit rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though he mainly blames the banks and himself, he fumes at political leaders, too. "They bailed out business and Wall Street" but "failed to bail out the American citizen," says Mr. Fernandez, a 43-year-old Republican who voted for President Barack Obama in 2008. Looking to November, he says, "if it's the current field -- Obama and these clowns in the Republican party -- I'd rather not vote." He has no plans to cast a ballot in Florida's Republican primary on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many share Mr. Fernandez's frustration as well as his political reaction in foreclosure-racked Volusia County, a key electoral battleground at the eastern end of the Interstate 4 corridor in Central Florida, where elections in the state are often decided. Those who have been touched directly by foreclosure -- 28% of Volusia's mortgages were in foreclosure or seriously delinquent as of October -- along with neighbors who have watched their property values plummet are angry and restive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It makes for a volatile brew as Florida Republicans prepare to vote in their primary Tuesday. Over the weekend, the top Republican contenders again dug into each other as polls showing big leads for Mitt Romney put rival Newt Gingrich on the defensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Naples, Fla., on Sunday, Mr. Romney tried to link Mr. Gingrich's consulting work for mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> to Florida's troubled housing market. "I know how bad housing is here. . ..You know how much home values have come down,"" he said, blaming lending practices by Freddie and <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> for the downturn. Mr. Gingrich, he said, was paid "to stand up and say these programs should continue the way they are; these institutions are fine. . ..The people of Florida have had enough of <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>.""</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gingrich, the former House speaker, said Mr. Romney had built his lead in the polls through negative campaigning. "He has a basic policy of carpet bombing his opponent," Mr. Gingrich said on "Fox News Sunday."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than heed the calls of candidates who blame one another for the mess, many voters are merely disillusioned, saying they hear nothing from any of the candidates suggesting they offer a path out. Residents affected by the housing slump often say the upshot is they can't decide who to support or may choose not to vote at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Volusia is one of three swing counties in swing states -- Florida, Ohio and Colorado -- that The Wall Street Journal is visiting periodically this year to gauge how the election campaign is unfolding. As the Republican presidential candidates tour Florida, foreclosures have been an especially hot topic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though last year Mr. Romney said the foreclosure process should be allowed to "run its course," he has moderated his tone in Florida, saying he is open to working with lenders to stabilize the housing market. Mr. Gingrich has said he would encourage banks to approve more short sales of properties whose owners owe more than the homes are worth and attacked Mr. Romney for his own investments in bank- and mortgage-company stocks and bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his State of the Union address last week Mr. Obama proposed legislation that would help homeowners refinance mortgages at lower interest rates. The administration says it has already helped millions of families with existing programs, including one that has led to nearly 910,000 permanent loan modifications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few say they have noticed such efforts in Volusia, where "For Sale" signs cover neighborhoods and residents are grappling with 10.1% unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Florida accounted for less than 8% of all mortgages in the U.S. in September, it made up nearly 25% of all loans in foreclosure, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. In Volusia, almost a third of mortgages were in foreclosure or seriously delinquent in October, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span>., a research firm. The median price of a single-family home tumbled to $98,800 in October, down 54% from $217,000 in 2006, says Morgan Gilreath, the county property appraiser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, five states -- Florida, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan and California -- have borne the brunt of the housing collapse. All of them, except California, are expected to be important presidential-campaign battlegrounds. The two other swing counties the Journal is visiting this year have fared better. In Ohio's Hamilton County, about 10% of borrowers were in foreclosure or seriously delinquent in October, and in Colorado's Arapahoe County, about 7% were.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Volusia, the city of Deltona -- the county's biggest, with 85,000 people -- was hard-hit by the mortgage meltdown. A bedroom community of Orlando with no downtown and no hospital, Deltona experienced a frenzy of building during the housing boom, followed by a collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One recent day, real-estate broker Sheree Frazier pulled up a multiple-listing-service map of the area, including the neighboring cities of DeBary and DeLand, on her computer. Apart from a scattering of symbols showing pending or completed sales, it was blanketed with gavels, signifying foreclosures. "This is far from being over," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Frazier, who sold her personal home in a short sale, says there is only one solution: Banks need to write down the principal on homeowners' mortgages and take the losses. "We need [a president] who's willing to take the bull by the horns, and I mean the banks," says Ms. Frazier, a Republican. Mr. Obama "ain't done squat." Yet none of the Republican candidates embrace the dramatic step she proposes to end the foreclosure wave, and she doesn't like any of them either, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People interviewed for this article who have faced, or gone through, foreclosure uniformly say the experience so consumed and upended their lives that they had little time to deal with anything else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mercedes Coviella, a 40-year-old clerical temp who is still going through the process, says she and her husband separated because of the stress, leaving her a single mother of two. "I'm so busy with my day-to-day duties that I haven't had a chance to watch the [GOP] debates," says Ms. Coviella, a Republican from DeBary. "I honestly don't have any clue what anyone's talking about now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such upheaval makes it hard to gauge the political effect of the housing crisis. Those ensnared by it share an antipathy toward the banks. And they say they fault both parties for failing to resolve the mess and favoring the interests of Wall Street over those of homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I blame the Republican administration at the time" the housing downturn began, says Mr. Fernandez. "And then I blame the Democratic administration for the handling of it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of those interviewed say they have heard anything close to a solution from the current crop of candidates. "Most of the candidates come from wealthy backgrounds," says Ms. Coviella. "It's hard for them to see people on my level worried about paying groceries."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among partisan voters, the housing crisis seems to have reaffirmed pre-existing views. One 68-year-old Republican man from DeLand who lost his home to a short sale says the government should get out of the way. "You have to be self-reliant," he says, adding that he plans to vote for the eventual GOP nominee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, Lee Banks, a 54-year-old Democrat from DeLand who has been trying to negotiate a loan modification for more than two years, says government should do more. "A man in need should be able to get some kind of help," he says. He plans to vote for Mr. Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voters in the middle, though, say they will have a harder time choosing. "I'll vote for whoever gives my [unemployed] husband a job," says Judy Evans, a 59-year-old DeLand resident who declined to give her party affiliation. But she says politicians are "all full of bull. They get in and don't do anything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some say they are so disgusted at the government's inability to fix the economy that they plan to sit out this election. "I'm not voting this year," says a 66-year-old Democrat from DeLand who voted for President Obama in 2008 and has since sold her home in a short sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who have experienced foreclosure directly aren't the only ones battered by housing's collapse. Deltona "has taken a huge fiscal hit" because of declining property-tax revenue, says Democratic City Commissioner Heidi Herzberg. That forced the city to cut jobs and pare expenses. As residents moved out and job losses accelerated, local businesses shut down and some shopping plazas became wastelands. Foreclosed homes became neighborhood eyesores,. Though the local economy is perking up, it has a long way to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Schmidt, a 39-year-old cable salesman from Deltona, says at least five of the houses on his block have gone through foreclosure, including the ones on either side of his. "My property value has plummeted," he says. Like the 46% of mortgage borrowers in Volusia County who owe more than their homes are worth, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, his home loan is underwater.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A majority of Americans recently surveyed say now is a good time to buy a home. That's no surprise, given that record-low mortgage interest rates and bargain home prices are boosting affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But selling a home? That's a different story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to 71% of the 1,000 people surveyed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> in December, now is a good time to buy a house. But only 11% think it's a good time to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's because sellers sense that even if the housing market and the economy continue to show signs of improvement in 2012, the good news likely won't be good enough for buyers to return to the market in droves—even if they can buy a home for a steal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For people to start buying in larger volume, they need to see home prices go up a bit," says Ingo Winzer, president of Local Market Monitor, a firm that analyzes housing markets for bankers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many potential buyers also are waiting to see the jobs picture improve, which will give them confidence in the stability of their own employment, Mr. Winzer says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Improvements Ahead</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, various forecasts and surveys suggest better times for the housing market this year:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes are expected to grow between 2% and 5% in 2012, according a recent forecast from <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent survey of about 1,000 Re/Max real-estate agents found that 39% of agents think prices have hit bottom in their market, while almost 75% think home prices in their markets will have stopped declining by the end of 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of improving housing markets rose to 76 in January, from 41 in December, according to the Improving Markets Index, from <span class="companylink">First American Financial Corp</span>. and the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, home prices are expected to be relatively flat in 2012, says Alex Villacorta, director of research and analytics at Clear Capital, a provider of real-estate asset-valuation data for financial-services companies. Indeed, 2012 seems to be a turning point before a healthier and sustained recovery in 2013, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If You Can Hold Out</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While now still may not be the perfect time to sell a home, it may be time for home sellers to get their places ready for a sale next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, markets vary. Prices already are on the rise in some places, including parts of Florida, Washington, D.C., and Dayton, Ohio, Mr. Villacorta says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other markets—including Chicago, Atlanta, Detroit and Las Vegas—continue to be on a "downward slide," according to a December report from Realtor.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either way, holding out until next year could mean a quicker and more profitable sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"From a seller's point of view, it's still a little early, though tempting, to put the house up for sale and expect a lot of demand," Mr. Villacorta says. "Unless there are circumstances that dictate they have to sell now, certainly waiting and tracking the markets a little bit more would be a more prudent thing to do."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some sellers have delayed their moving decisions for years now. For those champing at the bit to make a sale and move on with their lives, 2012 may offer glimmers of hope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are a lot of people over the last few years that decided to put their life on hold," says Budge Huskey, president of real-estate brokerage Coldwell Banker. Some now are saying, 'I've waited long enough. I can't put life on hold forever,' " Mr. Huskey says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market is finally nearing the point where people who don't need to sell for financial reasons are starting to consider a move for lifestyle-related reasons, he says, such as a growing family that would be more comfortable in a larger home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news for them: Inventory plunged to a 6.2-month supply in December, from a 12.4 month supply in July 2010, according to the National Association of Realtors. That means there are fewer sellers competing for buyers. (The month-supply figure is how long it would take to sell all the homes on the market now based on the current rate of sales per month. The higher the number, the more sellers there are looking for buyers.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If You Can't Wait</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you plan to sell a home this year, get the house in the best possible condition and price it to sell before it hits the market, Mr. Huskey says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An appealing online listing, complete with quality photographs, is also crucial to bring traffic to your home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The buyer has the opportunity to prescreen all the homes online and see only the few that really shine online," Mr. Huskey says, so a seller should do everything he or she can to get on a buyer's shortlist of homes to physically visit.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Mitchell and Robbie Whelan   </div><div>783 words</div><div>27 January 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American businesses stepped up their spending going into the new year, propelled by an economic upswing that has yet to lift much of the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders for U.S. durable goods -- those lasting longer than three years, such as automobiles and kitchen appliances -- rose 3% in December from November, the Commerce Department said Thursday. The data suggest that business spending on equipment climbed for the first time in three months, indicating renewed confidence among companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, a separate report Thursday reflected weakness in housing -- a departure from a recent stream of signals that the sector may be inching out of its recession-era depths. Sales of newly built homes were weaker than expected in December, falling 2.2% from November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 307,000 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of 2011, builders sold 302,000 new homes, which is the smallest number since the Census Bureau began tracking such sales in 1963.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report last week said sales of existing homes -- which usually fetch lower prices than new ones, particularly amid a glut of foreclosed properties -- rose in December for the third straight month, bringing the supply of homes listed for sale to the lowest level since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Crowe, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, expects new-home sales to rise to 360,000 this year, an improvement from 2011 but still about one-third of the rate of sales during the peak years of the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's been a terrible year," said Craig Perry, chief executive of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based Centerline Homes, which sold 300 homes last year, down from 400 in 2010. "It's an inventory thing. You have to wait for the inventory to clear. There's a lot of resale that's distressed out there, a lot that's not distressed, and then there's the shadow market. We just need to reach an equilibrium."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the housing market has much ground to regain, corporations are poised to boost production in coming months, powering the U.S. recovery as other parts of the world slow down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors are at play. Demand for automobiles has taken off as Americans who put off purchases during the recession and early in the recovery are now replacing cars and buying new ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, manufacturers -- who saw business slow over the summer -- say demand is picking up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you put it all together it looks like we have some good momentum in manufacturing," said Jonathan Basile, an economist at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>. "It's been a strong point in the recovery, and it looks like it remains a strong point because it's still growing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's durable-goods numbers, along with indicators of a brighter outlook among employers, signal pockets of strength in the American economy even as Asia loses momentum and the euro zone teeters toward recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in durable goods was spurred by demand for airplanes. However, there were gains in every major category, from primary metals to machinery, with the exceptions being electrical equipment and defense products. Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- a proxy for business spending -- rose 2.9%, after two months of declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Caterpillar Inc</span>., for one, on Thursday reported a 60% rise in fourth-quarter profit and said it expects record sales in 2012. The Peoria, Ill., maker of bulldozers and other earth-moving machinery said it is more optimistic now than three months ago that a global recession won't occur in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The improvement in orders has created growing backlogs as order books are swelling" at U.S. manufacturers, said economist Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa. "That is occurring despite firms accelerating their shipping activity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report Thursday reflected growing confidence. The Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators, designed to predict the direction of the economy, rose four-tenths of a point in December to 94.3. The board said the rise was in part due to a change in the way the index is calculated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the number of Americans filing initial claims for jobless benefits rose by 21,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 377,000, the Labor Department said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That followed a big drop in claims the previous week. The four-week moving average, which smooths out weekly volatility in the numbers, fell by 2,500 to 377,500.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Florida's sun-drenched Gulf Coast, the sale of about 320 home sites in Fiddlers Creek, a huge, luxury-home community near Naples, speaks volumes about the changing economics of home building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developer Aubrey Ferrao sold 227 lots to <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. and 91 lots to <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>. for an average of about $100,000 each, a surprisingly high number in a state where home sale prices continue to languish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing experts say Mr. Ferrao was able to charge that much because public home builders these days prefer to buy relatively smaller parcels of land in markets that already have seen sales instead of bigger, riskier tracts. Fiddlers Creek, which already has amenities like a golf course, has sold 1,743 homes, with another 4,257 planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some parts of Florida like Naples and nearby Marco Island, lot prices are at the highest levels since the boom, says Brad Hunter, chief economist at Metrostudy, a housing-research firm that tracks land sales. "Builders are willing to pay the premium not to have a lot of land on their books," he says. "Some people wonder if they're making any money at all."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the story of the Fiddlers Creek deal also shows how lousy the home-sales business has become. Mr. Ferrao, who purchased land for Fiddlers Creek starting in 1993, spent the boom years building homes and selling them for an average of $1.3 million apiece to Midwestern retirees and vacationers. He says his profit margin was 40%, thanks to the soaring housing market and his low land cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lennar</span> and <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> plan to sell homes for $380,000 to $750,000, company officials say. They decline to discuss profit margin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People can now buy a Bentley at Buick prices," Mr. Ferrao says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A native of the South Indian coastal region of Goa, Mr. Ferrao has seen both the ups and downs of the housing cycle. A U.S. citizen since the mid-1980s, he moved to Naples after visiting it for a wedding, and the area, with its warm climate and "tropical pace of life," reminded him of his home. "I said to myself, 'I've got to find some way to get down here,'" he recalls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around 1986, Mr. Ferrao began buying coastal land and building high-rise condominiums. In 1993, he ventured into the world of single-family homes, borrowing $150 million from a Japanese lender to buy 1,300 acres of foreclosed land and calling the project Fiddlers Creek. Over the next decade, he added land until the community was 4,000 acres and borrowed more to build amenities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, he was one of the region's biggest builder-developers, selling Italian-style villas with high-end kitchens and polished-brass doorknobs, near a well-groomed golf course and not far from the Gulf beaches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the housing crash hit Naples hard: Home values, once red-hot, withered. The median price of a home in Florida fell to $135,000 by the end of 2011, down 45% from its high of $247,000 in the peak year of 2006, based on the Florida Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Naples, the declines have been even more severe. In 2006, homes were selling at a median price of $530,000 in the upscale Naples-Marco Island market; in Naples, they had fallen to $210,000 by the end of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fiddlers Creek also used municipal bonds to finance its infrastructure, and Mr. Ferrao continues to battle with the project's bondholders over who should pay debt service on some $100 million of the bonds, and when they should be paid. In early 2010, with no apparent end to the housing crisis, Fiddler's Creek filed for bankruptcy protection, listing a $165 million mortgage in addition to the bond debt. Gulf Bay Group of Cos., Mr. Ferrao's company, said the project had lost more than half of its $700 million value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ferrao restructured his debts and retained control of the project after it emerged from bankruptcy court in September, but his days of selling multimillion-dollar homes in gated communities in the Naples area were over. He stopped building at Fiddler's Creek, and instead began to sell the land he had accumulated there to large national builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I can make more money in Naples selling land than I can selling homes," he says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan   </div><div>640 words</div><div>21 January 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes rose in December for the third straight month, bringing the supply of homes listed for sale to the lowest level since 2006 and offering a glimmer of hope that the housing market could be starting to climb out of a profound downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales increased 5% in December from a month earlier, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.61 million units, the National Association of Realtors said Friday. Lawrence Yun, the Realtors' chief economist, called the December gain "a good finish to a very tough year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists had predicted that 2011 would be the worst year on record for existing home sales, but the year ended with 4.26 million sales, about 1.6% higher than the 4.19 million existing homes sold in 2010. Market-watchers attributed this to a minor surge in sales at year-end, driven by historically low mortgage rates, falling prices, active investor-buyers and increasing consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, economists cautioned that it's too early to assume that the market is recovering. "These were positive numbers, but that doesn't mean the market is getting better. Lenders have been trying to get rid of distressed homes, and investors been snapping them up," said Patrick Newport, chief economist at IHS Global Insight. According to the Realtors report, investors purchased 21% of all homes in December, up from 19% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of homes for sale declined in December to 2.38 million, the equivalent of a 6.2-month supply, assuming the pace of sales remain at December's level. A six-month supply of homes typically is considered healthy, although NAR's numbers don't take into account the "shadow inventory" of homes that are either in foreclosure or on bank balance sheets and not yet listed for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices, meanwhile, continue to fall. The median price in December was $164,500, down 2.5% from a year earlier. Prices were down in all regions except the West, where prices rose slightly, compared with a year ago. For all of 2011, the median was $166,100, the lowest since 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What you really want to see is sales going up, inventories going down, and prices going up, not down," said David Semmens, an economist with Standard Chartered. "People still feel they can hold off buying a house because the recovery won't be that aggressive. It's still very much a buyer's market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That buyer's market allowed Andrew Gonzales, a 24-year-old police officer in Santa Fe, N.M., to be picky about price when looking for a home for himself and his three-year-old daughter. He closed last month on a $132,000, three-bedroom home in Rio Rancho, a suburb of Albuquerque, after the price was cut twice. Just before closing, the home was appraised for $18,000 higher than the sales price, at $150,000, by a private appraiser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I got tired of paying rent, and I'm a single father, so I wanted a home for my daughter," he said. "I was just waiting for the price to come down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vision Equity, a company that buys foreclosed homes at auctions in Indianapolis, stepped up the volume of its purchases this winter, buying about 45 homes a month in October, November and December, compared with about 30 homes a month last summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a lot of cash investor activity right now," said Steve Olson, a spokesman for Vision Equity. "The chatter at the courthouse was, there's going to be a lot more product coming on the market, and the pricing is going to be good for investors. And we prepared our own investors for that."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Mitchell   </div><div>581 words</div><div>20 January 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. consumer is starting off 2012 on a somewhat sounder footing than before, as everyday prices ease and the labor market strengthens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consumer-price index, which measures what Americans pay for everything from automobiles to groceries, was unchanged in December from the previous month, the Labor Department said Thursday. Overall inflation was 3% for the year -- the greatest increase since 2007 -- but prices have been flat or down since October, largely because of a drop in gasoline costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the number of Americans filing initial jobless claims tumbled last week to a nearly four-year low, falling 50,000 to a seasonally adjusted 352,000, the Labor Department said. That shows that employers are continuing to slow the pace of layoffs, which will likely translate into more jobs following a recent pickup in hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, Americans still are feeling an economic strain. More than 13 million individuals are out of work -- and millions more are stuck in part-time jobs -- and the unemployment rate remains high at 8.5%. In 2011, wages didn't keep up with inflation, prompting many consumers to dip into savings and, more recently, to step up borrowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market, which has weighed on the recovery, has much ground to regain. A Commerce Department report Thursday showed that home construction fell 4.1% in December, capping what one economist called one of the "worst years on record" for the home-construction industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts also cautioned that an economic shock -- such as last year's gas-price spike and the earthquake in Japan -- could knock U.S. consumers and the recovery off course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for now, some Americans are finding they have a hint more breathing room than they did just a few months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christelle Durand, of Queens, N.Y., spent last summer and fall unemployed while she looked for a job in sports management, after earning her master's degree from Georgetown University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After dozens of job applications went unanswered, Ms. Durand, who is 23 years old, signed up with a temporary-help agency and two months ago started as a support staffer for a design team in the fashion industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said she feels more secure now that she has a steady income and can start paying down her $8,000 student loan. She enjoys the occasional dinner out and is focused on turning her temporary position into a permanent one. "I'm comfortable here, I'm comfortable doing what I'm doing," Ms. Duran said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If more Americans get jobs and become more confident about the economy, they will be more likely to spend money, said Stephen Stanley, an economist at Pierpont Securities LLC. An increase in consumer spending -- which represents about two-thirds of the economy and has been a driver of the recovery -- would help the economy grow in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increased consumer confidence, prompted by jobs gains, lower costs and higher wages, could help end that standoff, Mr. Stanley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's consumer-price report showed that not all costs are going down. Energy prices fell 1.3% on a 2% drop in gasoline. But food prices rose 0.2% amid higher costs for cereals and meats. "Core" prices -- which strip out volatile food and energy -- edged 0.1% higher from November to December. That was due largely to rental increases that sent overall housing costs up .1%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan and Craig Karmin   </div><div>645 words</div><div>19 January 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>24</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calpers, the giant California pension fund, is dumping one of its last major housing investments at a big loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a major step toward winding down a two-decade program as the pension world's biggest player in the U.S. housing market, Calpers is selling a portfolio of 28 housing communities to a partnership between San Diego-based developer Newland Real Estate Group LLC and an affiliate of Japan's largest home-building company, <span class="companylink">Sekisui House Ltd</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The portfolio, which includes 16,300 unbuilt home sites and thousands of acres of additional undeveloped land in 11 states, represents about one-fifth of Calpers' residential land portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People familiar with the terms said the portfolio sold for between $500 million and $600 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that price range, the deal values each home site at about $35,000, at most. During the housing boom, big builders would typically buy the land underneath new homes for $75,000 to $150,000, depending on location and state of infrastructure completion. This means that Calpers, which bought the property over about five years starting in 2002, is likely suffering a loss of as much as 30% to 50%, the people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calpers move comes after three years of distressed-land sales by other major owners, including builders and banks that have driven down values by as much as 75% in some markets. Calpers has resisted a major liquidation of its holdings until recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the past decade, Calpers was the biggest U.S. public pension fund investing in residential housing and land deals, in certain deals using debt to finance up to 80% of the purchases. That boosted returns, but also risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently Calpers has about 9% of its $226 billion in assets invested in real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calpers officials say they are looking to real estate for stability rather than high yields. "The plan calls for real estate to be a diversifier . . . to provide stable cash yields and to act as a partial inflation hedge," says Calpers spokesman Wayne Davis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the bubble burst, Calpers began suffering losses on a number of deals -- losing more than $900 million on one deal alone. Last year, the pension giant started overhauling its real-estate-investment program and since then, it has put in place a plan to sell down its portfolio and concentrate on safer, income-producing commercial property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calpers officials think they are moving in the right direction. While the real-estate portfolio lost nearly half its value, or about $10 billion from March 2008 to June 2009, Calpers says, it has rebounded more recently. For the 12 months through September, the most recent numbers available, the real estate portfolio returned 14%, according to Calpers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calpers' latest sale marks a widening U.S. beachhead for the North American unit of Sekisui, a 51-year-old Japanese home builder that is among the most aggressive foreign companies looking to take advantage of the distress in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, Sekisui and Newland formed a joint venture to buy 500 acres near Houston, and in May of last year they teamed up again to buy more than 4,000 acres outside of Seattle. Satoshi Yoshimura, president of Sekisui's North American operations, said that the company is looking at the Calpers investment as a long-term play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are not interested in American land overall," he said in an email. "We identified specific target markets whose fundamentals could support mid- to long-term growth potential and a relatively good business environment for developers and home builders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newland has been managing Calpers land projects since 1994, and began talks with North American Sekisui House in 2009. Slow growth in Japan had led Sekisui to explore other markets, including the U.S., China and Australia.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his second meeting as chairman of the Federal Reserve in May 2006, Ben Bernanke heard a Fed governor warn about the nation's mortgage market. But Mr. Bernanke described the cooling of the housing boom as a "healthy thing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So far we are seeing, at worst, an orderly decline in the housing market," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke's words were contained in 1,197 pages of transcripts released Thursday of closed-door <span class="companylink">Fed</span> meetings from that year. The transcripts paint the most detailed picture yet of how top officials at the central bank didn't anticipate the storm about to hit the U.S. economy and the global financial system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A handful of <span class="companylink">Fed</span> officials warned of trouble. But, for the most part, officials were expecting a manageable slowdown in housing, with little damage to the financial system or broader economy, the transcripts show. Mr. Bernanke predicted a "soft landing" for the economy as 2006 ended, not a housing bust that would trigger the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke has acknowledged the <span class="companylink">Fed</span>'s failings as a bank overseer before the crisis, and he has vowed to do better now that the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> has emerged from the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul with more supervisory power. A Fed spokesman Thursday pointed to Mr. Bernanke's earlier comments on the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas Fed, said Thursday that once the economic turmoil hit in 2007, "the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> did react to the crisis in a most effective way. That has now been proven. Whether we were, as a group, late to get on the stick is of course debatable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transcripts show <span class="companylink">Fed</span> officials offering praise for outgoing Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who attended his final <span class="companylink">Fed</span> meeting in January 2006. Timothy Geithner, then president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and now Treasury Secretary, playfully offered this forecast about Mr. Greenspan's legacy: "I think the risk that we decide in the future that you're even better than we think is higher than the alternative." Mr. Greenspan's reputation subsequently was tarnished by the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Fed</span> is under attack by some Republican lawmakers, presidential candidates and other critics who say its easy-money policies, particularly under Mr. Greenspan, fueled the credit bubble that led to the crisis. Mr. Bernanke has said that while bad regulation contributed to the crisis, the <span class="companylink">Fed</span>'s interest-rate policies didn't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transcripts have the potential to fuel the criticism. "This reads like a broken record," said Allan Meltzer, an economist who has written a history of the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> through 1986. <span class="companylink">The Fed</span>, he said, "One, gives too much weight to short-term forecasts; two, never discusses the medium-term consequences of its decisions; and three, ignores without any discussion warnings such as those that others tried to bring up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no doubt that Mr. Bernanke and most of his <span class="companylink">Fed</span> colleagues were concerned about the growing weakness in the housing market in 2006, which led them to pause that August after raising interest rates for two years. Mr. Bernanke often noted that housing looked particularly uncertain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices peaked in May 2006, according to an S&amp;P Case-Shiller home-price index, and have since fallen 33%. Very few economists, either inside or outside the <span class="companylink">Fed</span>, imagined at the time that such a steep decline was possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transcripts suggest the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> underestimated the extent to which the housing boom had strained the financial-services industry, particularly through exotic mortgage securities. "We have not seen-- and don't expect-- a broad deterioration in mortgage credit quality," the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> staff said in a June 2006 report to policy makers. The transcripts also suggest that the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> misgauged the potential for housing problems to spill over into the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our recent financial-market data don't, in my view, provide a convincing case for a substantial increase in the probability of a much weaker path for growth going forward," Mr. Geithner said at a meeting in December 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the ensuing six months, subprime-mortgage lenders began failing and investors shed risky mortgage debt. "Secretary Geithner was an early source of initiative at the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> to reduce risk and make the financial system more resilient even before 2006," Treasury spokesman Anthony Coley said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, after the transcripts were released, some analysts expressed sympathy for the Fed. Pierpont Securities chief economist Stephen Stanley said the <span class="companylink">Fed</span>'s view at the time "was a pretty consensus view" among analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Fed</span> spent the first part of 2006 raising short-term interest rates, a process begun under Mr. Greenspan, but that did little to increase long-term interest rates or tame the housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transcripts show some <span class="companylink">Fed</span> officials suggesting markets understood the risks of the housing slowdown. "As one CEO told me, the only subject that has been more analyzed than the housing situation is the birth of Brad Pitt's baby," Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher said in a September 2006 meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, Mr. Fisher said he wasn't dismissive of the housing threat. In that same September meeting, he noted that he was more pessimistic about housing than the <span class="companylink">Fed</span>'s economics staff in Washington. The previous month, he noted that one home builder said the housing correction was the "roughest and most sudden" he had seen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan Bies, a former banker who served as a Fed governor from 2001 until 2007, comes across in the transcripts as the most attuned to the brewing trouble. In May 2006, she warned that households were taking on so much debt that they might be vulnerable to financial shocks, such as layoffs or medical problems. She expressed dismay about the exotic mortgages that banks were offering to borrowers, particularly those in which debt grew, rather than got paid off, over time.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you live in Flushing or Bayside or Bay Ridge, you are used to yawning at news of the triumphs and excesses of the Manhattan luxury market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now owners in the boroughs have reason to cheer: Despite sales declines across New York City, median prices for homes in the rest of the city held up better than they did in Manhattan in the fourth quarter, according to new sales figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Brooklyn and the Bronx, median prices rose slightly in the final quarter of 2011 compared with the year-earlier period, and they were off 4.8% in Queens and 5.2% in Staten Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But median prices in Manhattan, including co-ops, condos and a small number of townhouse sales, dropped 8.5% to $750,000 during the latest period, according to the report from the Real Estate Board of New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales fell in every borough in the fourth quarter from the year-earlier period and were down even more from the 2011 third quarter. Overall sales in the fourth quarter were down 12% from the year-earlier period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total spending on homes fell by nearly 20% last quarter in Manhattan, compared with drops of 9.6% in Brooklyn and 12.9% in Queens. The report attributed the sales slump to "economic and financial unease over the past several months."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Slattery, senior vice president at the board, said that the Manhattan market bounced back strongly earlier last year, while other markets lagged because they were "more sensitive to economic forces and continued to feel the effects of the recession."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He attributed the shrinking Manhattan sales and prices last quarter to a slowdown in expensive new condominium sales, after buyers "burned through a lot of new development inventory."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Maguire, a broker at John A. Maguire Real Estate in Bay Ridge, said "a lull" in sales in the area late last year has been followed by a spurt in sales lately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Lowe and behold, a few days after Christmas, the cows came out the barn," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first 10 days of this year, Mr. Maguire said his firm found buyers for four houses, listed between about $750,000 and $2.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One property on 91st Street has lingered on the market since last summer, but suddenly had three bidders in the last few days, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer of another house listed for nearly $2.2 million on 76th Street planned to put down $1.1 million in cash on the house to close the deal, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lull in Manhattan sales were documented in a series of market reports released last week, but the Real Estate Board's report is the first snapshot of activity in the rest of the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the other reports, the report from the board tabulates all deeds based on the date they were filed, rather than the date they closed. As a result, the board's report includes hundreds of deals that were filed in one quarter, but closed during the next one. The report estimated citywide sales in the fourth quarter totaled $5.41 billion, off 16.9% from the year-earlier quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total Manhattan sales, hard hit by falling condo deals, fell to $2.96 billion last quarter from $3.69 billion in the year-earlier period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though condominiums are a smaller share of the market outside Manhattan, the other boroughs showed a steep decline in sale of condominiums there as well.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sara Murray   </div><div>672 words</div><div>11 January 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Republican presidential nomination race heads to the South, the candidates will get their first taste of battle in states mired in economic downturns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next primary states, South Carolina and Florida, are struggling with housing busts and high unemployment. Times are tougher there than in Iowa and New Hampshire, which have much healthier economies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Carolina will be the first economically distressed state where front-runner Mitt Romney's campaign platform of rebooting the economy and shrinking government spending will be tested. "It frightens me to see a president who has made so many mistakes when people were hurting so badly," Mr. Romney said at a recent campaign stop in Rochester, N.H.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unemployment rate in the state, 5.2% in November, the latest month for which the data are available, was the fourth-lowest in the country. Iowa had 5.7% joblessness in November, also well below the national rate, which was 8.5% in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I want to have a president, and I hope I'm that guy, who will go to work to put Americans back to work with rising incomes and bright prospects for themselves and for their kids," sad Mr. Romney, who won the New Hampshire primary Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Carolina, where primary voters cast ballots Jan. 21, has a 9.9% unemployment rate. More than half the state's jobless had been out of work for more than six months in 2010, the most recent data available. Home values are depressed and default rates continue to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Florida, which has a Jan. 31 primary, unemployment is 10%. Employment in construction, information services and government is below year-ago levels. The housing market remains one of the weakest in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Floridians are hurting," said Lenny Curry, chairman of the state's Republican party. "They're looking for someone that is going to be focused on opportunity, jobs and the free market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question for Mr. Romney is whether his job-creation message resonates with Southern voters more than the attacks he is facing for his tenure as the head of private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Bain Capital</span>. A Super PAC that supports rival Newt Gingrich is running ads in South Carolina assailing Mr. Romney's Bain record, depicting him as corporate raider who profited by destroying companies and jobs. Mr. Romney's campaign says he created jobs at Bain and his business experience qualifies him to be president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's possible" the attacks are beginning to undermine Mr. Romney's message in Southern states, said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster who is working for a Super PAC that supports another presidential hopeful, Jon Huntsman, whose message also is focused on the economy. "We're still taking about a strongly pro-capitalist, pro-private-sector electorate in the Republican primary in South Carolina," Mr. Ayres said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Romney leads the polls in South Carolina, which has a decades-long history of choosing the winning candidate. His campaign is banking on supporters such as Kevin O'Hare, a 47-year-old Myrtle Beach resident, who can't find work in real estate, marketing or sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I just think we're in some quicksand right now," Mr. O'Hare said. "A lot of the employers are just frozen." Mr. O'Hare blames part of that on President Barack Obama's policies. He sees a "defeatist" attitude in the president but optimism in Mr. Romney, and is encouraged by the candidate's business background.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Bain attacks could create an opening for other candidates. Among those who could capitalize is former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who has been highlighting his working-class roots as a coal miner's grandson and his plans to bring back manufacturing and rescue small towns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Government policy is strangling small-town America," Mr. Santorum said in Salem, N.H. this week. "We're going to give small-town America a chance to come back."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Melodie Warner   </div><div>343 words</div><div>11 January 2012</div><div>12:24</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>.'s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings fell 5.5%, reflecting a weak real-estate market, though the home builder's revenue grew and its margins improved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lennar</span> had seen its revenue decline for more than a year in the worst housing-market downturn in generations, though demand has slowly improved of late. But the company is still competing with bargain-priced foreclosures while elevated unemployment and tighter mortgage standards continue to keep some would-be buyers out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lennar</span> has remained profitable, due in part to its Rialto Investments division, which works out troubled loans. The Miami-based builder said last month it was entering the Pacific-Northwest market by acquiring about 650 finished lots in Seattle and Portland. The expansion is <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>'s first new market since entering Atlanta in early 2010, and it could result in about 200 additional home sales next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the quarter, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> reported a profit of $30.3 million, or 16 cents a share, down from $32 million, or 17 cents, a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue jumped 11% to $952.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast earnings of 17 cents on revenue of $914 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross margin on home sales rose to 19.4% from 17.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home deliveries increased 9% to 3,375 homes, while the cancellation rate was 20%. The average selling price rose 2.1% to $243,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders rose 20% to 3,027 homes and the company's backlog, an indication of future business, grew 35% to 2,171 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As we come to the end of 2011 and head into 2012, we have seen the market start to stabilize, driven by a combination of low home prices and low interest rates," said Chief Executive Stuart Miller. "These factors are reflected in our new orders and sales backlog."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue from the Rialto division doubled, contributing $46.5 million to the quarter's top line.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. I have been transferred, and want to buy a home soon in our new location. I thought my old home was sold, but the deal blew up when the buyer didn't qualify for a loan. Now I'm stuck. Should I continue to try to sell the house, or should I rent it out?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--San Francisco</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. There are upsides and downsides to each scenario. Let's consider each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best argument for selling now is that many people aren't, because they are waiting for prices to improve. That's been damping down inventory levels across the country—at seven months, they're at their lowest level since May 2005, according to Hanley Wood Market Intelligence. But you can bet that supply will rise once the housing market shows steady signs of improvement, perhaps as early as this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, you apparently already have hit a sweet spot when it comes to pricing your property. Since you attracted one buyer, you will likely attract others. By re-listing immediately, you could motivate prospective buyers who had been considering your house—and then "missed their chance"—to make an offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, you will have to make mortgage payments on a vacant house. And, as you point out, you may also be selling for less than you might get in a year or two when prices are expected to rebound (though by the time that happens mortgage interest rates could also be on the upswing, reducing the size of the buyer pool).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now let's look at renting. The best reason to lease your home is to offset your mortgage costs. Depending on how long you've lived there, as well as your expenses, you might even have positive cash flow[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703786804576138651074880450.html]. Or you might find a tenant who wants to lease-to-own, which would save you a broker's commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But renting also has disadvantages. Among them are the fact that you will have to handle maintenance and repair[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203388804576616973111289288.html] from afar, unless you hire a property manager; and you'll have to honor the terms[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204553904577102821966894292.html] of the lease when you decide to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renting out your old home may also complicate your efforts to get a loan for a new one. Lenders want to protect themselves from the chance that you tire of being a landlord and walk away from your rental. So they may require that you have enough money on hand to meet the mortgages for both homes for at least six months, in addition to a down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Considering your eagerness to buy another home soon, I'd say that it makes the most sense to try to sell for a few more months, if you can afford it. Renting is always a fallback. But if you do decide to re-up your listing, take the hardest look at offers from buyers who are pre-approved for loans (that is, a lender has processed the buyer's application and approved it for a specific amount), not just unofficially pre-qualified. Large deposits and down payments are also signs that buyers have the means to seal the deal, so you can move on.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan apartment sales fell sharply and prices slipped in the fourth quarter, but brokers remained undaunted and predicted that a boost in buyers' confidence would stabilize the market in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan sales declined 12.4% in the fourth quarter from the year-earlier period, falling to the lowest level since the summer of 2009, according to a market report to be released Wednesday by Prudential Douglas Elliman. Sales were off more than 35% from strong sales in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But brokers -- who quarter after quarter tend to see the glass as half full -- viewed the slippage as aberrational, the result of a rise in economic uncertainty in the second half of last year before the stock market recovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are getting back to a healthy ebb and flow in our market," said Diane Ramirez, the president of Halstead Property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela Liebman, the president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, said that while activity sagged in the second half of last year, "there was a very big return in buyer confidence in 2011."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deepest declines were in sales of new condominiums, which fell 27% from the same quarter a year earlier, and 45% from the previous quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median apartment price was off by 6.2% to $855,000, according to the Elliman report, with a drop in the median co-op price partially offset by an increase in the price of new condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report put the average price of a Manhattan apartment in the fourth quarter of 2011 at $1.445 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The declines came as a bit of a surprise at a time when sales of trophy apartments costing $20 million or more remained strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate brokers noted that the supply of apartments on the market had been shrinking, especially for new condominiums, which showed the fewest listings on the market in several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hall Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens, said that the Manhattan market "continues to outperform the rest of the nation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't see distress at all," he said. "If you build a good product and you price it with some justification, it will sell."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the sharp decline in condominium sales was viewed as positive: an indication that the supply of new condominiums was declining, despite the fears of a large "shadow inventory" of new apartments that weren't officially listed on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the financial crisis of 2008, some developments were converted to rentals, others were abandoned, and new condominium sales have been strong in some neighborhoods. Now Ms. Liebman said she expected to see spot price increases next year in some neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, an appraiser with Miller Samuel Inc., who prepared the Elliman report said, that so far new condo prices weren't rising, even though much of the shadow inventory has disappeared. He attributed the decline in condo sales to "the mismatch of supply and demand" in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The case for a strengthening market, despite the dismal sales figures, is based on the idea that the market stalled because of temporary factors: a stock market shock in the third quarter and a slowdown of the pace of recovery in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory J. Heym, an economist who prepared quarterly market reports for Halstead and Brown Harris Stevens, said that despite fears of layoffs on Wall Street, finance employment was up slightly during the first 11 months of the year, and any fall in Wall Street bonuses was unlikely to stall sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Things are looking good," he said. "We still have things to worry about, but they are a lot less than they were three years ago."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Daniel Alpert, a managing partner at Westwood Capital, who closely follows the housing market, said that there were many risks to the New York real-estate market that could further drive down prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he expects deep cuts in Wall Street bonuses, and that a recession in Europe would slow growth here and around the world, and hurt the Manhattan market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think we have actually seen the bottom yet," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Mitchell and Kate Linebaugh   </div><div>706 words</div><div>4 January 2012</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2012, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. manufacturing grew at its fastest pace in six months in December, and producers appeared poised to keep boosting output to replenish empty shelves in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management's closely watched index of factory activity rose to 53.9 last month, up from 52.7 in November and its best showing since June. Readings over 50 indicate expansion on the 100-point scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors were cheered by signs that U.S. factories were gaining strength, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 179.82 points, or 1.47%, to 12397.38.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A range of industries showed strength, from automobiles to food and beverage products to petroleum and coal. Economists said details in the report hinted at continued growth, at least in the near term: A measure of new orders jumped to its highest level since April, while 25% of respondents said their inventories were "too low" in December, compared with 19% the month before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It looks better than what most people" have been fearing, said Brian Bethune, a visiting economics professor at Amherst College in Amherst, Mass. He said many businesses' inventories were still lean, as they became more cautious last summer amid fears the U.S. might be near another recession. But with those concerns eased, businesses are restocking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Novelis, the Atlanta-based U.S. subsidiary of Indian aluminum maker <span class="companylink">Hindalco Industries Ltd</span>., is one of the companies rushing to boost output. The company, which has 30 plants in 11 countries, is in the midst of a three-year program to increase capacity by roughly a third.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Novelis Chief Executive Phil Martens said, "We're going to continue to expand where we see long-term, indigenous, organic growth." The company is benefitting from the trend of auto makers using more aluminum to make cars lighter and increased demand for aluminum beverage cans in emerging economies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stronger demand is translating into jobs. Within the report from the Institute for Supply Management, a measure for hiring jumped to 55.1 in December, up from 51.8 in November. That tracks with other recent gains in the broader jobs market. The U.S. unemployment rate dropped in November to 8.6% from 9% the previous month, as hiring by private employers offset job cuts by state and local governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American International Manufacturing Co., a Woodland, Calif., maker of conveyor systems and other food-processing equipment, recently hired three fabricators to respond to an uptick in sales, bringing the staff to 33.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm has had more orders from factories overseas, including in emerging markets such as Chile, said Leslie Besseghini, company vice president. The agriculture industry "is good and the U.S. dollar is weak," she said. "People are building plants where before they were sending their walnuts out to be processed somewhere else."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, manufacturing reports from many other parts of the world remained mixed. China and Japan both notched slight expansions in manufacturing during December, after contracting in both nations in November. Most of Europe, meanwhile, saw manufacturing continue to contract in December -- but at a slower pace than in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brad Holcomb, who heads the Institute for Supply Management's survey, said U.S. companies remain cautious about where to invest but are hiring to respond to increased demand, lest they risk losing market share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Navistar International Corp</span>. CEO Dan Ustian said his company expected U.S. sales to be up 15% to 20% in 2012 from last year. The Warrenville, Ill. truck maker's sales in China will also increase slightly this year from last, while South and Central America sales are expected to post modest growth. He expects sales in India to rise between 6% and 8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In my mind, the U.S. economy is very durable," Mr. Ustian said. "Freight prices are up. Trucking companies are healthy. Used truck prices -- an indicator for demand on trucks -- are up. All those say to me the economy is pretty resilient."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, construction spending rose by 1.2% in November from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted $807.1 billion, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer Americans are filing new claims for jobless benefits than at any time since the end of the recession, the latest signal that the U.S. economy is ending a year of uncertainty on a positive note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Department of Labor said Thursday that a seasonally adjusted 381,000 people filed for unemployment benefits for the first time last week. That figure was up slightly from the prior week, but the four-week average, which is more closely watched by economists because it smoothes out weekly volatility, fell to its lowest level since June 2008, when the economy was still mired in recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unemployment data, along with other positive figures from the housing and manufacturing sectors, suggest that the economic recovery is once again gaining momentum after nearly stalling out earlier this year. Fears of a return to recession crested over the summer but ebbed in recent months, as statistics have consistently shown the economy keeps growing, albeit slowly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We continue to hear people say that the U.S. recovery is fragile, and that's the wrong word," said Michael Gapen, an economist with <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>. "It's durable. It's just not robust. It's a moderate expansion."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The declining number of new unemployment claims only indicates that fewer people are losing their jobs, not that more people are being hired. Nonetheless, economists said the weekly figures were a positive sign for the December employment report, which will provide a more detailed snapshot of the state of the labor market when released next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other parts of the economy are also showing signs of strength. Manufacturing activity in the Midwest stayed generally steady in December after rising sharply in November, according to a report Thursday from the Institute for Supply Management, a business group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said Thursday that its index of pending home sales rose in November to the highest level in more than a year and a half. The index, which measures contracts to sell existing homes and is considered an indicator of future sales activity, rose for the third consecutive month after falling over the summer, and it was up 5.9% from November 2010. The increase is the latest sign of life in the housing market, following recent reports that home construction is picking up and that sales of both new and existing homes are also on the rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separate reports earlier this week showed shoppers spending more and becoming more confident heading into the new year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some experts cautioned that the economy was sending similarly positive signals a year ago before a series of events -- the earthquake in Japan, the onset of the European debt crisis, and later, the debt-ceiling battle in Washington, among other factors -- sapped much of its momentum. Paul Ballew, chief economist for <span class="companylink">Nationwide Insurance</span>, warned that there are plenty of looming threats this year, too: the continuing crisis in Europe, signs of a slowdown in China, partisan gridlock in Washington and budget cuts in state and local governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The good news is we have some momentum going into the new year," Mr. Ballew said. "The challenging news is we still have some ongoing issues that need to be resolved."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Big Funds Build Case for Housing</span>
</div><div class="author">By Gregory Zuckerman   </div><div>1354 words</div><div>29 December 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big money is starting to wager on housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hedge funds run by Caxton Associates LP, <span class="companylink">SAC Capital Advisors LP</span>, Avenue Capital and <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> have been buying housing-related investments, betting on a rebound. And formerly bearish research firm Zelman &amp; Associates now predicts a housing pickup, as does <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other investors seem to be making the same bet. Shares of home builders are up 30% since the end of the third quarter, as measured by the Dow Jones index tracking those shares, topping a nearly 10.5% gain for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These stocks rallied during certain periods over the past three years, only to fall again when hopes of a housing rebound proved unfounded. However, home builders haven't outperformed the broader market by this much in a quarter since the third quarter of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We turned bullish on housing. A rebound is coming," says Andrew Law, chief investment officer at $10 billion hedge-fund firm Caxton. He expects that home prices and construction will rise in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bulls received ammunition last week when the National Association of Realtors said sales of previously occupied homes in the U.S. rose 4% in November from October, topping expectations. The inventory of previously owned homes listed for sale fell 5.8% to 2.58 million, the lowest level since May 2005. That came on the heels of data that residential construction surged in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing-price bottom is probably in sight," Goldman said in a December 15 report. Housing prices might decline by 3% next year before beginning a rise, Goldman says. The bank predicts gains of 30% over the following 10 years, not taking inflation into account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is too early to declare an end to the housing difficulties that began five years ago and led to trillions of dollars of losses and a global economic downturn. U.S. home prices fell 3.4% this year as of October, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller home-price indexes released Tuesday. Inventories could rise next year if banks move more properties through the foreclosure process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors and market observers aren't convinced of an imminent turnaround. Still, investors try to anticipate economic trends before they materialize. Even some housing skeptics acknowledge that real estate may no longer be the drag it has been on the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm sold that it's a bottom," says James Bianco, who runs Bianco Research, in Chicago. "It's gone from a negative to a nothing for the economy," though it may be hard for the U.S. to grow at an impressive clip until housing ramps up, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bullish stance appears to be a growing view among big-money types. Caxton turned bearish on housing in 2007, but the firm became optimistic over the past three months based on the low number of new homes built in the past few years as household formation rebounded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caxton has scored recent profits buying shares of home-related companies, such as home builders. "My sense is companies see a turn and are positioning themselves for a multiyear rebound," Mr. Law says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SAC Capital</span>, the $14 billion firm run by Steven Cohen, also has been buying housing shares, anticipating a gradual real-estate recovery, according to a person familiar with the situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A $3.5 billion hedge fund run by <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s GSO Capital, which profited betting against housing as the market tumbled in 2008, began buying stakes in <span class="companylink">Beazer Homes USA Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>. in November, as well as certain housing debt, according to people familiar with the situation. The shift partly resulted from an improving outlook for profits of home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though GSO hasn't risked a large chunk of its portfolio on housing, it expects a real-estate rebound to bring significant gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We believe housing is at a turning point, not just because of affordability and improving demographics," says Darren Richman, a senior managing director at GSO. "The inventory picture has cleared meaningfully. It's more in balance than it's been in a long time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, Marc Lasry, who runs Avenue, a $12 billion firm that specializes in distressed debt, started buying bonds of home builders, including <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>., "as a housing play," Mr. Lasry says. He was enticed by their low prices. "We were six months too early," says Mr. Lasry. "But we think housing keeps improving over the next year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behind the investor optimism: Pent-up housing demand, say industry observers. Many younger adults and others have moved in with parents or into apartments. But record-low mortgage rates and improving home affordability could spur them to buy homes over the next year or two. Housing starts have been well under 500,000 a year since the downturn, compared with over 1 million before that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given income and population growth, the longer-term outlook is more optimistic," Goldman said in its recent report, while noting still-high delinquency rates. "Affordability is at record highs, at least for those who can get financing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ivy Zelman, a longtime real-estate analyst who was bearish about housing before the downturn, has been offering clients a different view lately, predicting that rising rents will push would-be buyers to purchase homes. A housing recovery isn't "happening as fast as everyone would like," she says. But there are "a lot of pillars in place to give us some optimism."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bulls have been burned over the past few years predicting a rebound, and any improvement would be from a very low base. Housing data is seasonally adjusted and tends to be quite volatile. And much of November's increase in construction came from apartments, town houses and multifamily developments, a sign of demand for rentals, not home buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The smartest money in the world has been carried out on stretchers betting on a true recovery for housing," says Mark Hanson, who runs M. Hanson Advisors, a research firm catering to hedge funds that argues a sustained rebound is several years away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hanson says too few homeowners have enough equity to enable them to sell homes and buy new ones, something that usually drives housing. He also predicts more foreclosures, short sales and defaults, especially among homeowners who recently modified loans. Mr. Hanson argues that household formation won't grow much unless unemployment keeps dropping, and that mid-to-high-end homes will fall in price next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why some investors, such as Whitney Tilson's hedge fund T2 Partners LLC, remain bears. Skeptics say many people are becoming more comfortable renting, crimping any housing turnaround.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> President William Dudley recently said that while home prices "no longer appear overvalued," it is "unwise to simply assume the market will bottom out at these levels" because expectations of house-declines "can easily be self-fulfilling." He also noted that access to mortgage credit is constrained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some investors are betting the bears are too pessimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Litinsky, who runs JHL Capital Group, a $1.5 billion Chicago-based hedge fund, turned optimistic in the spring when he crunched numbers on household formation and population growth compared with the availability of new and existing homes. He began buying shares of housing-related companies, including <span class="companylink">Louisiana-Pacific Corp</span>., which makes wood products for homes, as well as home-improvement retailers <span class="companylink">The Home Depot Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Lowe's Cos</span>., and home builder <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Litinsky ramped up his buying in the past few months, becoming the largest holder of <span class="companylink">Louisiana-Pacific</span> according to securities filings. About 25% of his portfolio is in housing-related stocks, up from virtually no such shares at the beginning of the year, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've already worked off a chunk of the excess supply and eventually there will be shortages," says Mr. Litinsky, who adds "it's been lonely thesis until a couple of weeks ago."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every so often, an economic columnist is asked: What surprises do you anticipate in the coming year? And the columnist replies, smiling to avoid seeming snarky: If I anticipated them, they wouldn't be surprises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A better question is this: Where is the conventional wisdom most likely to be wrong?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consensus is that the U.S. economy will finish 2011 with a fourth quarter much stronger (perhaps 3.25% at an annual rate) than the third (1.8%) but will grow too slowly next year (perhaps 2.25% in the first quarter) to bring unemployment down quickly. Although the jobless rate fell 0.4 percentage point in November, a decline of nearly 600,000 people, the consensus is that it will decline only gradually, if at all, from today's 8.6%, or 13.3 million people, during 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what could make the year turn out better?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past year and half, the U.S. has been caught in a tug of war. On one side is the economy's natural resilience. On the other are the long-lasting effects of a burst credit bubble and some bad luck -- the oil-price spike provoked by the Arab Spring, the supply-chain disruption following Japan's earthquake. At the end of 2010, the economy's resilience was winning. In 2011, it gave ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest incoming data are encouraging. Initial claims for unemployment compensation, one of the better early-warning signs, have fallen to their lowest level in 3 1/2 years. Consumers say jobs are a little easier to find, another useful indicator. Housing starts and home sales are up. Inventories are lean. And, for what it's worth, the stock market has bounced back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This could be the start of the much-hoped-for virtuous circle. The job market improves. Consumers have more income. Spirits and, more important, spending perk up. Meanwhile, weakening economies abroad keep commodity prices down and limit inflation in the U.S. With mortgage rates low and consumer finances improving, home prices turn up at last. Businesses, flush with cash, expand and hire more readily, offsetting the retrenchment by governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having been burned by premature optimism, forecasters and policy makers are understandably cautious. Recall <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> Chairman Ben Bernanke's talk about "green shoots" back in March 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ask economists at the Institute of International Finance, an association of global banks, to put a number on U.S. growth for the first half of 2012, and they offer 1.75%, very sluggish. But they add: "A solid private-sector domestic expansion [in the U.S.] may at last now be taking hold, and could be the major global upside surprise in 2012."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would be nice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What could go wrong? At the top of every list is Europe. The latest moves there have, in the view of U.S. officials, reduced the risk of financial catastrophe. On Wednesday, Italy managed to borrow for two years at 4.85%, compared with 7.81% a month ago. But the games of chicken between Germany and southern Europe, and between political leaders and the European Central Bank, aren't resolved. Europe is almost surely in recession. When the best hope is that European governments will "muddle through," the risks of something going wrong are high. And Washington hardly offers an inspiring example of democracy in action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the housing market. We're told housing prices are "stabilizing," and maybe they are. But we learned this week that they fell in October in 19 of the 20 cities tracked by the Case-Shiller index. Over the past year, its 20-city index fell 3.4%, on top of the 30% decline in the preceding four years. Wary home buyers, a still-dysfunctional mortgage market and an overhang of foreclosed homes continue to weigh on housing. If prices take another turn down, that could disrupt any virtuous circle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Odds are the consensus forecast for 2012 is wrong. It almost always is. An economic columnist's heart wants to believe the economy will do better; his head tells him it's likelier to be worse.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jeff Bater                And Andrew Ackerman   </div><div>506 words</div><div>29 December 2011</div><div>11:09</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—The housing market showed signs of improvement as the number of Americans signing contracts to buy existing homes increased in November to the highest level in 19 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' seasonally adjusted index for pending sales of existing homes increased 7.3% on a monthly basis to 100.1, the industry group said Thursday. Sales increased in all four regions of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected pending-home sales would climb by 0.5% in November. November's 100.1 level was the highest since April 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR credited the increase partly to pent-up demand from buyers who have been on the sidelines for months and may have previously failed to obtain a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some of the increase in pending home sales appears to be from buyers recommitting after an initial contract ran into problems, often with the mortgage," the trade group's chief economist, Lawrence Yun, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR's pending sales gauge is 5.9% above its level in November 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The sustained rise in contract activity suggests that closed existing-home sales, which are the important final economic impact figures, should continue to improve in the months ahead," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index tracks agreements to purchase homes. A sale is considered pending when the contract has been signed but the transaction hasn't closed. Pending sales typically close within one or two months of signing, and the 7.3% increase in the index suggests sales of previously occupied homes will continue to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the Realtors group said existing-home sales rose in November. Other reports showed construction and sales of new homes increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the signs of improvement were shadowed by data last week showing home prices keep falling. The NAR reported the median price of a home last month was 3.5% below its level in November 2010, indicating a bottom hasn't been reached in a slide that began around four years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling prices tend to discourage transactions in the housing market. In addition to would-be buyers and sellers awaiting a better deal, banks are holding onto foreclosed property. A glut of unsold homes depresses prices. Also, in a self-feeding cycle, falling prices trigger foreclosures by pulling homeowners with shaky finances "underwater," meaning they owe more on their mortgages than the property is worth, leading to still lower prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decline in prices is a problem for the broad economy because many consumers have a bulk of their net worth in their homes and feel less wealthy, and less inclined to spend, when their property values drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower consumer spending, in turn, stymies job growth. Unemployment in the U.S. is high and expected to remain so, which is bad for the overall economy and the housing market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners aren't the only ones slashing prices to sell property these days. The U.S. Navy is taking a huge haircut to get rid of an obsolete air base near Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, the Navy sold 830 acres on the site of the former South Weymouth Naval Air Station to <span class="companylink">LNR Property LLC</span> in a deal valued at $25 million, a steep discount from the $43 million that LNR originally agreed to pay in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the financial crisis kicked in, LNR backed away from the original arrangement because it felt the land had lost value and any homes the company built would be more difficult to sell. Since then, the two sides have been renegotiating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The price we were talking about in 2006 and 2007 didn't really apply anymore," said Kevin Chase, who oversees the project for LNR. "The market shifted and dramatically changed." Even though home prices in Massachusetts haven't fallen as sharply as in other parts of the country, tight lending conditions have made it more difficult for buyers to get mortgages, especially large mortgages in high-priced markets like Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what's particularly noteworthy about the deal is that LNR's $25 million purchase price will be paid with $12 million in cash and debt. The remaining payment comes in the form of a profit-sharing agreement under which the Navy will receive 5% of all land sales that LNR makes to homebuilders on the site. The Navy expects this arrangement to be worth $13 million over the next decade, but the amount could be much less if the project is unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The profit-sharing arrangement "was a major part of finalizing the deal," said Gregory Preston, deputy director of the Navy's base closure office. "Some of the risk was shifted from the buyer to the government."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal was also a major departure from the past. The Navy has completed similar sales without cutting prices at Navy yards in Brooklyn, N.Y., Philadelphia and Connecticut. In those cases, however, the deals were consummated before the property market ran into trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the height of the real-estate boom, the Navy auctioned several marquee California properties that were on the sites of former bases, to developers, for big profits. In 2005, homebuilder <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. borrowed heavily to buy the former Marine Corps Air Station at El Toro, near Irvine, for $649 million. In the El Toro deal, each of the base's 3,700 acres sold for about $175,000, compared to the SouthField deal, where each acre sold for just over $30,000. The developers of El Toro have struggled to get it off the ground amidst a weak housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Navy always looked at the South Weymouth property as a kind of a gold mine, much like their projects on the West Coast," said Jeff Donohoe, a consultant who worked for the local development corporation set up as the intermediate between the Navy and potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor in the Boston deal was a recent change in the federal law surrounding base closures that made it easier for the Navy to discount the property. Before this year, the Navy and other armed forces departments were required to do an appraisal to determine fair market value for a property. In November, the Department of Defense eliminated that requirement in favor of a new type of arrangement, in which the government is allowed sell land at a discount price and share in the profits generated by developers on these land deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LNR envisions building 2,855 homes over several subdivisions, including apartments for senior citizens and two million square feet of commercial space as part of a "transit-oriented development." There is a nearby commuter rail line and the state recently invested more than $40 million in the East-West Highway, a large arterial road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total cost of building SouthField will be about $2.5 billion, and the community is expected to include about 1,000 acres of parks, a $20 million recreation center developed by a former manager of the Boston Red Sox, and a golf course.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos                and Ben Casselman   </div><div>967 words</div><div>28 December 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prolonged U.S. housing bust is threatening to claim yet another victim: the nascent recovery in the labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New data released Tuesday showed just how bad the housing market remains. Home prices in 20 major metropolitan areas fell 3.4% in October from the previous year, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index. It was the 13th consecutive year-to-year decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The job market, by contrast, has finally been showing signs of improvement. The unemployment rate fell to 8.6% in November, the lowest level in more than 2½ years, and recent weekly reports have suggested the trend continued in December. Consumers also remained surprisingly upbeat, according to a report released Tuesday. The Conference Board, a private research group, said its index of consumer confidence jumped in December to its highest level since April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now some economists fear the continued slump in housing could short-circuit the recovery in jobs by making it harder for Americans to relocate to find work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In theory, as the economy improves, people tend to relocate from places where jobs are scarce to areas where companies are hiring. In the current cycle, that means families should be leaving California and Nevada and heading to Nebraska and Texas. Workers with particular skills, such as machinists, accountants or computer programmers, should move to places where those skills are in demand. That would shrink the big pools of unemployed workers in hard-hit areas and help resolve shortages of skilled workers that have held companies back from expanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some relocation continues, economists believe mobility overall has been muted in part because of the housing bust. Low home values have made it much harder for Americans to move because selling a home is so difficult. That is especially true for the 10.7 million Americans—or 22% of homeowners with a mortgage—who owed more than their homes were worth as of the end of September, according to figures from real-estate firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>. In hard-hit markets such as Phoenix and Las Vegas, the share of such "underwater" mortgages is much higher, at about 52% and 61%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers who are underwater are about 30% less likely to move than those who rent or have equity in their homes, according to a study co-authored by Joseph Gyourko, a professor of real-estate finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have generally found that the housing slump has had only a minor effect on the job market until now. That's likely because with unemployment so high across the country, there are generally plenty of unemployed workers already nearby to fill any available jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that could change as the labor market springs back to life. There are some parts of the country "that people should be thinking of moving to, but they're locked into their current housing situation," said Kenneth Rosen, a housing economist at the University of California, Berkeley. "This becomes a bigger problem as the recovery starts to gain some traction. It's a big issue, bigger than people think."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weak real-estate market doesn't just discourage unemployed workers from moving to find work. It also makes people who do have jobs less likely to relocate for a promotion or a better opportunity in another city, and therefore less likely to open up jobs in the cities they leave behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Randy Badia, an engineer for an auto maker, is ready to apply for a promotion to his firm's Michigan headquarters, but he can't easily relocate because he owes more than his Phoenix home is worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'd like to go back and attack my career aspirations, but being underwater, is it feasible at this point or am I stuck here?" said Mr. Badia, 35 years old, who six months ago passed up a job posting. He owes about $100,000 more than the house he bought six years ago is now worth. "If I didn't have the house, I'd be gone, moving on with my career," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Badia has considered a short sale, where his lender would have to agree to sell the house for less than what he owes. But that isn't guaranteed to wipe out the $70,000 second mortgage he has on the property. He said he has nearly ruled out renting out the house because he doesn't want to be a landlord from 2,000 miles away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of people here are simply staying put," said Greg Markov, the Phoenix real-estate agent advising Mr. Badia. Underwater mortgages "have become a big deterrent to changing jobs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The issue is increasingly a problem for employers as they ramp up hiring. The extended downturn has made it harder to get both job candidates and existing employees to relocate, said David Barlow, senior vice president and senior consultant at moving company Sirva Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Without a doubt, it is magnitudes more difficult to get folks to move," Mr. Barlow said. A job candidate's housing and equity situation "is one of the first questions that comes up" in a relocation discussion, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response, some companies are offering increased benefits, which cover the cost of selling a house for less than the purchase price, according to a survey by <span class="companylink">Weichert Relocation Resources Inc</span>. But as the cost of such benefits rise, companies are also being more selective. Expensive moving costs more often may "lead companies to consider Candidate B or Candidate C," Mr. Barlow said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumer spending inched up in November amid small income gains, helping the lackluster economy close 2011 on a slightly stronger note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said Friday personal spending and income each grew 0.1% in the month, compared with October, less than economists expected. The small spending increase conflicted with other data that have suggested holiday sales were robust, and signaled more sluggishness for the recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Unless consumers start spending more, the firming in the labor markets we have seen will not accelerate, and we really need more jobs to be added if growth is to pick up," said Joel Naroff, the president of Naroff Economic Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Income after taxes and adjusted for inflation, or real disposable income, was flat in November, after a 0.3% increase in October. That restrained Americans' ability to spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many households are still struggling to make ends meet, even though gasoline prices have been falling and many other prices are increasing at a much slower pace," said Chris G. Christopher Jr., senior principal economist at IHS Global Insight. "Personal spending has been relatively weak and would be considerably weaker if auto sales were not coming on like gangbusters."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The saving rate was broadly unchanged as Americans spent the extra income they earned in November. The personal saving rate stood at 3.5%, compared with 3.6% in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most economists think the economy sped up in the final months of 2011, it faces a variety of obstacles, including a high unemployment rate in the U.S. and Europe's debt crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another Commerce Department report Friday showed manufacturers' orders for goods designed to last at least three years rose 3.8% last month to a seasonally adjusted $206.99 billion. A 73% climb in orders for nondefense aircraft drove the overall increase. Demand fell for some other goods, including computers and electrical equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In still another report, the U.S. said sales of new homes climbed for a third-straight month in November. But the median price of a home fell 2.5% from a year earlier. Uncertainty about prices discourages people from buying and selling, and declining home values make people feel less wealthy -- both obstacles to faster economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales amount to about a quarter of their peak before the bubble began deflating around five years ago. Sales are significantly below healthy levels, considered to be an annual rate of about 750,000.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel </div><div>1202 words</div><div>23 December 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A21</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite sluggish sales in the rest of the Manhattan apartment market, demand for New York's most-expensive trophy properties has been soaring, drawing multimillionaire buyers from around the world and even some at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say that there is a shortage of trophy apartments -- those with unrivaled views and features and international bragging rights -- that has driven prices on some properties far above levels seen during the real-estate boom, at least on a per-square-foot basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest trophy example came this week, when a Russian billionaire, Dmitry Rybolovlev, issued a statement saying his 22-year-old daughter, Ekaterina, a student, was in contract to buy one of the best-known apartments in New York: the sprawling penthouse with a wrap-around terrace at 15 Central Park West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment was owned by Sanford I. Weill, the former chairman and chief executive of <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>., who said he would donate the proceeds to charity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weill decided to list the 6,744-square-foot penthouse on the 20th floor at $88 million last month, a breathtaking price for the New York market, where the previous high sale had been a $53 million townhouse sale back in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But within a few weeks, brokers at Brown Harris Stevens abruptly called off showings of the apartment, signaling that a buyer had made a high offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contract price, according to a person familiar with the transaction, was the full asking price of $88 million. A spokeswoman for Brown Harris Stevens declined to comment on the matter, citing a confidentiality agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers who work with very high-end buyers say their business has been busy right through December, and they could sell much more if a larger supply of apartments was available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealthy Russian buyers, who once looked mainly to London for second homes, are particularly active in the Manhattan market at the moment, which is a time of rising political uncertainty in Russia, brokers and lawyers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far this year, seven sales have been recorded for $30 million or more, city property records show, with the highest apartment being a $48 million purchase at the Plaza Hotel. The buyer was another Russian, Igor Krutoy, a composer and music promoter, who made a fortune with investments in Russian media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not counting the Weill penthouse deal, the number of closed sales at or above $30 million recorded to date is the highest since 2008, when there were 21 such sales, and the third-highest totals on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the boom years, it was news when an apartment hit $6,000 a square foot. By this measure, the trophy market is higher than ever. The Weill sale at the full asking price works out to $13,048 a square foot, topping the previous high sale at $9,940 a square foot in the same building a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An $88 million sale gives hope to sellers of expensive homes everywhere, especially to the owners of the seven Manhattan apartments and houses currently listed for more than $40 million, according to StreetEasy.com. A $90 million asking price on a 35-foot-wide mansion on East 80th Street that has lingered on the market since March suddenly seems a bit less out of range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The high end seems to have no end of an appetite for top quality -- similar, but not quite at the very peak of the market," said Kirk Henckels, director of private brokerage at <span class="companylink">Stribling &amp; Associates</span>. "The super rich have re-entered the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elizabeth Sample, a broker at <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> who has represented Mr. Rybolovlev in the past, said that with the top of the market "incredibly active," apartment owners have turned down offers at "around $10,000 a square foot" at the condominiums at the Time Warner Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the overall Manhattan market has been mostly flat over the past year or so, with little change in sight. Mr. Henckels said that even in the $5 million price range, a price tag out of reach for all but a tiny percentage of New Yorkers, may be weakened by the specter of shrinking bonuses on Wall Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc., said the Weill apartment sale was "not a proxy for the New York City housing market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It just means that you've got a tremendous amount of wealth moving around right now, and apparently New York is seen as safe," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the deal on the Weill apartment could lead to other significant sales. In the past, he said, a big trophy sale, has convinced the owners of other top properties to test the waters by putting their apartments on the market, and eventually leading to a cluster of high-priced sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rybolovlev, 44 years old, was ranked 14th on Forbes list of Russian billionaires earlier this year with a fortune put at $9.5 billion. Trained as a doctor, he eventually took control of OAO <span class="companylink">Uralkali</span>, a large producer of fertilizer from potash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rybolovlev sold most of his stake in the company last year and the remaining holdings in April. He now spends most of his time in Monaco. He is in discussions to purchase the Monaco Football Club.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, Mr. Rybolovlev paid $95 million for a 33,000-square-foot ocean-front mansion in Palm Beach, Fla., for $95 million, a record in Palm Beach. He purchased the mansion from Donald Trump, who paid $41.4 million for it in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Palm Beach property has now become caught up in divorce proceedings between Mr. Rybolovlev and his wife in Switzerland, court records show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, a spokesman for Mr. Rybolovlev, Alan Basiev, said that a company "associated with" his daughter had signed the purchase contract for the Weill apartment. Ms. Rybolovleva was born in Russia and has lived in Switzerland and Monaco for 15 years, it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Ms. Rybolovleva is currently studying at a U.S. university, the statement said. "She plans to stay in the apartment when visiting New York."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several brokers who work with Russian buyers said Russian billionaires have recently faced a spate of criticism in Russia for moving capital out of the country and making extravagant investments abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a young student who has lived abroad most of her life, Ms. Rybolovleva, is unlikely to face such criticism, they said. Asked about the details of the transaction, Mr. Basiev said: "Mr. Rybolovlev does not consider it appropriate to discuss the purchase made by his daughter."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward Mermelstein, a lawyer who works with many real-estate buyers in New York from Russia and the former Soviet Union, said that London had been the destination of choice for many Russian buyers, but is "no longer as attractive as it once was."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mermelstein cited concerns over visa delays in Britain and tension in recent years between Russia and Britain following the poisoning death of a Kremlin critic, Alexander Litvinenko, in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were also financial concerns as well: Prices were 50% to 60% higher in London on similar properties, he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SELLER: Jim Griffin. Mr. Griffin is the owner of Aspen Construction, a builder of commercial and residential properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NEIGHBORHOOD: Casa Rodena Winery is just over a mile away. It's about a five-minute drive to Fourth Street, with its antique dealers, vintage stores and flea markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT HE PAID: Mr. Griffin estimates he paid about $400,000 for the lot -- one of several in the area once owned by race-car driver Al Unser Jr. -- and spent $1.6 million constructing the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHY HE'S SELLING: Mr. Griffin says he built the home with the intention of selling immediately, but delayed when the housing market took a turn for the worse. Now that the local market is slowly recovering, he says he's ready to try to sell the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT HE'LL MISS: "Feeling like I'm coming home to a resort," says Mr. Griffin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT HE WON'T: Having a large formal living room and a smaller family room, where guests tend to congregate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTHERS SAY: Tracy Venturi of Keller Williams has shown the house and says the price is appropriate considering the home's size and location in a high-end neighborhood. "It's a really desirable area near the Rio Grande," she says. Joan Wagner of Prudential New Mexico properties has the listing and says that the extensive entertaining and recreation spaces justify the price. "It has more features than any home I've ever been in," says Ms. Wagner, adding that at least one potential buyer has considered purchasing the home and turning it into a corporate retreat.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite sluggish sales in the rest of the Manhattan apartment market, demand for New York's most-expensive trophy properties has been soaring, drawing multimillionaire buyers from around the world and even some at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say that there is a shortage of trophy apartments—those with unrivaled views and features and international bragging rights—that has driven prices on some properties far above levels seen during the real-estate boom, at least on a per-square-foot basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest trophy example came this week, when a Russian billionaire, Dmitry Rybolovlev, issued a statement saying his 22-year-old daughter, Ekaterina, a student, was in contract to buy one of the best-known apartments in New York: the sprawling penthouse with a wrap-around terrace at 15 Central Park West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment was owned by Sanford I. Weill, the former chairman and chief executive of <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>., who said he would donate the proceeds to charity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weill decided to list the 6,744-square-foot penthouse on the 20th floor at $88 million last month, a breathtaking price for the New York market, where the previous high sale had been a $53 million townhouse sale back in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But within a few weeks, brokers at Brown Harris Stevens abruptly called off showings of the apartment, signaling that a buyer had made a high offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contract price, according to a person familiar with the transaction, was the full asking price of $88 million. A spokeswoman for Brown Harris Stevens declined to comment on the matter, citing a confidentiality agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers who work with very high-end buyers say their business has been busy right through December, and they could sell much more if a larger supply of apartments was available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealthy Russian buyers, who once looked mainly to London for second homes, are particularly active in the Manhattan market at the moment, which is a time of rising political uncertainty in Russia, brokers and lawyers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far this year, seven sales have been recorded for $30 million or more, city property records show, with the highest apartment being a $48 million purchase at the Plaza Hotel. The buyer was another Russian, Igor Krutoy, a composer and music promoter, who made a fortune with investments in Russian media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not counting the Weill penthouse deal, the number of closed sales at or above $30 million recorded to date is the highest since 2008, when there were 21 such sales, and the third-highest totals on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the boom years, it was news when an apartment hit $6,000 a square foot. By this measure, the trophy market is higher than ever. The Weill sale at the full asking price works out to $13,048 a square foot, topping the previous high sale at $9,940 a square foot in the same building a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An $88 million sale gives hope to sellers of expensive homes everywhere, especially to the owners of the seven Manhattan apartments and houses currently listed for more than $40 million, according to StreetEasy.com. A $90 million asking price on a 35-foot-wide mansion on East 80th Street that has lingered on the market since March suddenly seems a bit less out of range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The high end seems to have no end of an appetite for top quality—similar, but not quite at the very peak of the market," said Kirk Henckels, director of private brokerage at <span class="companylink">Stribling &amp; Associates</span>. "The super rich have re-entered the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elizabeth Sample, a broker at <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> who has represented Mr. Rybolovlev in the past, said that with the top of the market "incredibly active," apartment owners have turned down offers at "around $10,000 a square foot" at the condominiums at the Time Warner Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the overall Manhattan market has been mostly flat over the past year or so, with little change in sight. Mr. Henckels said that even in the $5 million price range, a price tag out of reach for all but a tiny percentage of New Yorkers, may be weakened by the specter of shrinking bonuses on Wall Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc., said the Weill apartment sale was "not a proxy for the New York City housing market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It just means that you've got a tremendous amount of wealth moving around right now, and apparently New York is seen as safe," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the deal on the Weill apartment could lead to other significant sales. In the past, he said, a big trophy sale, has convinced the owners of other top properties to test the waters by putting their apartments on the market, and eventually leading to a cluster of high-priced sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rybolovlev, 44 years old, was ranked 14th on Forbes list of Russian billionaires earlier this year with a fortune put at $9.5 billion. Trained as a doctor, he eventually took control of OAO <span class="companylink">Uralkali</span>, a large producer of fertilizer from potash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rybolovlev sold most of his stake in the company last year and the remaining holdings in April. He now spends most of his time in Monaco. He is in discussions to purchase the Monaco Football Club.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, Mr. Rybolovlev paid $95 million for a 33,000-square-foot ocean-front mansion in Palm Beach, Fla., for $95 million, a record in Palm Beach. He purchased the mansion from Donald Trump, who paid $41.4 million for it in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Palm Beach property has now become caught up in divorce proceedings between Mr. Rybolovlev and his wife in Switzerland, court records show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, a spokesman for Mr. Rybolovlev, Alan Basiev, said that a company "associated with" his daughter had signed the purchase contract for the Weill apartment. Ms. Rybolovleva was born in Russia and has lived in Switzerland and Monaco for 15 years, it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Ms. Rybolovleva is currently studying at a U.S. university, the statement said. "She plans to stay in the apartment when visiting New York."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several brokers who work with Russian buyers said Russian billionaires have recently faced a spate of criticism in Russia for moving capital out of the country and making extravagant investments abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a young student who has lived abroad most of her life, Ms. Rybolovleva, is unlikely to face such criticism, they said. Asked about the details of the transaction, Mr. Basiev said: "Mr. Rybolovlev does not consider it appropriate to discuss the purchase made by his daughter."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward Mermelstein, a lawyer who works with many real-estate buyers in New York from Russia and the former Soviet Union, said that London had been the destination of choice for many Russian buyers, but is "no longer as attractive as it once was."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mermelstein cited concerns over visa delays in Britain and tension in recent years between Russia and Britain following the poisoning death of a Kremlin critic, Alexander Litvinenko, in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were also financial concerns as well: Prices were 50% to 60% higher in London on similar properties, he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos and Conor Dougherty   </div><div>632 words</div><div>22 December 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing slump was deeper than initially estimated but new data indicate that the worst of the downturn may have passed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said Wednesday it overestimated home sales by 14.3% between 2007 and 2010, meaning that 2.9 million fewer homes sold during those years than thought earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade group, which tracks previously owned homes, said the overcounting was due to shifts in the housing market that weren't detected until this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the report also provided fresh signs that housing is improving. Home sales in November rose 4% from October's levels to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.42 million, the second-highest level of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current rate, sales are on track to exceed last year's depressed level of 4.19 million. While that would be an improvement, sales remain lower than at any time since the late 1990s and are well below the annual level of five million units seen before the housing boom of the mid-2000s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are not expecting to see a housing market that could be described as strong. But despite the downward revisions to sales, a modest recovery may be under way," said Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics. Prices could stop falling next year, he said, but it will take until 2014 for markets to show sustained gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' report showed that housing inventory declined to 2.58 million in November, down 18.1% from one year ago to the lowest level since the spring of 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low inventory is normally a sign of health for housing markets because reduced competition can result in higher prices. But real-estate agents say markets are stalled now because sellers aren't willing to reduce prices further and are keeping their homes off the market rather than settling with buyers seeking deep discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers, meanwhile, remain frustrated by inventory that they say is unattractive or overpriced. A shortage of inventory has "caused buyers to go away," said Ron Leis, a real-estate agent in Sacramento, Calif. "It's our biggest issue right now. They lose interest because there just isn't anything to buy" that meets their requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrena Crawford, a 68-year-old retired civil servant, has long wanted to sell her Kissimmee, Fla., property but won't accept the $100,000 or so she thinks it would fetch right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and her husband bought the home, where they live during the winter, in 1994 for $106,000. During the boom, the property's value rose as high as $200,000, Ms. Crawford says. She hopes to get $160,000 for it and recently met with a real-estate agent to gauge the market. "He's advised us that if we're not in a hurry to hang on a bit," said Ms. Crawford. "As long as I can cover myself (with renters), I'm happy to let it run."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in inventory could be temporary because millions of homes are expected to go into foreclosure. Analysts at <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> estimate that 3.4 million mortgages are in some stage of foreclosure or have gone more than three months without a payment. Banks have been slow to repossess these homes after foreclosure-processing abuses surfaced last year, but the inventory could rise as banks begin to take back and list more of those properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors group typically revises home-sales data every 10 years because its estimates are benchmarked to sales figures from the decennial census. But this year the NAR began contemplating a downward revision after real-estate groups pointed out potential flaws in the tally.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction surged in November, sparking cautious hope that the U.S. housing market is gaining traction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts hit a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 685,000 units, the highest level in 19 months, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts in November were up 9.3% from October and 24.3% ahead of the November 2010 figure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While those gains are sizable, starts remain well below the one million to 1.5 million annual pace needed for a healthy market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The upshot is that, while the latest figures are very encouraging, we aren't getting too carried away about the prospects for home building," Paul Diggle, an economist at Capital Economics, wrote about the data. "Housing starts will continue to improve, but they may not return to the one million mark until 2015 at the earliest."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of November's increase came from the construction of apartments, town houses and other multifamily developments, evidence that rising demand for rental housing has encouraged developers to begin building again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts of residential developments with two or more units saw a 25.3% increase, while starts of single-family homes, which make up about 65% of the housing market, rose 2.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing data also show that newly issued building permits, a gauge of future construction, climbed 5.7% from a month earlier to an annual rate of 681,000, the highest since March 2010. Economists had expected permits to have fallen in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Architecture Billings Index, another indicator of future construction, also rose last month. The index stood at 52 in November, up from 49.4 in October. Readings above 50 indicate a rise in billings. The American Institute of Architects, which compiles the index, indicated that the gain is almost entirely due to billings related to residential construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift to multifamily units is leading some developers that specialize in single-family houses to adapt to the changing market. <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>. all have recently built or started multifamily projects. Many smaller builders also are entering the apartment industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Lakewood Ranch, a 30,000-acre planned community between Sarasota and Bradenton, Fla., developers built 7,000 homes during the housing boom. Residential construction ground to a halt in 2006 as the market started to weaken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eight months ago, building began anew, but with a focus on rental units. The project currently has a 277-unit apartment building under construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The apartments will fill up very rapidly because they're in demand at the moment," said Rex Jensen, chief executive of the company developing the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not as easy to get a home as it used to be," Mr. Jensen added. "There are credit issues for buyers. Also, from an infrastructure standpoint, it's cheaper to invest in an apartment building than in a sprawling subdivision."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several economists saw Tuesday's numbers as great news for apartment builders and pointed to the shift as a promising augury for the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The next 'boom' in residential construction is under way, especially in the South and West, but it is in multifamily rather than single-family homes," wrote Steve Blitz, senior economist with ITG Investment Research. "With the return to rationality in mortgage lending one can think of this as the beginning of a long overdue reversion to the mean."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fayetteville, N.C., developer Chris Cates, who constructs single-family houses and apartment buildings, primarily for military personnel and their families, said it has been a banner year for apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our occupancy rates are great. Right now it's good, to the point that I'm almost worried about the [apartment] market getting oversaturated," Mr. Cates said. "With housing versus apartments, whenever one gets cold, one gets hot, and everyone shifts to what's hot."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK—Oil futures jumped after the latest report on U.S. housing starts showed home building surging well past expectations, in a positive sign for the U.S. economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market was also watching news of unrest in an oil-producing province of Kazakhstan and a meeting of world leaders in Rome to consider sanctions on Iran's oil exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Light, sweet crude for January delivery climbed $3.34, or 3.6%, to settle at $97.22 a barrel on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>. Brent crude on the ICE Futures Europe exchange was up $2.92, or 2.8%, to $106.56 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Volume was far below average because of the holiday season. The January <span class="companylink">Nymex</span> contract expires at the end of trading Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts and traders said the market was bouncing back from an oversold condition earlier in the week as market sentiment has improved about Europe's financial stability and the U.S. economic recovery. U.S. stocks also surged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It does seem that the fears that bubbled up to the surface last week have subsided a bit," said Gene McGillian, a broker and analyst with Tradition Energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said housing starts increased 9.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 685,000, the highest level in 19 months. Economists expected a rise of 0.3%. Stocks rose as the market opened, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rocketing 149 points in the first minute of trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Kazakhstan, the government declared a state of emergency in the Caspian oil town of Zhanaozen after clashes between laid-off oil workers and security forces during an anti-government protest. Kazakhstan exported 1.5 million barrels of oil a day in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Rome, leaders of 11 nations including the U.S. and Saudi Arabia are meeting to discuss sanctions of Iranian oil exports.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home building climbed to the highest level in 19 months during November and construction permits grew, with most of the increase in housing starts coming from multifamily construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction last month increased 9.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 685,000 from October, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. The results were better than forecast. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expected housing starts would rise by 0.3% to an annual rate of 630,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in November was driven by a 25.3% increase in multi-family homes with at least two units, a volatile part of the market. Construction of single-family homes, which made up about 65% percent of the market, rose only 2.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with the same month a year earlier, overall new-home starts in November were up 24.3%. They were still well below healthy levels, considered to be a pace of around 1 million to 1.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce data showed newly issued building permits, a gauge of future construction, rose 5.7% from a month earlier to an annual rate of 681,000, the highest since March 2010. Permits in November had been projected to fall 1.7% to an annual rate of 633,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is one of the key reasons economic growth in the U.S. has been sluggish. High unemployment, a glut of foreclosures and falling home prices have discouraged consumers from buying newly built homes. As a result, builders kept construction to a minimum during the housing bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the building industry has been getting a bit more optimistic of late. A survey this week showed builder sentiment climbed a third-straight month in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As more people believe they can qualify for a mortgage on sensible terms, pent up demand seems to be emerging," said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, in a note to clients Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the National Association of Home Builders' housing market index, which came in at 21 in December, is far below the reading of 50 that would mean more builders view conditions as good rather than poor. The last time the gauge was in positive territory was April 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> predict U.S. home prices will fall by another 3% through the middle part of 2012 before stabilizing in 2013. After that, they predict prices will rise just 5% over the next five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While new-home sales are 8.9% above their level in October 2010, they amount to about a quarter of their peak before the bubble began deflating around five years ago. Sales are far below healthy levels, considered to be an annual rate of around 750,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department data showed that housing starts rose in three out of four U.S. regions. They surged 53.8% in the Northeast and 22.6% in the West and rose 4.1% in the South. They fell 18.2% in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actual housing starts, calculated without seasonal adjustments, fell to 51,800 in November from a downwardly revised 53,100 in October. Lumber and commodities markets watch those numbers closely to gauge demand.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Inflation Rate Seen Outpacing Home Prices for Years</span>
</div><div class="author">By Phil Izzo   </div><div>722 words</div><div>9 December 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ailing housing market is unlikely to return to health before 2016 and is weighing on the two-year-old U.S. recovery, which finally is showing signs of picking up steam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's according to economists in the latest Wall Street Journal survey, who expect home prices will begin to increase in 2012 but—by an 8-to-1 margin—don't see prices outpacing inflation over the next three years. That means that the value of the largest investment for most consumers—their home—would fail to keep pace with increases in the cost of other items, such as food, clothing and gasoline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economists expect home prices as measured by the Federal Housing Finance Administration will be down 2.7% in 2011, but up slightly next year. They forecast that inflation will remain below 2.5% through at least 2014 after hitting 3.3% at the end of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During previous recoveries, home values held down by recession climbed back. In the 1980s, home prices were outpacing inflation by the first full year of recovery, while in the 1990s that took three years. If the economists' forecasts prove true, the pace of growth in home prices would still be below that of inflation after at least five years of a recovery that began in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, housing has been a driver of recoveries. But the bursting of the real-estate bubble of the 2000s has turned the sector into a drag on growth. An excess supply of homes has held back construction and price declines have weighed on consumer sentiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Expectations for continued home-price appreciation, built upon the experiences of the post-World War II period, set the tone for the strategy to buy a home today in anticipation of capital gains down the road. This ended with the Great Recession," said economists at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the housing market, once stabilized, is expected to contribute to growth, a muted recovery means that it won't add much. The 54 economists in the survey—not all of whom answer every question—expect economic expansion above 3% by 2014, which would be faster than the 1.7% forecast for 2011 but still relatively slow. The unemployment rate is seen coming down slowly from its current 8.6% to 8.5% at the end of 2012 and 7.2% by end-2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economists' predictions reflect a market that is at or near a bottom and showing signs of stabilization. New construction in 2011 is forecast to be mostly steady with a year earlier at around 600,000 homes and climbing to around 720,000 in 2012. But recovery may still be some time away due to several factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"High down payment requirements combined with the legacy of previous house price falls are preventing up to half of all existing homeowners from moving home. And potential first-time buyers appear less interested in the idea of homeownership at all," said Paul Diggle of Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> economists Hui Shan and Sven Jari Stehn last week said their model for home prices indicates a bottom some time in 2012. They note that affordability has improved in recent years, helping the market to stabilize but other factors are preventing the sector from taking off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market remains plagued by enormous excess supply. Despite recent improvements, the homeowner vacancy rate remains well above its historical level, and will take a number of years to return to normal," they wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, there were about 162,000 new homes and 3.3 million existing homes available for sale. That doesn't include what economists call "shadow inventory," such as unlisted homes owned by banks, potential foreclosures and regular homeowners who would like to sell but remain on the sidelines due to depressed prices. The most recent estimate from real-estate research firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> put that number over 1.5 million units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Conditions will not improve on a sustained basis until the backlog of distressed properties is cleared, which will enable the price discovery process to play out," economists at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> wrote. "From there appraisals and underwriting standards will normalize, which should set the stage for a sustainable recovery."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos                and Kathleen Madigan   </div><div>569 words</div><div>1 December 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private businesses sharply increased their hiring in November, adding 206,000 jobs, according to a survey of hiring, and an index of contracts to buy previously owned homes surged in October to its highest level this year, bolstering views that the U.S. recovery is on track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest report by <span class="companylink">Automatic Data Processing Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Macroeconomic Advisers</span> showed the surge in hiring from October. In addition, the October figure itself was revised upward, to 130,000 from 110,000. The November increase was the largest monthly gain since December 2010 and nearly twice the average monthly gain since May, when employment slowed significantly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey is closely watched as a signal of the direction of the government's comprehensive jobs report, due out Friday, although the two reports often diverge greatly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, the economy grew in most parts of the U.S. in late October and the first part of November, the Federal Reserve said in its latest "beige book" report, which is based on anecdotes from business contacts and economists across the U.S. The Fed said 11 of its 12 bank regions—all but the St. Louis Fed—had reported an increase in economic activity since the previous report, on Oct. 19, but most of the districts described the pace of growth as slow or moderate. There were bright spots, such as manufacturing—a force in the early recovery that stumbled this year—but consumer spending increased only modestly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' index of pending home sales, which reflects contracts signed on sales that haven't yet closed, rose to 93.3 in October from 84.5 in September, on a seasonally adjusted basis. It declined by 0.3% in the West but was up by 17.7% in the Northeast and by 24.1% in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reading is the latest indication that falling mortgage rates and stronger economic fundamentals could boost home-purchase demand. The increase in the pending-sales index, which hit a 12-month high on a seasonally adjusted basis, follows three consecutive monthly declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market has been underperforming consistently from the early months of the year," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors. Mr. Yun said the gain is "in line with the various improving factors" in the broader economy, such as job growth, rising rents and falling mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sales gains are being driven in part by falling prices. Home prices remain under pressure because many housing markets must digest a large overhang of foreclosed properties. On Tuesday, the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case Shiller index showed that home prices fell by 0.6% in September from August across 20 major U.S. cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun said it would take several consecutive months of stable sales and continued inventory declines to signal a broad-based housing recovery. Real-estate agents recently have reported higher rates of canceled contracts as borrowers run into problems securing loans or appraisals that allow them to buy at the agreed-upon sale price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given the high degree of cancellations, we should be somewhat cautious about how the actual closing figures will play out," Mr. Yun said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos and Josh Mitchell   </div><div>766 words</div><div>30 November 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices declined in September and are poised for a grim winter as banks step up their efforts to take back and sell foreclosed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices fell 0.6% from August, according to the widely watched <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index of 20 major metropolitan areas, breaking a five-month run of increases during the spring and summer, when higher sales volumes typically firm up prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the third quarter, prices were down 3.9% nationwide compared with a year earlier, a slight improvement from the 5.8% annual decline recorded at the end of June, according to the Case-Shiller National Index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices remain under pressure as the housing market continues to digest high volumes of foreclosed and other "distressed" properties that tend to sell at a discount. Though sales picked up at the end of the summer, analysts said buyers were only closing deals they perceive as a bargain, which could help explain why prices are sliding again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Buyers don't want to tell their friends 'I bought a home.' People look at you sideways. But if it's a foreclosure, they pat you on the back," said John Burns, president of a home-building consulting firm in Irvine, Calif. "People need to feel like they're getting a great deal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices fell in September from the previous month in all but three of the index's 20 cities, with a 1.2% gain in Washington, D.C., and 0.1% gains reported in New York and Portland, Ore. For the year, prices were up in just two markets: Detroit reported a 3.7% gain, while Washington posted a 1% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales tend to slow during the colder months, leading to softness in prices. Even after accounting for seasonal factors, price drops could be even steeper this winter because the "distressed" share of home sales is likely to rise as banks unload more foreclosures. Because banks are much quicker than traditional sellers to cut prices to sell properties, prices tend to fall faster as the share of distressed sales rises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nobody should be surprised by further home-value losses in the remaining balance of this year and into next year," said Stan Humphries, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>., an online real-estate firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A different home-price index, released Tuesday by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>, found that prices in September were up 0.9% from August on a seasonally adjusted basis but were down by 3.7% from year ago. The FHFA index captures mortgages financed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite housing's woes, Americans are feeling less gloomy about the economy, according to a separate report released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board, a private research group, said its index of consumer confidence shot up to 56 in November from 40.9 the previous month. That returned confidence to a point last seen in July, before stock-market turmoil, the U.S. debt downgrade and negative developments in Europe caused confidence to tumble to recessionary levels. A slight dip in the jobless rate last month along with a small decline in consumer prices help explain the improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confidence remains dismal by historical standards, but the new reading is a sign that Americans' spirits over the state of the economy have improved after six months of declines. That bodes well for the recovery, because when consumers feel better about the economy, they are more likely to spend and thus fuel growth. The increased confidence helps explain the sharp rise in retail sales last week from a year ago, as Americans embarked on holiday shopping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One tailwind for housing is that affordability has improved markedly. Prices are down by 31% from their 2006 peak and mortgage rates are around 4%, the lowest in 60 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, economists say consumer confidence could plunge again if the U.S. job and housing markets, as well as the European debt crisis, deteriorate. Renewed home-price declines this winter could further chill housing demand despite more affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage-lending standards also remain tight. Many foreclosed properties are selling to investors scoring even deeper discounts by making all-cash sales, which could add to pressure on prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're in a highly contracted state of credit, plain and simple," said Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc. Improved affordability conditions are "all a moot point if you can't get a mortgage."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans shed more debt over the summer, largely by defaulting, paying down debt and taking out fewer and smaller home loans, according to a report that has mixed implications for the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Household debt in the July-to-September period fell by 0.6% from the previous quarter to $11.66 trillion, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</span> said Monday. The driving factor was a drop in mortgage balances, as foreclosures, depressed home sales and lower housing prices reduced the amount outstanding on home loans. Excluding real estate-related debt, consumer debt rose a slight 1.3% from the previous quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report confirmed that American households continued to "deleverage," reducing their debt burdens since the latest recession, a process that some economists say appears to be coming to an end. Deleveraging ultimately puts households on sounder footing and frees up more money to spend, fueling economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think deleveraging is over except for first mortgages," because the foreclosure crisis hasn't concluded, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. "I think it's a positive sign. It means households are getting their financial house in order and that their heavy debt loads are much less weighty than they were." He pointed out that credit-account inquiries are up, indicating more consumer interest in borrowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Monday's report suggests the foreclosure crisis and moribund housing market are still weighing on the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of new mortgages appearing on credit reports fell 17% from the previous quarter and 24.7% from a year earlier, the data show. New mortgage debt, at $292 billion, was at the lowest level since 2000, the New York Fed said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop was due to several factors. Depressed home values and tighter lending standards by the Federal Housing Administration, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and other institutions have reduced the value of loans taken out by middle-class families. Also, high unemployment and stagnant wages have reduced the pool of potential buyers. And some families that could afford to buy homes are staying on the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report suggested that Americans were still struggling and have further to go in shoring up their finances. The delinquency rate—the amount of debt in some stage of delinquency— ticked up to 10% from 9.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of households remain under a great deal of strain," said Karen Dynan, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. "We've made progress, and the lower levels of debt mean that households have smaller debt burdens to manage every month, and that's good for the economy," Ms. Dynan said. "But the fact that there's more deleveraging to come suggests that the debt overhang remains a headwind to the economic recovery."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European stocks made whopping gains Monday, and the euro rose against the dollar, amid hopes that euro-zone policy makers will take decisive action to tackle the debt crisis and as investors cheered an upbeat start to the U.S. sales season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stoxx Europe 600 index closed up 3.8% at 229.85. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index rose 2.9% to 5312.76, France's CAC-40 index ended up 5.5% at 3012.93 and Germany's DAX ended up 4.6% at 5745.33.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cyclical stocks posted the strongest gains. Late afternoon, the Stoxx Europe 600 autos index was up 6.7%, while the corresponding indexes for banks and basic resources added 5.7% and 4.2%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors took the International Monetary Fund's denial that it was in bailout talks with Italy in their stride, choosing instead to focus on reports that France and Germany are planning a new Stability Pact to try to contain the continuing euro-zone debt crisis. The plans are expected to be agreed by the time of the next European Union summit on Dec. 9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It had been reported that the IMF was planning to provide between €400 billion and €600 billion in financial aid to Italy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, investors took heart from a strong start to the U.S. sales season on Friday, known as Black Friday. Sales were up 6.6% from the previous year. And shoppers spent 9.1% more on Black Friday than they did last year, according to the National Retail Federation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also helping to support the positive tone were generally well-received bond auctions by Belgium and Italy, albeit both were forced to pay high yields in order to attract investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was more good news from the U.S. later in the day, when new home sales figures for October showed a 1.3% rise in October, compared with expectations for a 0.3% decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, many analysts put Monday's gains down to a technical rebound following recent heavy losses, rather than a genuine conviction in the outlook for the euro zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin, said equity markets are oversold enough to expect a decent rebound on any catalyst. "If Mrs. Merkel can get her way on fiscal integration, equity markets could be easily supported by a swing out of bond markets. Indeed, if any of this week's news is better than expected, especially those U.S. nonfarm payrolls, equity markets should enjoy a decent rebound; though, at this stage, it is unlikely to be much more," said Lenhoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time of the European stock markets close, the single currency was trading at $1.3341 from $1.3239 late Friday in New York, while the dollar was at ¥78.08 from ¥77.74.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late in Europe, light, sweet crude for January delivery was up $2.03 at $98.80 on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>. Gold for January delivery was up $26.30 at $1,712.00 per troy ounce late in Europe on the Comex division of Nymex.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales rose slightly in October, but the level of demand is historically very weak because of high unemployment in the U.S. and competition from cheaper existing homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales increased by 1.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 307,000 from a downwardly revised pace of 303,000 in September, the Commerce Department said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast sales would slip by 0.3% to an annual rate of 312,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price in October for a new home was $212,300, higher than the level of $204,200 a year earlier and yet down from the month before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uncertainty in the direction of home prices can give would-be buyers second thoughts, with some of them waiting for a better deal. Owners who want to sell, on the other hand, tend to take their property off the market until prices stabilize -- a trend that adds to inventory in the future and depresses prices further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New homes are, generally, more expensive than previously owned property. People have been especially attracted to foreclosed homes because of the low pricetags.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales amount to about a quarter of their peak before the bubble began deflating around five years ago. Sales are way below healthy levels, considered to be an annual rate of around 750,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year over year, new-home sales were 8.9% above the October 2010 level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because many people have much of their net worth tied up in their homes, the bursting of the price bubble made consumers feel less wealthy and discouraged spending. The economy slumped from late 2007 to mid-2009. It has been trying to recover strongly - but unemployment remains high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the housing sector to recover, the economy needs to create more jobs and housing prices must stabilize. But economists think prices will keep falling because the foreclosure pipeline is long. Falling prices pull more homes "underwater," which means the owners owe more on their mortgages than the property is worth. That leads to more foreclosures and lower prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With builders pessimistic, the number of new homes listed for sale at the end of October was 162,000, which is historically low. That supply would take 6.3 months to deplete at the current sales pace and is around a healthy level. The supply in September was 6.4 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce report said October new-home sales were mixed. Sales rose 14.9% in the West and 22.2% in the Midwest. Sales were flat in the Northeast and fell 9.5% in the South.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As another year of the housing downturn ends, some are wondering if it finally is more advantageous to buy instead of rent, given discounted home prices and mortgage rates near historical lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer not only depends on where you live, but also your personal finances, the stability of your job and what you expect for home prices and rental rates in the years ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, renting has been the better choice, according to recent research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renting was the better move about 75% of the time, according to "Lessons from Over 30 Years of Buy versus Rent Decisions: Is the American Dream Always Wise?" a paper scheduled for publication next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The catch: Renters need to invest all the money they save.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We find that if people don't invest the money, actually about 90% of the time, you're better off buying," says Eli Beracha of East Carolina University, who co-authored the paper with Ken H. Johnson of Florida International University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's because for many Americans, their home has become a sort of forced savings account, allowing them to build savings through home equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, the case for buying a home is getting more compelling for many, according to the report, especially as monthly mortgage payments become more competitive with rental payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are six considerations for those weighing a decision to buy or rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 Examine the housing market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One metric that housing analysts will look at to gauge housing affordability is the price-to-rent ratio. To calculate the ratio, the purchase price of a house is divided by 12 times the monthly rent of a comparable home, says Stan Humphries, chief economist for real-estate website <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hard-hit markets like Detroit and Las Vegas have low median price-to-rent ratios of 5.6 and 8.1, respectively, according to Zillow data. At the other end of the list, it's still expensive to buy in New York and Honolulu, with ratios of 16.1 and 17.6, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is no rent ratio that is the magic number," says Christina Aragon, <span class="companylink">Rent.com</span>'s director of strategy and consumer insights. But in general, "the higher the ratio is above 20, the more you'd need to see a spike in housing values to justify the price that you're paying today. If the ratio is below 15, it might make sense to consider buying rather than renting," she adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2 Consider additional costs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remember, if you choose to buy a home, your mortgage payment may be the biggest cost each month—but it's not the only one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are insurance and taxes to pay, as well as regular maintenance costs, says Richard Green, director of the University of Southern California's Lusk Center for Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3 Look into the future</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After taking stock of what the housing market is like today, you have to do some predicting about what the local economy, including the housing market, will look like in the future, Ms. Aragon says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are jobs coming into the area, or are they leaving town? Is there enough demand for housing that prices will rise over the time you will live there?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, housing prices are still falling, and rental prices are rising in many parts of the country. Nationwide, home prices were down 4.4% in September, compared with September 2010, Mr. Humphries says. Prices may drop another 3% to 5% before bottoming, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4 Look into your personal future, too</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before buying, decide how long you plan to live in the home. If you plan to stay there for 10 years, a drop in value a year after you move in could be balanced out by many more years of price appreciation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you plan to live in the home less than five years, you may be better off signing a lease, Mr. Humphries says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5 Consider your personal finances</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assess whether you have the down payment—and if that down payment would wipe out savings you might need for a rainy day, Ms. Aragon says. "Does having that burden of a mortgage mean you can't do things that are important for your lifestyle like take a vacation or go out to dinner?" she asks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days more than ever, potential homeowners need to consider the stability of their jobs before they take on a mortgage. Also being able to move when you have an opportunity to advance your career may be a compelling reason to rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6 Think about opportunity costs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shelling out 20% for a down payment has its consequences. That money—as well as any money you save by renting instead of buying—could be diverted to another investment vehicle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The down payment that you've lost might have been in the bank earning interest or in a brokerage account," says Mr. Johnson. If you're a great saver, you might be better off renting.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Stronger Lure for Prospective Home Buyers; Owning Continues to Become More Affordable Relative to Renting, but Several Obstacles Prevent Many From Biting</span>
</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos   </div><div>1073 words</div><div>26 November 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices and mortgage rates have fallen so far that the monthly cost of owning a home is more affordable than at any point in the past 15 years and is less expensive than renting in a growing number of cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal's third-quarter survey of housing-market conditions in 28 of the nation's largest metropolitan areas found that home values declined in all but five markets compared with the second quarter, according to data from <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>. Meanwhile, rent levels have risen briskly across the country and mortgage rates, hovering around 4%, are the lowest in six decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, monthly mortgage payments on the median priced home—including taxes and insurance—are lower than the average rent levels in 12 metro areas, according to data compiled for The Wall Street Journal by Marcus &amp; Millichap, a real-estate brokerage that tracked 27 metro areas. It remains less expensive to rent than to buy in 15 cities. But affordability hasn't done much to lift the sagging housing sector because many would-be buyers are unwilling to purchase a home or unable to qualify for a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's one of the most striking developments of the housing downturn," said Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics. "The initial building blocks for a recovery are in place, but the legacy of the recession is really preventing households from taking advantage."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Atlanta, which had the most favorable values for owning versus renting, the monthly payment on the average home was $539 assuming a 20% down payment during the third quarter. By contrast, the average asking rent stood at $840, according to the Marcus &amp; Millichap data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But real estate agents and economists say the trend hasn't boosted demand. That is because affordability alone hasn't been enough to overcome the obstacles in the way of a housing recovery. Some homeowners who would like to move up to larger properties are stuck because they can't sell their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, while the monthly carrying costs on a mortgage are lower than average rents in some cities, home ownership carries other costs—including taxes, insurance, homeowner association dues and maintenance—which may dissuade some potential owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other would-be buyers can't qualify for mortgages because lending conditions are tight or because they don't have enough equity in their current homes to use as a down payments. "The reality of coming up with the down payment and the loan-qualification standards makes things much different than the raw numbers suggest," says Hessam Nadji, managing director of Marcus &amp; Millichap. And even those who may qualify remain skittish about buying property in a market where prices could fall amid foreclosures and weak job growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ryan Young illustrates the point. He is under contract to buy a three-bedroom home in Washington Grove, Md., that will have monthly mortgage, tax, and insurance costs for around $150 less than the $1,900 he is paying to rent a slightly smaller house in Bethesda, Md. He qualified for a 30-year mortgage with a 3.95% fixed rate. Still, Mr. Young says he is cautious about owning his first home with the prospect of future price declines. "Buying a house is not a good financial decision, per se, but we needed a bigger place," said the 35-year-old scientist, "and we don't want to move every couple of years into a new rental."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other cities where owning is now cheaper than renting include Detroit, Minneapolis, Orlando, Las Vegas, Miami, St. Louis, Chicago and Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home ownership is also looking more affordable because after several years of declines, apartment rents will rise by around 4% this year, says Mr. Nadji. He says rents are poised "to pick up even more momentum across the country next year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even cities where it is still cheaper to rent than own have seen big boosts in affordability. In San Diego, the monthly cost of owning a home has averaged around 83% more than renting over the past two decades. During the third quarter, owning was 22% more expensive than renting, according to John Burns Real Estate Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates are a big reason why affordability continues to improve. In 1991, a $1,700 mortgage payment allowed a borrower to take out a $200,000 mortgage. Today, it gets that homeowner a $350,000 loan, a 77% increase in borrowing power, says Dan Green, a loan officer with Waterstone Mortgage, in Cincinnati. At the same time, low mortgage rates aren't spurring sales because few analysts expect rates to rise anytime soon. The Federal Reserve in August said it would keep rates at ultralow levels for two years. In a normal interest rate cycle, "when they go low, they don't stay for very long, and people jump in," said Mr. Dales. "This time, there is no urgency."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordability could continue to improve as prices slide even lower in coming months. Price declines are likely because the share of "distressed" sales, including bank-owned foreclosures, tend to rise in the winter, when traditional sales activity cools. Banks are often much quicker to cut prices to unload properties quickly, which means that the greater the share of "distressed" sales, the more prices tend to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One hopeful sign is that inventories have fallen from their bloated levels of one year ago. All 28 cities in The Wall Street Journal's latest survey saw homes listed for sale fall from one year ago, when markets were reeling with a substantial overhang of properties amid a big drop in demand. Visible inventory was down sharply in several markets, including by almost half in Miami and 40% in Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low inventories have spurred more bidding wars at the low end of the market as investors compete for homes that they can convert into rentals. In Sacramento, it would take just 2.5 months to sell the listed inventory at the current sales pace. Las Vegas has a 4.3 month supply of inventory, according to John Burns Real Estate Consulting. But the potential supply of homes is much bigger because banks have yet to process hundreds of thousands of potential foreclosures.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heavy Sits the Crown</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For China's Land Kings</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the boom years, it seemed the only constraint on growth for China's property developers was how much land they could acquire. Rapacious hoarding earned some the title of land kings. With the correction in China's property market now pushing land prices down, the crown is starting to feel heavy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicole Wong, property analyst at CLSA, says developers China Overseas Land &amp; Investment and Longfor Group have cut the prices of homes by 20% to 25% at projects in Shanghai. A fall in the real-estate market reduces the incentive for developers to invest in new projects, denting demand for land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October and November, land auctions in several major cities failed, with no bidders at some and only low prices offered at others. Prices nationwide for residential land were down 8% year-to-year in October while transaction volumes were down 37%, according to data from property agency Soufun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is bad news for developers, many of which are sitting on large inventories of land purchased near the peak in September 2009. Land prices are volatile, but average prices for October are down 40% since then. Anyone who bought at the top could be looking at significant write-downs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Something similar happened in 2008, when CC Land wrote down the value of its land bank by 12%, and <span class="companylink">China Vanke</span> its land bank by 3.9%, according to calculations by Jinsong Du, a property analyst at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>. It was only the boost from the government's stimulus policy -- kick-starting the real-estate engine -- that saved developers from recognizing bigger losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those sitting on large land reserves are in the toughest spot. Zhejiang-based <span class="companylink">Greentown China Holdings</span>, for instance, says only a tiny fraction of its stock of land gives cause for concern. But a land inventory nine times as big as sales for 2010, according to <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> data, still looks vulnerable if prices continue to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy remains a wild card. If investment drops sharply and growth slows, the government could relax controls on the sector, buoying sales, encouraging developers to break ground on new projects and pushing land prices back up. Barring such a shift, falling sales and land values mean some of China's former land kings could be in a royal mess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">French Bond Pain Spreads</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First French sovereign bonds, now French corporate bonds. Contagion is spreading to a key source of funding for French firms. As French sovereign-bond yields have risen -- with 10-year spreads peaking last week at two percentage points over German bunds -- French credits have increasingly underperformed peers. Although absolute borrowing costs are low, the longer the sovereign-debt crisis continues, the greater the risk of a new credit crunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So long as the crisis was confined to troubled countries along Europe's edges, Europe's corporate bond market could largely ignore it. The 125-component Markit iTraxx Europe credit-default-swap index contains no Greek, Irish or Portuguese borrowers, for instance. But French borrowers account for 18.4% of the index, second only to the U.K. And in the primary corporate-bond market, French issuers dominate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent market moves have been striking. A five-year credit-default swap on France Telecomcosts 173,000 euros, or about $130,000, versus 114,000 euros Sept. 1. During that time, the cost of protection on <span class="companylink">Deutsche Telekom</span> has only risen to 136,000 euros from 113,000 euros. French borrowers are paying up to raise new debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pressure is likely to intensify. Once sovereign credit-default-swap prices break above $150,000 -- a level France breached in early August -- they start to feed through to corporate prices, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> argues. This usually reflects fear of an economic downturn and tighter credit conditions as domestic banks' borrowing costs rise; the current rise may also reflect growing concerns over a break-up of the euro.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporations have some protection. They have raised cash and cut costs. And overall borrowing costs are low, with Auchan's five-year bond carrying a coupon of just 3%. But turmoil in the corporate-bond market may damage confidence, leading to further spending restraint, deeper economic decline, and a renewed drying up of credit. That is a recipe for a downward spiral.</p>

<span class="companylink">KKR</span>, Gas Sector</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Make Great Couple</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If at first you don't succeed, swap sides. <span class="companylink">KKR</span>'s most famous bet on natural-gas prices, 2007's $45 billion takeover of Texas utility <span class="companylink">TXU</span>, bombed. Now <span class="companylink">KKR</span> is buying the gas producers instead. It is a better strategy, mainly because it isn't a straight bet on gas prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">KKR</span>, Crestview Partners and others are buying closely held <span class="companylink">Samson Investment Co</span>. for $7.2 billion. It is the latest in a string of forays into the sector by <span class="companylink">KKR</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far this year, private-equity buyers have accounted for 11% of U.S. upstream oil and gas transactions worth more than $10 million, according to IHS Herold. The average for the prior 10 years was 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exploration and production, or E&amp;P, sector is tailor-made for private equity. Success in finding and cracking open America's unconventional oil and gas resources has left many E&amp;P companies long on resources but short of the capital to develop it all. Many companies have resorted to joint ventures with or outright sales to oil majors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the majors tend to buy assets that are already well developed. They also need big assets to make a deal worthwhile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this is a fragmented industry: The biggest independent producer, <span class="companylink">Chesapeake Energy</span>, accounted for just 3% of U.S. gas output in the second quarter. In addition, private equity can provide capital to E&amp;P companies with less developed assets that aren't yet ready to attract a premium from the majors or the public market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is bridge financing in other words, predicated on expanding the target's resources and output, rather than a bet on commodities. It is also a bet on expertise: Natural Gas Partners, one of the parties to Wednesday's deal, says it has created 15 firms with Samson alumni.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a classic role for private equity. The industry has struggled to find large, profitable opportunities following the bursting of the bubble that included the <span class="companylink">TXU</span> deal. Meanwhile, the investment needed to develop America's unconventional energy resources is enormous. <span class="companylink">KKR</span> and its brethren have good reason to keep returning to the oil and gas well.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OVERHEARD</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confusion reigns in China's monetary policy, but the signs are that the central bank is keeping things titled toward easing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, media said the People's Bank of China had cut the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points for five rural credit cooperatives -- freeing up more funds for lending. A call to the PBOC revealed the cut to the RRR had been for more than 20 rural banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The direct impact of the move will likely be limited. Rural credit cooperatives are small. They are also numerous -- 214 of them at last count. A cut in the reserve requirement ratio for 20 of the 214 is unlikely to move the aggregate monthly new loan numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The significance of the story is in the direction of travel. Taken together with the central bank's move to ease conditions in the money markets, even a small adjustment to the reserve requirement for rural banks signals that the momentum remains toward loosening monetary policy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calabasas, California -- On a recent Friday, about 60 people gathered at a 10,300-square-foot French Chateau-style home in a gated community of this wealthy suburb of Los Angeles. Nibbling on fruit salad and croissants, the visitors meandered through the home's large kitchen, checked out the view of the rolling hills or peeked into the movie theater while it played "Pretty in Pink."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They had all gathered to see this seven-bedroom, seven-bath mansion, which was rented by singer Britney Spears between roughly 2008 and 2010, sell to the highest bidder. The home had previously been on the market for as much as $10.8 million; bidding would start at $4.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm starting to get butterflies," confessed Regina Leon, who owns the home with her husband Jose "Pancho" Leon, a builder and founder of a money-order company. After several of her girlfriends mentioned they were coming by, Ms. Leon had decided at the last minute to cancel her hair appointment to stay to watch the action unfold. Mr. Leon said he wasn't worried, though he admitted he'd gotten only about four hours of sleep the night before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once considered a last resort for desperate sellers or for banks unloading foreclosed properties, home auctions are increasingly being used in the U.S. to sell penthouse apartments, waterfront mansions and grand country estates -- many of them languishing in an uncertain market after significant price cuts. At Premiere Estates Auction Co., founded 10 years ago, the average price of a home the company auctions is up nearly 40% from a year or so ago, says auctioneer Anthony Fitzgerald. Auction company JP King, in business since 1915, has seen inquiries for home auctions above $10 million so far this year double from a couple of years ago, said Craig King, the company's president. In 2010, the company had 11 inquiries for homes above $10 million; so far this year it's had 24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the U.S. housing slump drags on, the carrying costs of waiting out the market have become onerous, even for the wealthiest. A seller who put a home on the market in 2009 hoping that a turnaround was on the horizon may now be realizing that it could take several years or more for the market to rebound. Taxes on a $10 million or $20 million home can run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, in addition to staffing and other upkeep. The ultra high-end of the market is particularly vulnerable: As of September, houses priced at $10 million and above declined nearly 9.5% in value from last year, according to Zillow, the online housing tracker, compared to a 4.4% decline overall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Eventually, even the people who have unlimited means will throw in the towel at some point," said George Graham, the CEO of Concierge Auctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some brokers warn that when a well-known mansion or estate fails to sell at auction, it can become tarnished, making it harder to sell in the future. "If you have all that hype and then it doesn't sell, then you've got egg on your face," said Jeffrey Hyland, president of Beverly Hills-based real-estate firm Hilton &amp; Hyland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Hurwitz, a longtime Southern California broker who recently tried unsuccessfully to auction off a $45 million sculptural-style home in La Jolla known as "the Razor," said he's concluded the process doesn't benefit sellers, who assume all the risk by paying marketing fees up front. (Fees can range anywhere from a couple thousand dollars to upwards of $150,000 for ultra high-end homes.) He said auctions can also turn off potential buyers who don't want to pay an additional 8% to 12% in premiums after the sale, which can amount to a million dollars or more for an expensive home. "It just doesn't make sense," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laura Brady, of Concierge Auctions, said most buyers are aware that all real-estate transactions involve fees, and the premiums are included in auction-sale prices, "just like real estate agent's fees" are in a traditional sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mansions and estates are frequently auctioned for much less than their previous price tags, though those price tags may have been set unrealistically high to begin with. While both Christie's and <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> are affiliated with real-estate companies, neither conducts real-estate auctions in the U.S. (Both have some affiliate agencies that have auction divisions which partner with companies like Concierge and Premiere Estates.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christie's International Real Estate's CEO Neil Palmer said that while such auctions are common in parts of Asia and in Australia, the company doesn't view them as the best way for sellers to get the best price in the U.S., because when sales happen they are "more often than not at a steep discount."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. King from J.P. King, on the other hand, said that U.S. homes generally sell for steep discounts in today's real-estate market even when they're not sold at auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last November, Maureen Coen, who works in fixed income for a financial company, heard about the upcoming auction of a home in her neighborhood in Tuxedo Park, N.Y., one morning and decided to show up. She won the house for $2.3 million -- 75% less than its original list price of $9.8 million. "I got phone calls that weekend [from friends] telling me I got the deal of the century," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A historic New Canaan, Conn., estate with a 16,000-square-foot main house, a carriage house and three-bedroom guest cottage once priced at $22 million is coming up for auction next month with a starting bid and minimum reserve of $6.8 million -- or nearly 70% off. Bronko Terkovich, a real-estate developer and architect in Jackson Hole, Wyo., plans to auction off his property there on Dec. 10. His 10,000-square-foot home was listed for $16 million in 2009; the reserve, or minimum sale price, is just under $6 million. "We wanted it to have a reasonable low-level price to attract the greatest spectrum of possible buyers," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Sheldon Good &amp; Co</span>. last week auctioned the 56-acre Napa Valley estate of the late winemaker and philanthropist Robert Mondavi, with bidding starting off at $13.9 million in a sealed-bid sale; the property came on the market in May 2010 for $25 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the average price of homes hitting the auction block ticks upward, a handful of companies have cropped up to handle such sales. Auction.com, which sells distressed real estate online, recently launched a luxury division. Jeff Biebuyck and Karen Baldwin, two <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> agents who had the Leons' Calabasas listing, are launching an auction division of their traditional brokerage business, as has Jon Kohler, whose Georgia firm specializes in selling multimillion-dollar historic plantation properties in the South. John McMonigle, an Orange County, Calif., real-estate broker known for his trophy-home listings, has spun off an auction division called M Lux Exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Auction companies argue that they can reach a wider pool of buyers than local brokers. They also say an auction announcement can create a sense of urgency that's impossible to replicate in the buyer's markets of today. "In this market, buyers think they can wait three months," said Roger Ewing, the president of Ewing &amp; Associates <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge for these companies is to aggressively market expensive-to-build, sometimes one-of-a-kind homes that will likely sell for steeply discounted prices without making it feel like a fire sale. Mr. McMonigle said his open-house events usually include Champagne and live music. "We want to perceived as that type of luxury experience," he said. "We're approaching it much like <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> would approach the sale of art." Brochures are often sent directly to high net worth potential buyers, or their brokers. Ads are placed online, in national newspapers or glossy luxury magazines in the U.S. and sometimes as far away as Brazil or China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the day of the sale, generally only qualified bidders who have transferred money into an escrow account, or brought a cashier's check, are invited, along with local brokers and, sometimes, neighbors. Hors d'oeuvres are sometimes served along with tea, coffee or Champagne. Concierge says at its Hawaii auctions, bidders are given floral leis. Mr. Fitzgerald of Premiere said that for morning sales, he likes to serve donuts and coffee to energize the crowd. The podium is generally placed to maximize the home's best views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leon said he didn't immediately consider an auction when he listed the Calabasas home for $10.8 million in 2007, after his wife concluded it was too big for their family of five. But after about two years and a price cut to $7.9 million, Mr. Leon decided to auction the home with Premiere. "It's the entrepreneurial way of selling," he said. Regina, his wife, eventually agreed, though she initially didn't like having to explain to neighbors that their home was not in foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With several dozen people gathered around a podium under a white tent, the auctioneer warmed up the crowd, getting them to sing the national anthem (it was Veterans Day) and conducting a mock auction that included bidding on Disneyland (a little girl in pigtails won). Then the bidding for the home began. The minimum bid of $4.5 million was quickly offered. Someone on the phone with an auction-company representative initially appeared to have the highest offer -- $5.5 million -- beating out about four others who showed up in person. After a minute or two of trying to rouse a counter bid from the crowd, the auctioneer banged his gavel on the podium and announced the home had sold, subject to seller confirmation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It hadn't -- $5.5 million wasn't high enough to meet the reserve, the minimum amount the Leons were willing to sell the home for. After most of the crowd had left, a neighbor who had been the runner-up in live bidding negotiated a $5.9 million purchase, including auction-company fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer, Dan Hosseni, owns Pizza Hut franchises across the state. He and his wife, Nancy, walked around the backyard with their 4-year-old daughter (the Disneyland winner) discussing plans to expand the dining room to accommodate their large extended family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a house [my wife] and I are going to grow old in," Mr. Hosseni said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leon said he was happy. "It gives me an opportunity to move forward," he said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOENIX -- The Phoenix housing market is defying conventional economic theory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of homes for sale are low, falling 41% to 21,304 in October, compared to 35,732 at the same time a year ago for Greater Phoenix, according to the Cromford Report, a market research firm in Mesa, Ariz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of home sales is rising -- to 6,428 in October from 5,443 in same month a year ago, according to the Cromford Report. The city's unemployment rate is inching down and is below the national average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The laws of supply and demand suggest housing prices should be rising, or at least stop falling. But they continue to decline, due to a flood of bargain-hunting investors who still dominate the market, as well as conservative bank appraisals. As a result, economic recovery in what was once one of the country's most dynamic cities is being held back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly median price for a previously owned, single-family home in Greater Phoenix sank 5% to $120,000 in October from $127,500 a year earlier. The national median was $165,400 in September, the latest month reported by the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the same time, as prices weakened, unit sales rose 18%, according to the Cromford Report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That compares with a 3.5% decline in median prices nationally on a 12.2% increase in sales in the 12-month period ended in September, according to the latest data from the Realtors group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, median prices here have declined year-over-year for the past 12 months, while the annual change in unit sales has been climbing monthly since last November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The low-water mark for the market came in January 2010, when the median price for a home in the city of Phoenix fell 64% to $92,000 from $253,000 in December 2007, according to the Cromford Report. In October, the median returned to $92,000 in the city of Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Active home listings on the Greater Phoenix market fell to a 3.3-month supply in October from 6.6 months the same time a year ago, according to the research firm. An inventory supply of 4.5 months is considered normal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When inventories fall so rapidly in a market, housing experts say prices almost always rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It defies gravity what's going on here," says Alan Langston, executive director for the Arizona Real Estate Investors Association, an industry trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, there was a 8.5-month supply in September, the latest reporting period, down from 10.7 months a year ago, according to the Realtors group. The consensus for a national housing recovery is at least four years away, according to a September survey of economists, real estate experts and others in the industry by MacroMarkets LLC, an investment banking service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing experts attribute the disconnect in Phoenix primarily to the fact the once-booming metropolis was among the most severely hit markets. Between 2007 and 2010, home prices fell more than in almost any other market. That has prompted a surge in sales over the past year that has largely been driven by investors seeking bargain-basement prices, said Mike Orr, owner of the Cromford Report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Investors are 40% to 50% of the market now and they focus mainly on the bottom end," said Mr. Orr, who added that another weight on prices is what he calls stricter lending standards and low bank appraisals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broker Dan Valentine said that between March and September he paid $1 million on behalf of a group of investors for 16 homes that were valued at $2.7 million before the recession. He recently inspected a 1,480-square-foot house in suburban Glendale once valued at $235,000 that was listed by its bank owner for $75,500. Mr. Valentine placed a bid of $43,750 on it in September but lost out to a bid of $78,880.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Is the neighborhood pretty nice?" Mr. Valentine asked former owner Donna Grannis y cellphone. "It's not bad," said the 46-year-old Ms. Grannis, a single mother of two who later added she fell behind on her $181,000 mortgage. "Things just spiraled down for me."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Valentine's strategy is to buy houses like these on behalf of mostly out-of-state investors and rent them until the market returns. For investors like Gerald Jackson, a retired construction manager in Springfield, Mo., a return of as much as 10% from rent beats many investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's risk, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of risk because these houses are so cheap," said the 68-year-old Mr. Jackson, who in October paid $75,000 for a 2,000-square-foot house in Phoenix whose owner had defaulted on a $168,000 mortgage. The house hasn't been rented yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the nonconstruction economy on the mend, apartment vacancies have eased from 13.3% in December 2009 to 9% as of August, according to a September report by the brokerage firm <span class="companylink">Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broker Joan Levinson said that in July she sold a house in upscale Paradise Valley for $1 million -- but the bank wouldn't allow the buyer to pay more than an appraisal that came in at $925,000. "The seller was not happy," Ms. Levinson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The low prices are putting the brakes on recovery in a crucial economic contributor: construction of new homes. In October, just 339 new homes were built in the Phoenix area compared with about 4,000 in September 2006 at the height of a building frenzy in 2006, according to Information Market, an industry research report in Glendale, Ariz. "We're kind of in this recurring nightmare that doesn't want to fix itself," said Howard Weinstein, principal of Pacific Land Co., a land broker in Scottsdale, Ariz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dearth of new construction is also holding back the recovery of other once-booming southwestern cities such as Las Vegas, where the general economies remain slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lack of home construction is particularly striking in Phoenix, where industries such as technology have resumed their growth, helping Phoenix's jobless rate fall to 8.2% in September from 9% a year earlier, and below the 9% national rate.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos   </div><div>717 words</div><div>22 November 2011</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2011, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes improved in October and are on pace to surpass last year's anemic tally. But prices continued to fall, underscoring the broader market weaknesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors, which released its home-sales report Monday, said sales rose 1.4% in October from a month earlier and were running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.97 million units. That puts sales on track to beat last year's level of 4.91 million units, which was the lowest level in 13 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While sales are improving, they remain weaker than some economists and housing analysts had anticipated, considering that 30-year mortgage rates in September and October fell below 4%, the lowest level in at least 60 years. Median prices, meanwhile, fell to $162,500 in October, down 4.7% from one year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade group said an unusually high number of contract cancellations were partly to blame for holding back the housing recovery. One in three real-estate agents who responded to an NAR survey reported that a sale had fallen out of contract in October. Some contracts are falling through because appraisals come in too low and because would-be buyers aren't qualifying for mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were significant regional differences in the data. In October, sales of existing homes rose 2.8% in the Midwest, 2.1% in the south and 4.4% in the West. But sales declined 5.1% in the Northeast. Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the NAR, said an early snowstorm that took the region by surprise could be blamed for delaying some sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, sales were up by 12.3% from one year earlier, when sales had been depressed by the aftereffects of home-buyer tax credits. Sales dropped sharply in the summer after those tax credits expired. But while the country as a whole was up strongly from one year ago, sales were down by 4.1% in Washington, D.C., and by 0.8% in the New York metro area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun said lower loan limits for government-backed mortgages that took effect on Oct. 1 could have been behind some of the decline in the Northeast, where homes tend to be more expensive than in some other parts of the country. (Congress last week raised those limits back to their previous levels for mortgages eligible for backing by the Federal Housing Administration, but not for <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes listed for sale fell in October to 3.33 million, the lowest level of the year and down by 13.8% from one year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While low inventories are often a sign of health because reduced competition can boost prices, many analysts believe the phenomenon reflects the inability or unwillingness of many homeowners to sell their properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents say more sellers are pulling their homes off the market rather than sell at today's reduced prices. About one in four homeowners with a mortgage owes more than their home is worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report from mortgage-data firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> to be released Tuesday projected that it could take until 2020 for markets to fully digest an overhang of foreclosed properties that represents a "shadow" inventory of potential bank-owned homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> estimates that there are 1.6 million single-family homes in some stage of default or foreclosure that will ultimately be taken back and resold by banks over the next 18 months. Assuming that homes are sold at roughly the same pace that has existed over the past two years, it would take until 2020 for the shadow inventory to decline to the level that prevailed prior to 2005, said Mark Fleming, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>'s chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is going to be a problem for a significant period of time," Mr. Fleming said. But the "silver lining" is that stretching out the sale of bank-owned property over a longer time frame will do less damage to home prices. "If you were to push all of this inventory through the foreclosure process quickly, the housing market as it stands today would not be able to handle it," he said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market is starting to show a pulse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time in a long time, housing figures are coming in better than expected. The National Association of Home Builders' sentiment index jumped three points this month to 20, its highest reading in over a year. Last week, the Commerce Department said building permits and construction of single-family homes rose in October. The Federal Reserve's fourth-quarter loan survey showed a pickup in demand for mortgage loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission accomplished? Not quite. Construction is picking up but remains at historically depressed levels, and broader sales activity is still anemic. Indeed, the National Association of Realtors' existing-home sales report, out Monday, is likely to show a second straight monthly decline in October to a seasonally adjusted annualized pace of about 4.8 million units. That would mean the sales rate has dropped by more than 10% so far this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the foreclosure supply is ticking back up. After declining for three straight quarters, the percentage of loans on which foreclosure action has started rose in the third quarter, the Mortgage Bankers Association's latest survey showed. This was partly due to remediation programs and the sunset of earlier foreclosure halts, the group said. The continued trickle of distressed properties is likely to keep downward pressure on home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all foreclosures are created equal, however, and regional disparities are becoming more pronounced. In states with nonjudicial foreclosures, like California, properties are seized and resold more quickly than in judicial states like Florida, where court hearings can delay this for months, if not years. California's market, having fallen hard and fast early on, is now starting to recover. Florida, which also fell sharply, remains among the weakest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America</span><span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> economists expect the foreclosure process to speed up in nonjudicial states next year, with liquidations peaking in 2013. This is partly why they expect home prices to drop another 8% on average nationwide over the next 18 months before bottoming. This assumes a healthy pickup in sales; if customers shy away because of economic angst or tighter lending criteria, a rebound will take longer to materialize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, six years after existing-home sales peaked, the market is at least edging toward a bottom. The biblical notion that seven years of famine follows seven years of feast may have something to it.</p>
