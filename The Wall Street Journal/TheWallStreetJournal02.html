<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chef: Christina Nguyen</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTO: MICHAEL HOEWELER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her Restaurants: Hola Arepa and Hai Hai, both in Minneapolis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What She's Known For: Fresh takes on Latin American and Southeast Asian dishes. Inventive cooking inspired by her travels and childhood favorites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOME DISHES at Hai Hai, in Minneapolis, pay tribute to foods that chef Christina Nguyen grew up eating with her family, who immigrated to the Twin Cities from Saigon. Others she found later, traveling in Southeast Asia. Banh trang nuong, a relatively recent street-food invention she calls "grilled Vietnamese pizza," is among the latter. "The kids came up with it," said Ms. Nguyen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In her first Slow Food Fast recipe, she spreads rice-paper rounds with a layer of ground pork mixed with egg. With toppings of peas, charred scallions, fried shallots, jalapeños, cilantro and dots of mayo, each bite delivers savory, spicy, fresh and creamy elements. For easy eating, fold the rounds in half, quesadilla-style, and cut into wedges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's been a runaway hit at Hai Hai—but only late-night. "We don't serve this on the regular menu," said the chef. "I'm afraid we couldn't keep up with demand."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ben Eisen </div><div>286 words</div><div>31 May 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates dropped below 4% for the first time since early last year, adding to hopes for a revival in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate this week on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was at 3.99%, mortgage finance giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said Thursday. That marks a fall of nearly a full percentage point from the highs of November. Some lenders have been offering rates well below that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower rates stand to make mortgages more affordable for buyers, and the sharp fall so far in 2019 has lifted optimism for a market that has cooled after years of torrid home price growth around the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower rates should "give a boost to the housing market, which has been on the upswing," said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist, citing home-sales data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in mortgage rates tracks a decline in the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which was recently at its lowest since 2017. Yields have fallen amid concerns about U.S. economic growth and the potential for a protracted trade dispute with China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy has remained relatively strong during the first three months of the year. It grew at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 3.1%, according to data released Thursday. Still, concerns about an economic slowdown could weigh on the housing market, particularly after a mini boom earlier in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Unlike earlier this year, there is no backlog of buyers waiting to enter the market, and a slowing economy is preventing homebuying sentiment from rising from 10-year lows," analysts at <span class="companylink">Capital Economics</span> wrote.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>476 words</div><div>29 May 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth sputtered in March, the latest sign that lower mortgage rates and a booming economy are doing little to boost prices during the critical spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 3.7% in the year ended in March, down from 3.9% the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given the broader economic picture, housing should be doing better," said David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years in which housing costs grew much faster than incomes, home prices are now growing closer in line with wages. But affordability remains a challenge for many buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales and price growth have been steadily slowing for about a year, bucking a strong U.S. economy overall. Economists and real-estate agents were hopeful that a drop in mortgage rates of nearly a percentage point over the past six months would help drive demand for homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the market has continued to slow. Existing home sales posted their 14th straight month of annual declines in April, falling 4.4% since April 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Compared with previous snapback in mortgage rates, it hasn't been nearly the impact or the response by buyers or sellers that we would have expected," said Zillow economic analyst Matthew Speakman. "It's a bit perplexing given the strength of the economy."'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">West Coast markets, where prices rose at a frenzied pace for more than five years, have slowed the most sharply over the past year. A year ago both Seattle and San Francisco were seeing double-digit annual price gains. Today, prices in both places are growing just over 1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's where a lot of the stress was and it propagated out to the rest of the country," said Sam Khater, chief economist at Freddie Mac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The markets now driving price growth are places that remain below their pre-2008 peaks. Las Vegas had the fastest home-price growth in the country for the 10th straight month, at 8.2%. Phoenix had the second-fastest price growth at 6.1%, followed by Tampa, Fla., at 5.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not just a few West Coast markets driving the slowdown, however. Only four out of 20 cities saw an acceleration in price growth in March compared with February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said they expect to see price increases stabilize and even improve slightly in the coming months, as the effect of lower mortgage rates and better wages trickles further into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've already seen prices stabilize in our data the past couple of months and we've started to see a mild improvement in some of the Western markets," Mr. Khater said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- New-home sales in the U.S. declined in April, posting the largest monthly drop since the end of last year, but there are signs the market for new homes is brightening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes -- a relatively narrow slice of all U.S. home sales -- declined 6.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 673,000 in April, the Commerce Department said Thursday. This was the largest month-on-month drop since December. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had expected a smaller 2.7% drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales declined in all regions but the Northeast, with purchases in the Midwest and West notching the biggest monthly drops since December 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the report offered positive signs. The department raised its estimate of overall new-home sales in March, and sales grew robustly in February and January. Meanwhile, sales were up 7% in April from the prior year. Still, the rate of new-home sales is well below levels before the last recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The new data don't change the big picture, which is that new-home sales have rebounded strongly since the disaster of" the fourth quarter, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broader housing market has faltered for more than a year because rapidly increasing prices, higher mortgage rates and a shortage of inventory have kept many potential buyers out of the market. Sales of previously owned homes, which make up the bulk of housing-market activity, continued to fall in April, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Forman </div><div>439 words</div><div>23 May 2019</div><div>16:30</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Zillow Group</span> says it can profit from a cooling housing market, while skeptics fear a downturn could dent the company's new business. Which side is right? The answer could be coming soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Zillow reported U.S. home values fell from March to April—the first month-over-month decline in housing prices in more than seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while the company cautions against making too much of a single month's change, annual data suggests the housing market has been cooling for months. Year-over-year gains in home prices slowed to 6.1% in April, down from 7.5% in April of last year, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, the property-listings company announced a major business shift[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/zillow-intends-to-buy-and-flip-homes-1523581268]into home flipping, which involves holding costly inventory. Zillow says it expects to be buying roughly 60,000 homes annually within three to five years. Analysts are now expecting the "Homes" business to make up 58% of Zillow's overall revenue in 2020 compared with just 4% in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that could leave the company vulnerable[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/will-zillows-flip-flop-11555844401]. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said he worries a macro downturn could leave Zillow caught holding excess inventory—"a risky situation that is difficult to protect against."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economics of the business are still unproven. Zillow says it plans to make money not off a change in home values, but on its service fee, which averaged 7% in the first quarter. But in a downturn, price declines could overwhelm that service fee. The company is currently registering anywhere from a loss of 2% to a gain of 2% before interest expense on each home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow Chief Executive Rich Barton says he is building a business that works in hot and cold markets, and that Zillow could charge a higher service fee when home prices are falling. Furthermore, he said the certainty Zillow's service provides to sellers in knowing when they will sell and for how much could make the business even more attractive in a down market. Indeed, Mr. Barton says he doesn't view his business as "home flipping" but rather a market-making service, connecting sellers and buyers and adding liquidity to the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow could still get stuck with the inventory but claims it can just sell at lower prices and raise service fees to compensate. The question, then, is how good is its data-based crystal ball?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. dollar fell as fresh data stoked worries about economic growth in the U.S. and abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, fell 0.2% to 91.09 on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales in the U.S. declined in April[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-fell-in-april-11558620316?mod=article_inline], recording the largest month-on-month drop since December of last year and signaling that the housing market is on weaker footing during the critical spring selling season. Purchases of newly built single-family homes fell 6.9% in April. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected a 2.7% drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a measure of activity in the eurozone's manufacturing and services sectors stagnated[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/eurozone-economy-slosws-as-demand-for-exports-stalls-11558619752?mod=article_inline]in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors also bought Treasurys and sold U.S. stocks as anxiety about growth and trade tensions sent investors seeking the relative safety of government bonds. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to at 2.296%, the lowest level since February 2018. Yields fall as bond prices rise, and lower Treasury yields can make the U.S. dollar less attractive to income-seeking investors around the world.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Cezary Podkul </div><div>982 words</div><div>22 May 2019</div><div>19:13</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government accused one of the nation's largest landlords of running a "Ponzi scheme-like" effort using cash from small investors and of misleading banks to obtain bigger loans by using fake loan documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> filed civil charges against Robert C. Morgan, who amassed an empire of more than 140 properties and 34,000 units across 14 states, according to the website of his firm, Morgan Management. On Wednesday, the Justice Department also unveiled criminal charges accusing Mr. Morgan of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, wire fraud and money laundering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SEC said Mr. Morgan raised $110 million from more than 200 mostly small investors beginning in 2013, promising them a target return of 11%. Morgan used most of the cash as a "fraudulent slush fund" to pay previous investors, the SEC said. In one instance, the SEC said cash was used to pay off an $11 million loan that Morgan allegedly obtained by falsifying financial information on a property in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Morgan couldn't be reached for comment. He has previously denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Morgan case is being followed closely by the real-estate industry because many of Mr. Morgan's apartment loans flowed through government mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which bought and repackaged them into securities purchased by investors. That has raised questions whether <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> sufficiently ensure buyers of multifamily apartment buildings aren't misstating incomes—a common problem that plagued single-family housing before the 2008 crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The excesses that happened in single-family are now being transferred to multifamily," said Greg Michaud, director of real estate at Voya Investment Management in Atlanta, which lends to multifamily and other commercial properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SEC said investors are still owed $63 million, but funds through which Mr. Morgan raised money from investors have "few if any assets" available to repay them. Mr. Morgan used the funds to make "Ponzi scheme-like redemptions of earlier investors and to repay nonperforming, maturing loans made by earlier-formed Notes Funds," the SEC said. About three dozen people used retirement accounts to make investments, and one local union pension fund also invested, the SEC said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Morgan was personally involved in the fundraising, the SEC said. In one 2015 email exchange detailed by the SEC, Mr. Morgan told a colleague to "push as hard as you can" and "put the hammer down and raise more funds" from investors. In an effort to help repay investors, the agency also is seeking to freeze Mr. Morgan's assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the separate criminal indictment, U.S. Attorney James P. Kennedy Jr. accused Mr. Morgan, his son, a mortgage broker and a former Morgan Management executive of conspiring to defraud banks and <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> by using falsified financial records to obtain bigger loans than lenders otherwise would have made. Mr. Kennedy said at news conference on Wednesday that the size of the alleged fraud now exceeds $500 million. Mr. Kennedy's office is seeking forfeiture of $267.3 million from the defendants. All four of the defendants, including Mr. Morgan, pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Losses suffered by lenders are currently estimated to exceed $25 million, according to Mr. Kennedy's office. A related insurance fraud scheme—in which Mr. Morgan allegedly conspired to present false invoices to insurance firms to secure bigger payouts on his properties—is estimated to have cost insurers about $3 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the SEC, Mr. Kennedy's office also provided evidence of Mr. Morgan's personal involvement in the alleged schemes. According to the indictment, after Mr. Morgan became aware of an investigation into his properties in the spring of 2017, he planned to create fictitious corporate leases for blocks of apartments to mask lower actual occupancy rates at his properties. Mr. Morgan then arranged for deposits of money into the apartments' accounts and instructed a senior executive to ask two contractors to sign fictitious leases for several apartments and make rent payments. Afterward, he arranged to reimburse them for the rent payments, the Justice Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most recent charges stemmed from a sprawling mortgage-fraud probe[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-pursues-one-of-the-biggest-mortgage-fraud-probes-since-the-financial-crisis-1534357872]by Mr. Kennedy's office that has now resulted in charges against seven men. Three of the seven previously pleaded guilty and have agreed to cooperate with investigators, according to their plea agreements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The charges and guilty pleas could push lenders to chip away at the Morgan empire of apartment buildings, which was ranked as the 15th largest in the U.S. as of earlier this year, according to a ranking by Yardi Matrix, a commercial real estate tracker. They could foreclose on properties involved in the alleged fraud. Most mortgages have a provision allowing lenders to seek foreclosure in case of fraud, although doing so can be time-consuming and leave them owning properties they might not want to hold on their books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some lenders have already sought to foreclose on Morgan-owned properties. Morgan recently lost a 208-unit apartment complex near Syracuse, N.Y., to a mezzanine lender, SteepRock Capital LLC. Creditors holding about $3 billion in Morgan debt have also pressured the family to transfer management of the remaining properties they control, The Wall Street Journal reported in April.[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/apartment-empire-shrinking-in-wake-of-guilty-pleas-11556665804]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harbor Group International, a Norfolk, Va., real-estate firm, has been in negotiations to take over management of most of the Morgan apartment portfolio, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Scott Calvert and Jon Kamp </div><div>814 words</div><div>21 May 2019</div><div>16:48</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BALTIMORE—About 10,000 city government computers here remain frozen two weeks after a disruptive cyberattack that has delayed home sales and halted water bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baltimore was hit May 7 by hackers demanding an undisclosed sum to unlock computers. The city hasn't paid, and the <span class="companylink">Federal Bureau of Investigation</span> is probing the incident. Mayor Bernard C. "Jack" Young has warned it could take months to recover some systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's extremely alarming," said City Council President Brandon Scott.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is Baltimore's second cyberattack in 15 months. In March 2018, a short-lived ransomware attack on the city's 911 system forced dispatchers to temporarily relay addresses and other information to first-responders by phone rather than electronically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City officials emphasized that key services such as 911 emergency dispatch haven't been affected by the current cyberattack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ransomware attacks are common in both the public and private sectors, and attackers are generally looking to exploit any vulnerability[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/ransom-demands-and-frozen-computers-hackers-hit-towns-across-the-u-s-1529838001] they can turn into extortion for money. After accessing systems through methods like malicious emails, hackers can encrypt files and then demand payment in bitcoin to unlock them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local governments are often more vulnerable than private companies, said Bill Siegel, chief executive at Coveware, a Connecticut-based firm that helps entities victimized by cyberattacks. "I think broadly they are not prepared for these sorts of things, they do not have the budget," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Baltimore, "I think it's pretty obvious that they have not been able to stay ahead of it," said Mr. Siegel, who hasn't worked with the city on this problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Johnson, Baltimore's chief information officer, didn't respond to a request to comment Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scott said he will form a special committee to investigate the episode and city officials' handling of it, "but most importantly, how they're going to work to have this not happen in the future."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the city and outside contractors continued working Monday to restore the municipal computer system, officials began implementing a workaround to allow home sales to proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 200 and 300 closings have been hung up because the city couldn't tell title insurers whether the seller had any unpaid liens, said Alan Ingraham, chief executive of the Greater Baltimore Board of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting Monday, sellers were able to sign an affidavit promising to pay any liens, such as unpaid water bills, that are discovered once the computers come back online. Mr. Young's office said the city processed 42 applications for property deeds on the first day of the workaround.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Glazer, executive director of the <span class="companylink">Maryland Land Title Association</span>, a trade group for title insurers and agents, said this helps but he hopes the city resumes full operations quickly. May and June are busy months for deal closings, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the problems continue for some city agencies. Epidemiologists in Baltimore's health department can't access the state network that helps them warn the public when bad batches of street drugs trigger overdoses. And the city's public-works department can't generate new water bills for customers, which could mean residents will get unusually high bills once the problem is fixed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can't see the consumption data that our meters are collecting and sending to us," said Jeff Raymond, a spokesman for the public-works department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenville, N.C., was attacked last month by the same type of ransomware afflicting Baltimore, dubbed Robbinhood. The attackers demanded 13 bitcoins—worth roughly $69,000 at that point—to unlock the city's files. The city didn't pay, spokesman Brock Letchworth said in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While not 100% restored, all of our major technology needs are now being met," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta last year endured one of the highest-profile ransomware attacks on a major city. The city also refused to pay the ransom demand[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/probes-cyberattack-distract-atlanta-as-it-tries-to-woo-amazon-1527418800]—$51,000 in that case—and has faced millions of dollars in costs to rebuild and bolster defenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Baltimore, Mr. Scott said he pushed city officials to strengthen cyber defenses after last year's 911 hack but that they "decided not to invest in this area."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for Mr. Young, who became mayor May 2 upon the resignation[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/baltimore-mayor-catherine-pugh-resigns-11556825577] of Catherine Pugh, said Mr. Young has directed officials to obtain cybersecurity insurance[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/more-cities-brace-for-inevitable-cyberattack-1536053401], which would help offset the cost of any future hacks.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday: The eurozone economy regained some of its lost momentum in the first quarter, but economists view the outlook as highly uncertain. Surveys of purchasing managers painted a more downbeat picture of activity in the first three months of the year than appears to have been warranted. Economists expect the composite PMI to rise slightly to 51.7 from 51.5 in April, pointing to a modest expansion in the services and manufacturing sectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S.-based <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> releases its latest gauge of sales of existing homes in the U.S. Sales of previously owned homes sputtered in March, failing to build off strong gains in February. Still, economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect the trend changed in April with a solid 3.1% increase on the month. Also, the <span class="companylink">U.S. Commerce Department</span> publishes data on new-home sales, a smaller piece of the housing market. Purchases of new homes in the U.S. increased in March, driven by sales gains in most parts of the nation. But economists predict sales dropped in April despite a deceleration in new-home price growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday: The department releases durable goods orders figures. Orders for long-lasting factory goods rose in March at the fastest clip in seven months, surpassing expectations and suggesting demand picked up after a slow start to the year. Economists think this trend reversed in April, too, with orders declining 2%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Justin Lahart </div><div>819 words</div><div>18 May 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B16</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than a decade has passed since the financial crisis hit, yet the housing market remains in a deep funk. Fear not: A wave of millennial buyers is about to hit the scene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the weirder things about the current economic recovery is how little housing has contributed to it. Unlike past expansions, which have tended to start with a flurry of home buying, the housing market remains deeply depressed. Last year, there were a combined 5.4 million new and existing homes sold. That was about even with 1998's tally, when there were 50 million fewer people living in the U.S. The lasting slump is a reminder of just how severe the financial crisis was and how housing itself was at its epicenter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the millennial generation of Americans born from 1981 to 1995 have reached the age when people tend to buy homes. They could buy a lot of them. As of last year, there were 67.7 million millennials, according to the Census Bureau. At the same age, the membership of Generation X -- the prior demographic cohort -- was about 3.7 million people shy of that total.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But people have been talking for a while now about how millennials are going to reinvigorate the housing market, and so far they haven't. The homeownership rate among households headed by someone under 35 was 35.4% as of the first quarter, according to the Census Bureau. In 1999 that level was about 40%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A case can be made that the millennial wave has merely been delayed. The recession that ended in 2009 was unusually severe, and it hit millennials particularly hard, just as many of them were entering the workforce. The unemployment rate among workers age 20 to 24 shot as high as 17% in 2010. It would have been even higher if more young people hadn't opted to continue schooling instead of joining the labor force or simply stopped looking for work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of millennials' delayed entry into the workforce, it is probably taking them longer to develop the financial wherewithal to buy a home. Many also are saddled with higher levels of student debt than previous generations, making mortgage approvals more daunting. Moreover, the tough labor market they faced early in their careers may have delayed other life events that often coincide with the decision to own a home. Compared with previous generations, for example, millennials have been getting married and having children later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the scars left by the financial crisis may never fully fade, though, limiting the number of millennials who achieve homeownership at any point in their lives. Take, for instance, the belief widely held until the bust that houses were a great investment because home prices never fall. Millennials learned during the crisis that this simply isn't true. Like members of previous generations that came of age during hard economic times, millennials may be less willing to take on financial risks than people born in more prosperous periods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changes in the regulatory and financial environment have also made homeownership less enticing, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Michelle Meyer. Up until the crisis, government officials considered increased homeownership desirable, claiming it helped Americans accumulate wealth and build healthy communities. That notion has lost some currency, and the 2017 tax cuts actually reduced the financial incentives for homeownership. Furthermore, banks have become more risk-averse since the crisis. Many have become more eager to extend pricey mortgages to wealthier clients than to lend to those seeking smaller home loans, as do many first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A greater preference for urban living also could make millennials less likely to become homeowners than previous generations. Economists at <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> point out that a greater share of millennials live in the central city of a metropolitan area with a population of at least 500,000 than did Generation X at the same age. Moreover, fewer urban millennials have decamped to the suburbs in their 30s than previous generations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are, of course, substantially higher in many cities than in outlying areas, and while the higher incomes offered by urban jobs help mitigate that, for many people they remain out of reach. Only 33% of New York City homes are owner-occupied, for example, compared with 64% nationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It still seems likely that, as they age, many millennials will catch up with their predecessors and finally buy a place of their own. But when it comes to the housing market, the millennial buying wave may end up being little more than a ripple.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAUSALITO, Calif. -- Homelessness has become such a big problem in the San Francisco area that waters outside the city are increasingly crowded with people living on makeshift boats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homeless population floating off the coast of wealthy Marin County, just north of San Francisco, has doubled in recent years to about 100, according to authorities. The ragtag collection of some 200 barges, sailboats, and other mostly decrepit boats in which they live and store their belongings is a sign of an affordable-housing crisis in California that is being felt particularly acutely in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boating homeless include some who are employed but say they can't afford to live on land, some who prefer the independence and others who are jobless or mentally ill. The seafaring life isn't easy for any of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not a free ride. It's a lot of effort to be out here," said Kristina Weber, who moved onto a 54-foot boat she purchased for $15,000 because she couldn't afford rent for a studio apartment in Sausalito, a town 10 miles north of San Francisco, that had grown to $3,000 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who live on the land nearby complain Ms. Weber and her neighbors have brought crime and poor sanitation, the same problems that accompany homeless encampments in nearby cities that have sprung up amid soaring housing prices driven in part by the region's tech boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for an existing single-family home in the Bay Area has nearly tripled to $940,000 from $327,000 since 2009, according to March data from the <span class="companylink">California Association of Realtors</span>, amid a surge in tech jobs over the same time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local residents complain that boats sometimes break away from anchor lines in storms, endangering the occupants as well as the waterfront homes into which they can crash. Many aren't securely anchored and are attached to smaller boats in which residents store gear and other belongings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Authorities call these water-dwelling homeless "anchor-outs," because they permanently anchor crafts outside marinas in violation of local laws that typically set mooring limits of about three days. They have become a growing problem in pricey coastal locales from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to Honolulu, Hawaii.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Francisco Bay, anchor-outs have been a tradition since the California Gold Rush. But local authorities have been moved into action as the numbers have grown over the past decade. More than 40 boats were removed after a multiagency crackdown along the Oakland waterfront in 2013 and another nine were sent away in April of this year, said Brock de Lappe, harbor master for five Oakland marinas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They are taking over a public resource," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With crackdowns elsewhere in the area, many anchor-outs started showing up in the waters between the Marin County cities of Sausalito and Belvedere over the past few years, said Beth Pollard, executive director of the Richardson's Bay Regional Agency, which has jurisdiction over the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than push the homeless out, her agency is trying to make sure the boats stay secured to authorized moorings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That approach has infuriated people like Jim Robertson, who said runaway boats have collided with his home 16 times over the two decades he has lived there -- including one collision with his dock that cost $20,000 to repair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nobody is looking for special treatment, just the enforcement of laws on the books," Mr. Robertson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His neighbor, Connie Strycker, said anchor-out residents come up on her deck asking for food and water. "They're all filthy, because they have no place to bathe," said the 86-year-old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city of Sausalito in 2017 withdrew from the Richardson's agency in protest of its hands-off policy. Since then, it has reduced the number of anchor-out boats in its waters to 20 from 77. This summer, Sausalito plans to start a pilot program of subsidizing marina space to eight of the boats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sausalito Police Chief John Rohrbacher said many in the latest influx of anchor-outs are dangerously inexperienced on the water. "There are some really good people out here, but they're just living a hard life," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few anchor-outs have been on the water as long as Greg Baker, who lives alone in a 41-foot sailboat called the C.A. Marcy that is anchored in several feet of mud. The former tugboat captain agrees too many people are on the bay who don't know what they're doing. He hopes to change that through a community association of anchor-outs he helped form recently to push for safer practices. Moving, he said, isn't an option for him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are two ways I'm leaving: in a black body bag or handcuffs," said the 80-year-old, rubbing his whiskers as a stiff breeze tossed the surrounding waters.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—A gauge of home building across the U.S. increased in April, driven by an uptick in single-family construction across much of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So-called housing starts rose 5.7% in April from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.235 million, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Residential building permits, which can signal how much construction is in the pipeline, climbed 0.6% from March to an annual pace of 1.296 million in April, the first monthly increase since December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building projects for single-family homes rose in every region of the U.S. but the South. Meanwhile, construction in the Northeast increased at the fastest pace in nearly two years. This building uptick suggests residential construction could boost economic growth in the second quarter more than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall building rose for both single-family homes and apartment properties. Permits for single-family homes, however, declined, suggesting the starts gain "might represent a temporary burst rather than a fundamental turn," according to Daiwa Capital Markets' Michael Moran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building projects for single families have held near the highest levels since before the most recent recession, while multifamily construction eased because of a glut of apartment properties in some parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-starts data are volatile from month to month and can be subject to large revisions. April's 5.7% rise for starts came with a margin of error of 13 percentage points. Still, home construction has been cooling more broadly. Starts were down 7.2% in the first four months of 2019 compared with the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy should be poised to spur strong consumer demand for housing. Employers continue to churn out jobs at a time when the unemployment rate is hovering near historic lows [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-jobless-claims-fell-last-week-11558009981]. This has spurred some of the fastest wage growth in recent years and is buoying solid consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a host of factors, including a lack of available land and rising input costs have driven up prices, causing a slowdown in the broader housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, interest rates have pulled back recently. New-home price growth has decelerated and home sales in this category have picked up, a potential bright spot for the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This implies builders will build more if new home sales continue at their current pace," according to Ian Shepherdson , chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. "Homebuilders eventually will act; no one wants to lose share in a rising market."</p>

</div><div class="author">By James Bacchus </div><div>913 words</div><div>13 May 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A19</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Trump and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer are right: A trade deal with China must end the market distortions of Beijing's illegal, often invisible subsidies, which allow state-owned enterprises and other Chinese companies to secure an unfair advantage. But tariffs won't achieve that goal. Instead the administration should offer to end America's own unfair trade practices, which discriminate against an array of imported Chinese products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anti-dumping and other trade remedies that increase tariffs on imports have soared under the Trump administration, and Chinese products have been the target in about 40% of those U.S. investigations. Products affected include everything from aluminum alloy, silk ribbons and rubber bands to, most recently, metal file cabinets and ceramic tile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. imposes higher anti-dumping duties on China than on any other country, and these duties have increased over time, particularly as they have been imposed together with duties countering Chinese subsidies. Relief from the burden of this recent surge of trade remedies is at the top of China's agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of these U.S. trade remedies are legitimate under the rules of the <span class="companylink">World Trade Organization</span>. Others, however, reflect the considerable influence on American administrative outcomes of trade-challenged U.S. industries -- an egregious example of American crony capitalism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the past 40 years, since responsibility was shifted from the Treasury to the Commerce Department and the <span class="companylink">U.S. International Trade Commission</span>, America's application of trade remedies has, as my <span class="companylink">Cato Institute</span> colleague Dan Ikenson has put it, "gradually transformed from one predicated on protecting consumers from collusive or predatory trade practices into a tool to suppress competition in the name of remedying 'injury' experienced by domestic producers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This shift happened over time as a result of persistent pressure by import-competing domestic industries and their well-placed congressional tribunes from politically pivotal states. Commerce and the <span class="companylink">International Trade Commission</span> have been heavily influenced by lawyers and lobbyists for U.S. industries seeking trade protection from foreign competition. (One of them, incidentally, was Mr. Lighthizer, an international-trade lawyer in private practice until 2017.) Through various protectionist sleights-of-hand, these agencies sometimes invent a justification for a trade remedy and impose a harsher penalty than the offense warrants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dumping occurs when a manufacturer charges lower prices for the same product in an export market than in the domestic market. Determining the existence and severity of dumping thus involves a comparison of prices. In deciding which prices are compared, U.S. anti-dumping rules and practices tend to inflate home-market prices and underestimate export prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Below-cost sales in the home market are excluded from any calculation of domestic prices. Discounted domestic sales to the producer's corporate affiliates are excluded. The result, conveniently for protected American interests, is that sales in the U.S. are compared only with the highest-priced sales in the home market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price deductions for indirect selling expenses (such as sales staff salaries and overhead) are capped for the home market but not for the export market, which widens the margin of dumping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instances in which export prices in the U.S. are higher than home-market prices are ignored in some dumping calculations, through the internationally controversial "zeroing" method. In addition, when there is supposedly no home market -- as is often the case with China -- fictional home-market prices are constructed using the proxy of prices from third countries, which may not reflect the reality of domestic Chinese pricing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the delight of all those seeking protection from foreign competition, all these devices and more increase the likelihood that the U.S. will determine that "dumping" has taken place -- and will levy higher dumping duties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of these esoteric procedures are likely to come up in a presidential debate or campaign ad. Yet they have enormous economic consequences. Trade distortions resulting from their use insulate some U.S. industries from perfectly fair foreign competition, increase costs for U.S. industries that use imports in their production, and impose an ever-increasing hidden tax at the cash register for American consumers. This not only harms the Chinese. It also diminishes America's global competitiveness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. has lost a long string of <span class="companylink">WTO</span> cases about its trade remedies -- some based on complaints brought by China. Yet U.S. regulators continue to drag their feet on <span class="companylink">WTO</span> compliance, gravitate toward the outer edges of <span class="companylink">WTO</span> rules, and find new ways to discriminate against Chinese imports. The prospect of ending these practices could be a powerful inducement for China to abandon its own unfair trade practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, offering a carrot instead of a stick seems alien to the blunt bluster of Mr. Trump's approach to deal-making. But both he and Mr. Lighthizer have said they want a deal that addresses the fundamental problem of Chinese industrial subsidies. Both have claimed that their ultimate goal is free trade. They can prove it by offering to end U.S. abuses of trade remedies in exchange for an end to trade-distorting Chinese industrial subsidies -- a deal that would free more trade and create more prosperity for both countries.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications: Tal Alexander shares the listing with colleagues Oren Alexander and Isaac Lustgarten. An earlier version of this article did not include him. (5/8/2019)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jorge Pérez, the billionaire real-estate developer widely referred to as Miami's "condo king," is having a bit of trouble selling his own: He is relisting his Miami condo for $10.95 million, or 45% off what he first sought three years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pérez, CEO of the Related Group, said he first listed the property at One Ocean for $20 million in 2016, when the rise of the Miami market looked unstoppable. He received an offer of $15 million, which he rejected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My expectations were way too high, I admit," he said. "But I was responding to what I saw in that moment in the market, without any immediate need to sell. Now, I'm saying, 'Boy I should have sold.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pérez, 70, said the price drop speaks to the overall downturn in Miami's ultra-luxury market, which has struggled over the past year thanks to an oversupply of product, fears that climate change will result in widespread flooding and cooling demand from South American buyers, whose currencies have lost strength against the dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pérez reserved the penthouse unit for himself atop the roughly 50-unit building when the oceanfront condo was still under construction. Records show he paid $4.2 million for the apartment. The roughly 3,600-square-foot home has four bedrooms, a maid's room, around 4,000 square feet of outdoor space, a Jacuzzi, an outdoor summer kitchen and a wet bar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pérez said he considered making the apartment his family's primary home but, ultimately, it made sense for them to remain in their single-family home in the nearby Coconut Grove area, which is closer to where his 15-year-old son attends school. The family has occasionally spent time at the apartment on weekends, and Mr. Pérez said he enjoys being close to some of his favorite restaurants, like retro hangout Big Pink and Joe's Stone Crab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pérez is not the only big-name owner to get caught by the Miami downturn. Art dealer Larry Gagosian and investor Leon Black, both of whom owned at nearby Faena House, recently suffered losses selling their units, The Wall Street Journal reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Peter Zalewski, a principal with Miami real estate consulting firm Condo Vultures, said that Miami Beach has close to 750 condos on the market asking $1 million or more. Around 250 condos traded above that price point in the area last year, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While he said he is confident the market will improve in a year or two, Mr. Pérez said his company has temporarily hit the brakes on several residential projects it had been planning to develop in Miami, including a project in the Brickell Avenue area and another in the Edgewater area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now is not the time," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ryan Dezember </div><div>668 words</div><div>3 May 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumber prices typically rise in the spring as builders stock up for construction season. But this year, they are being hit hard by bad weather and a decline in home building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slump comes a year after lumber prices reached record levels and were climbing higher amid a resurgent U.S. housing market, a boom in spending on home renovations and difficulties transporting wood from mills to building sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumber futures settled at $343.70 per 1,000 board feet on the <span class="companylink">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</span> on Thursday -- down nearly half from the high of $639 reached on May 17, 2018. Prices collapsed right after they hit that peak, and there has been little reason this spring for them to bounce back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two big Canadian mill owners -- <span class="companylink">Canfor Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Interfor Corp</span>. -- said last week they would curtail output in their British Columbia facilities in response to low prices. The announcements nudged lumber prices higher, but futures have since given up some of the gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bad weather in key markets has hampered building and renovating new homes and limited orders. Nashville, Tenn.'s hot housing market was doused by more than a foot of rainfall in February. Seattle suffered record snowfall, and it has been extremely soggy in two of the country's top markets for fix-and-flip jobs, Birmingham, Ala., and Memphis, Tenn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, housing starts and building permits unexpectedly declined in March. Starts plunged 9.7%, and permits dropped 5.4% during the first three months of 2019 compared with the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes also fell in March, the 13th straight month of year-over-year declines. That is problematic for lumber producers because home sales tend to spark demand from sellers making repairs before listing their properties and from buyers who undertake renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing statistics have been worrisome," said Adam Perpich, a Des Moines, Iowa-based lumber trader with <span class="companylink">Forest City Trading Group</span>. However, he said his trading partners have been bullish on a resumption of housing activity now that weather has moderated in key markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're going to sell a lot more sticks over the next 60 days than they did over the last 60 days," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another positive sign for lumber prices are recent new-home sales. They rose 3% in March over the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives with <span class="companylink">Weyerhaeuser Co</span>., the country's top timberland owner and one of the largest lumber producers, said last week they were optimistic that housing would rebound due to lower mortgage rates, strong job growth and better weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief Executive Devin Stockfish said he also expects continued strength in remodeling, which accounts for about 40% of lumber consumption, to buoy prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-improvement spending has risen more than 50% since the depths of last decade's housing crisis. A dearth of new homes spurred investors to rehab and flip older homes to meet demand while rising property values emboldened homeowners to spend on home-improvement projects and provided many of them with equity to tap to pay for the work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That growth, which has been climbing at an annual rate of about 7% lately, could be slowing, according to data from Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies. Abbe Will, associate project director for the center's Remodeling Futures Program, said the model it has developed to predict future home-improvement spending has forecast the growth rate to fall to 2.6% a year from now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A growth rate below 5%, the historical average, signifies a pullback in discretionary spending by homeowners, Ms. Will said. The last time there was such a drop in renovation spending was the summer of 2007. Home prices across the country crashed then, and so did lumber prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're starting to feel a little nervous about the market in the next year," she said. "This certainly does look like a turning point in the cycle."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Adam Bonislawski </div><div>473 words</div><div>3 May 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congestion pricing won't make only driving in New York City more expensive. Research suggests it also could boost residential real-estate prices inside the pricing zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a move intended to lighten traffic and raise revenue for the city's subways, the New York State government agreed in March to levy congestion fees on cars navigating Manhattan south of 60th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's unwelcome news for commuters accustomed to driving into the city for work, but it is potentially a boon to homeowners within the congestion zone, said Cheng Keat Tang, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Southern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a working paper published last year, Dr. Tang looked at the impact of London's congestion pricing plan (which went into effect in 2003) on traffic and residential real-estate prices. He analyzed 79,322 home sales in the pricing zone and 74,835 sales outside it that occurred between the first quarter of 2000 and the fourth quarter of 2015. He found that implementation of congestion pricing raised home values within the zone by 3%, which he said translates to "a windfall of more than GBP 10 billion [$13 billion] for homeowners."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you think about the rationale of the policy and the benefits it generates inside the zone, you would expect house prices to increase because you have much less traffic around your house after the congestion charge," Dr. Tang said. "And that is what we found in London."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial real-estate owners might not fare as well. A 2015 study published in the Journal of Urban Economics found that Singapore's congestion fees led to a 19% drop in retail real-estate prices within the pricing zone. The study, by researchers at the <span class="companylink">National University of Singapore</span>, found the fees had "no significant impact" on residential real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Chin, managing director of New York City real-estate firm Keller Williams Tribeca, said he expected housing prices in outer-borough neighborhoods with poor public-transit access to take a hit as residents are forced to contend with additional commuting costs. He also suggested that the expected increased traffic could depress prices in areas just outside the zone's borders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If I were looking at real estate in the 60s, I would be thinking [the pricing plan] could have a slightly negative impact," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, Mr. Chin added, the ultimate tally of winners and losers will depend on the exact structure of the plan, which could include various exemptions and discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I can smell the lobbyists from here," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth slowed to its lowest level in nearly seven years in February, a clear sign that the housing market is moderating heading into the important spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 4% in the 12 months to February, down from a 4.2% annual pace the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth has been slowing for nearly a year, welcome news for first-time buyers who have been struggling to get into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The slowdown reflects the wider range of inventory that buyers had available this winter, which gave them more breathing room around prices than they have had in a while," said Zillow Economic Analyst Matthew Speakman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus far more modest home price growth has yet to translate into the stronger sales that real-estate agents and economists had hoped for. Existing home sales fell nearly 5% in March[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-declined-in-march-11555941842].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless real-estate agents say demand for buyers this spring has been strong thanks to more moderate prices and lower mortgage rates. Data released on Tuesday by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> showed that pending sales—a forward-looking index based on signed contracts for sale—climbed 3.8% in March from February, indicating sales could strengthen in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are still growing faster than wages for private-sector workers, which climbed 3.2% in March from a year earlier, according to the Labor Department. Economists also say that much of the moderation in price growth is happening at the high end, while there is still more demand than supply in the starter-home market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller 10-city index gained 2.6% over the 12 months to February, slowing sharply from a 3.1% annual change in January. The 20-city index gained 3%, also a significant slowdown from an annual gain of 3.5% to January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price growth is now being driven by markets that saw the biggest boom and bust during the last bubble. One reason not to be overly concerned that these markets are once again overheating is that price growth is slowing in these places as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas had the fastest home-price growth in the country for the ninth straight month, at 9.7%. That was down from 10.5% in the 12-month period ended in January. Prices also remain nearly 20% below their prior 2006 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix had the second-fastest price growth at 6.7%, followed by Tampa at 5.4%. Only one of the 20 cities in the Case Shiller index reported a greater increase in the 12 months ended in February compared with the 12 months ended in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, more expensive markets on the West Coast have seen a significant slowdown in price growth. Prices in San Francisco grew just 1.4% in the year to February. Just a year ago prices were growing at an annual pace of 10%. Prices in Seattle, which for much of 2017 and 2018 had the fastest home-price growth in the country, are now growing just 2.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While we're not in a buyer's market yet, several Pacific Coast markets are on the cusp of seeing the first annual declines in home prices since 2012," said Ralph McLaughlin, deputy chief economist at <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, said he expects home-price growth to continue easing in the coming months. "There are several comments saying housing is about to have a rebound but I don't really see that," he said. "Most of the broad indicators about the economy look nice but housing is slowly easing back."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>551 words</div><div>26 April 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. homeownership rate fell for the first time in more than two years during the first quarter, putting the brakes on the recovery of an important piece of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homeownership rate fell to 64.2% in the first quarter from 64.8% in the fourth quarter, according to <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span> figures released Thursday -- a notable drop for a number that barely moves from one quarter to the next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After more than a decade of declines, the homeownership rate had been reliably on the upswing since the beginning of 2017, and it had been nearing its historic average of around 65%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers "are hitting a bit of an affordability ceiling here," said Zillow Director of Economic Research Skylar Olsen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rising homeownership rate primarily reflects younger households successfully making the transition from renting to owning, which for many families is critical to saving for retirement and for other big expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those households have struggled in recent months as mortgage rates have risen and there has been a shortage of lower-priced inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Younger buyers, who had been driving the rise in homeownership for the last couple of years, had some of the steepest falls in the first quarter. The homeownership rate of households headed by someone under 35 years old dropped to 35.4% from 36.5% in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homeownership rate among households headed by someone 35 to 44 dropped to 60.3% from 61.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homeownership rate is volatile, and it would take several straight quarters of decline to indicate owning a home is once again in decline in the U.S. While the homeownership rate fell over the quarter, it was virtually unchanged from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was good news for rental landlords in Thursday's Census report. The number of renter households increased by 458,000 in the first quarter, compared with a year earlier, reversing a trend of declines in the number of Americans who rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of owner households also increased by about 1 million during the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market slowed in the second half of 2018, due to rising mortgage rates, high home prices and a shortage of starter-home inventory. Average mortgage rates for a 30-year loan have since fallen from nearly 5% in the fall to just over 4% today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, cheaper interest rates and slowing home-price growth have yet to translate into stronger housing-market data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joel Kan, associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting at the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>, said he expected the first-quarter drop in the homeownership rate to be a blip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millennials are entering their early to mid-30s and eager to buy homes, which should translate to a higher homeownership rate in the coming quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had a really, really volatile end of 2018," Mr. Kan said, pointing to swings in the stock market, fears about slowing economic growth and declines in home sales. "Most of these [younger] borrowers are going to be in tighter financial circumstances. They are going to be more vulnerable to big swings."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Purchases of new homes in the U.S. increased in March, driven by sales gains in most parts of the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes -- a relatively narrow slice of all U.S. home sales -- rose 4.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 692,000 in March, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 2.5% decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were up 3.0% in March from the prior year. The pace of new-home sales remains well below the elevated levels seen before the 2007-09 financial crisis and recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All U.S. regions but the Northeast saw new-home sales gains last month, with purchases in the South reaching the highest level in more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the broader housing market, inventory has been tight, driving a run-up in home prices and keeping some potential buyers out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, construction-labor shortages and rising input costs are pushing up the overall cost of buying new homes, though prices fell last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The months' supply of new homes for sale on the market was 6.0 in March, up from 5.3 a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With more homes on the market, the median sales price of a new home declined to $302,700, the lowest level in more than two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report that tracks U.S. home building and approvals for new projects showed both dropped in March, continuing a recent weak stretch for new housing construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, a gauge of U.S. home-builder confidence rose in April, the third increase in four months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of previously owned homes, which make up the bulk of U.S. homebuying, faltered in March despite lower mortgage rates and a strong job market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A gauge of U.S. home building and approvals for new projects declined in March, continuing a recent weak stretch for new housing construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So-called housing starts fell 0.3% in March from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.139 million, the Commerce Department said Friday. Residential building permits, which can signal how much construction is in the pipeline, dropped 1.7% from February to an annual pace of 1.269 million in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These declines were unexpected; economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had predicted a 4.1% increase for starts and a 0.3% gain for permits in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-starts data are volatile from month to month and can be subject to large revisions. March's 0.3% drop for starts came with a margin of error of 14.6 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, home construction has been weak, more broadly. Starts were down 9.7% in the first three months of 2019 compared with the year-earlier period. Permits were down 5.4% year to date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This lackluster March report is a surprise, with housing starts still not regaining the momentum expected from lower interest rates, a strong labor market and other bullish economic signals," said Zillow economic analyst Matthew Speakman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home construction and permits for this property type fell in March. Apartment building and approvals for multifamily projects declined from February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family building has held near the highest levels since before the most recent recession, while multifamily construction eased because of a glut of apartment properties in certain metro areas.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of New York City rental apartment buildings plummeted in the first quarter, signaling the uncertainty around rent regulation after the current law expires in a few weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of deals for residential rental buildings dropped by nearly half in the first three months of the year to 127, compared with 243 in the first quarter last year. The value of sales tumbled 43% from $2.3 billion to $1.3 billion, according to a report from real-estate services firm B6 Real Estate Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uncertainty surrounding the rent stabilization law, which expires after June 15, is partly to blame, the report said. Some proposed measures would further restrict landlords' ability to raise rents on regulated apartments. That could put a big dent in building income and property values, real-estate executives and analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changes to rent regulation laws could decrease the net operating income of rent-stabilized housing across New York City by 20% to 30%, according to an analysis from the <span class="companylink">Real Estate Board of New York</span>, the real-estate industry's lobbying organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospect has some investors waiting on the sidelines until there is a resolution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right now, whatever projections you have prior to June is scrap paper," said Adelaide Polsinelli, a vice chair at real-estate services firm Compass. "Put it in the shredder."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The push for rent regulation is one of the recent efforts by Democratic lawmakers[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/progressive-lawmakers-take-aim-at-landlords-with-rent-control-tax-proposals-11549980000?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=4], in control of the assembly and senate for the first time in years, to raise new funds by targeting the real-estate industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state legislature chose to increase the tax[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/new-more-broad-based-real-estate-tax-hits-developers-11554303511?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=1] on real-estate transfers and expand the so-called mansion tax on high-priced homes in New York City in the recent budget agreement, hitting a wider range of properties than those targeted in an earlier plan for a pied-à-terre tax[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/new-york-leaders-retreat-from-annual-tax-on-high-priced-second-homes-11553643824?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=5] aimed at the wealthiest second homeowners in Manhattan. A transfer tax is a one-time tax usually set as a percentage of a property's sale price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first quarter, the share of rental residential sales with at least 50% free market units was 45%, much larger than the typical upper-20% to the lower-30% range, said Adrian Mercado, chief information officer at B6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to rent regulation concerns, the large number of apartments and buildings that have been renovated and deregulated over the past three to four years and are now on the market could have been a factor, Mr. Mercado said.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uncertainty about where interest rates were headed also was a factor, said Paul Massey, chief executive officer of B6. But with <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> officials last month signaling interest rates would remain steady, Mr. Massey is predicting a spike in buying and said buyers are aggressively bidding on properties on the market now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The smart money buyers are betting the city and state will act rationally, that they will want private capital to improve housing stock," Mr. Massey said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trump administration has finally turned its attention to housing policy. Unfortunately, the president's Memorandum on Housing Finance Reform, issued last week, is a major disappointment. It will keep taxpayers on the hook for more than $7 trillion in mortgage debt. And it is likely to induce another housing-market bust, for which President Trump will take the blame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The memo directs the Treasury to produce a government housing-finance system that roughly replicates what existed before 2008: government backing for the obligations of the government-sponsored enterprises <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, and affordable-housing mandates requiring the GSEs to encourage and engage in risky mortgage lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These elements will be retained, but the problems they caused in 2008 are supposed to be mitigated by better regulation, more capital for the GSEs, and compensation to taxpayers for the risks they'll assume when the government guarantees the GSEs' obligations. The housing lobby misled the public before on the efficacy of these protections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An administration that believes in deregulation should do better. The Trump administration could have used its control over the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> -- the regulator and conservator of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> -- to shrink their footprint dramatically over five to 10 years. This would be done through administrative action, reducing the size and types of the mortgages that GSEs could buy and opening larger portions of the housing-finance market to the private sector, which offers 30-year fixed-rate loans at rates competitive with the GSEs'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the U.S. economy is open to the innovation and competition of the private sector. Yet for no discernible reason, the housing market -- one-sixth of the U.S. economy -- is and has been controlled by the government to a far greater extent than in any other developed country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 1992, this government intervention has been guided by the misconception that low down payments and high debt-to-income ratios will help low- and middle-income families buy homes. The resulting policies produced a highly volatile U.S. housing market, subject to enormous booms and busts. Its culmination was the 2008 financial crisis, in which a massive housing-price boom -- driven by the credit leverage associated with low down payments -- led to millions of mortgage defaults when housing prices regressed to the long-term mean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These policies continue and haven't helped low- and middle-income home buyers; indeed, since 2012, they have driven up housing prices for these buyers at roughly the rate that prevailed before 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of Mr. Trump's first term, his administration will have squandered the opportunity to substantially privatize one-sixth of the U.S. economy. Instead, the policies that contributed to the last housing bust will remain in place, enabling Democrats to blame Mr. Trump for the next one. Even though Democrats originated these policies, they'll have a point.</p>

The Trump administration could have used its control over the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>—the regulator and conservator of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>—to shrink their footprint dramatically over five to 10 years. This would be done through administrative action, reducing the size and types of the mortgages that GSEs could buy and opening larger portions of the housing-finance market to the private sector, which offers 30-year fixed-rate loans at rates competitive with the GSEs'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the U.S. economy is open to the innovation and competition of the private sector. Yet for no discernible reason, the housing market—one-sixth of the U.S. economy—is and has been controlled by the government to a far greater extent than in any other developed country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 1992, this government intervention has been guided by the misconception that low down payments and high debt-to-income ratios will help low- and middle-income families buy homes. The resulting policies produced a highly volatile U.S. housing market, subject to enormous booms and busts. Its culmination was the 2008 financial crisis, in which a massive housing-price boom—driven by the credit leverage associated with low down payments—led to millions of mortgage defaults when housing prices regressed to the long-term mean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These policies continue and haven't helped low- and middle-income home buyers; indeed, since 2012, they have driven up housing prices for these buyers at roughly the rate that prevailed before 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of Mr. Trump's first term, his administration will have squandered the opportunity to substantially privatize one-sixth of the U.S. economy. Instead, the policies that contributed to the last housing bust will remain in place, enabling Democrats to blame Mr. Trump for the next one. Even though Democrats originated these policies, they'll have a point.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past two decades, home prices in some leading North American and European cities have skyrocketed. In Tokyo, however, they've flatlined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why no affordable-housing crisis in Japan? A big factor, experts say, is the country's relatively deregulated housing policies, which have allowed housing supply to keep up with demand in the 21st century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With no rent controls and fewer restrictions on height and density, Tokyo appears to be a city where the market is under control—where supply is keeping home prices from rising as drastically as they have in many other major world cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A reason why housing prices in Japan are not rising as fast as in New York, for example, is the large number of housing starts," says Masahiro Kobayashi, a director general at the Japan Housing Finance Agency, a state-run entity which supports the housing market by purchasing home loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past decade, Japan has consistently built almost 1 million new homes and apartments each year, according to official statistics. In the U.S., where the population is more than double Japan's, 1.25 million new homes were built in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan's home prices finished last year around the same level as they were nearly a decade ago, according to data from <span class="companylink">Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism</span>. In Tokyo, home prices finished 2018 around the same level as they were near the turn of the century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices have been constrained in some parts of Japan due to anemic economic growth and population decline, said Mr. Kobayashi. But the price trend is the same in Tokyo, where the population is rising, he said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Masahiro Kobayashi, a director general at the Japan Housing Finance Agency, in Tokyo last month. PHOTO: Ko Sasaki for The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Tokyo last year, housing starts came in around 145,000, according to <span class="companylink">Japan's land ministry</span>. This figure is on par with the total number of new housing units authorized last year in New York, Los Angeles, Boston and Houston combined, based on the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span> data. The same feat was achieved in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents also have barely moved. Last year the average rent for a two-bedroom unit in Tokyo was slightly below $1,000 a month—a figure that has remained virtually unchanged over the past decade, according to statistics from Japan's Real Estate Transaction Promotion Center, a nonprofit organization that provides industry research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan's current level of housing supply is tied to a package of policy changes—implemented around the turn of the century—that were aimed at restoring the profitability of Japan's land-development industry, according to Andre Sorensen, a professor of urban geography and a Japan housing expert at the <span class="companylink">University of Toronto</span> Scarborough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Japanese government began relaxing regulations that had restricted supply, allowing taller and denser buildings in Japan's capital. Private consultants were given permission to issue building permits to speed up construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This created something like a free-trade zone in Tokyo," Mr. Sorensen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately for other countries wrangling with housing affordability crises, the Japanese formula is not easily exportable. Many of the cities where demand for housing is the stiffest—New York, London, San Francisco and Stockholm, for example—impose strict rules on land use and new construction, partly due to local political pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in Japan, the responsibility of regulating urban space largely shifted to the central government in 2002 under the Urban Renaissance policy. Mr. Sorensen said it had held at bay the "not in my backyard" movements that often inhibit housing construction in the U.S. through their influence over local governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of Japan's largest housing construction companies, <span class="companylink">Daiwa House Industry Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">Sekisui House Ltd</span>., both say that the easing of land and construction regulations has helped them build in Tokyo. The companies say that deregulation has benefited them particularly in their ability to expand housing units by replacing low-rise residential complexes with much higher ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A good environment for housing construction is being created," says Daiwa House managing executive officer Yoshinori Ariyoshi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To deal with rising construction fees, Mr. Ariyoshi says Japan may have to rely more on prefabricated homes to provide affordable housing. He estimates that about 20% of the country's homes are already being assembled in increasingly automated factories. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daiwa House is collaborating with other construction companies to develop a new 1.5 million-square-foot "town" in Tokyo's center. Consisting of 24 buildings, "Harumi Flag" is slated for completion by 2024. It is expected to house some 12,000 people in 5,632 condominiums and apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of Harumi Flag's residential towers offer ocean views from 50 floors above Tokyo Bay. The units are also likely to be roomier than typical Tokyo condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, their prices are expected to be cheaper than those in the surrounding area given the "sheer amount of inventory in an already saturated area of Tokyo," said Adam German, the vice president of business development at Housing Japan. If they're not at market prices or even a bit below, "the units will have significant trouble selling," he said. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Push," a documentary by Swedish director Fredrik Gertten, is set to have its North American premiere later this month at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival. The film follows Leilani Farha, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on adequate housing, as she investigates the causes behind rapidly rising house prices and rents globally. In an interview, Mr. Gertten discusses his theories behind rising housing costs and their implications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The following was edited for clarity and brevity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What prompted you to make this film?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In my work, I travel the world, and I've noticed that people all over the world are talking about the stress around housing. Every young person talks about this stress. Every parent talks about this stress. It's getting more expensive everywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It looks like the only place where people will be able to live affordably are places without any jobs, without decent schools, without any decent service. This is very tough on people. Most people are now paying a bigger percentage of their paycheck towards their home. That goes for all of us: not only for the poor people, but also for the middle class.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When people try to explain this, they talk about gentrification. My guess was that wasn't the full story. I tried to go for a more global take in the belief that by zooming up a little bit you will see a different pattern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What did you discover as you made the film?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I started to do this film, I didn't know about the role of the hedge funds. The 2008 financial crisis totally changed the game. They bought a lot of foreclosed properties in the U.S., mostly single-family homes. Now they are out looking for undervalued properties. They are buying up places where the poorest people live. They are fixing up apartments, and they push the rents up 50%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one way they are only middlemen. The people who are investing are probably pension funds and others, and of course they want the return. And the only way to create the return is to promise profits, and that's by raising the rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a lot of money floating in. It has consequences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't civil-sector workers and union workers benefit from those returns?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My own pension fund is invested in [the funds.] Maybe I will get a better return on my pension. But on the other hand, if my cost of living is more expensive, what's the point? I think it's time to look into that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are we seeing any sort of an unintended consequence to the housing crisis?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When <span class="companylink">Google</span> started to look into establishing in Berlin's Kreuzberg section, the residential rents went up 70%. There was also the fight in New York with <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>. It's kind of sad that we're in a moment where new jobs coming in are regarded as a threat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Europe, people say, 'It's green enough. We don't want a new park. We don't want a new bike lane.' That's because they know that the prices will go up. It's really sad. We need sustainable cities, but these should also be socially sustainable.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>1012 words</div><div>1 April 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spring home-buying season is shaping up as the best in years, offering new opportunities after last year's tough housing market drove away many would-be buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of economic factors that slowed sales in 2018 have eased or even reversed in recent weeks. Mortgage rates have been falling, home inventory is rising in many once-tight markets and the pace of home-price growth is slowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These more favorable conditions are already bringing price cuts and fewer of the bidding wars that left many buyers empty-handed, recent data show. The housing market had become so skewed toward sellers that many buyers were giving up, causing sales to drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, a shift toward buyers bodes well for higher sales activity as the crucial spring selling season heats up. About 40% of the year's sales take place from March through June, making these months pivotal for the housing market each year, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's been a rough go for home buyers since the bottom of the housing market and there are signs we're entering a period of normalcy," said Ralph McLaughlin, deputy chief economist at CoreLogic Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evan Busteed, a 28-year-old attorney in Philadelphia, has been looking for a home off and on for a year and started looking seriously in January. In the trendy Fishtown neighborhood, he found homes that looked overpriced and had sat on the market for weeks. He saw about seven places between January and mid-March that fit his criteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then suddenly, on the first day of spring things shifted. Mr. Busteed saw seven places in one March weekend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My phone was exploding with notifications about places going on the market," he said. "Once I find the right thing and I'm serious about it, if one of these turns into a bidding war where I can't afford it, it's not like there's a lack of inventory."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McLaughlin at <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> said conditions could be the most favorable to home buyers since the housing market bottomed in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has fallen to just over 4%, from a high of nearly 5% last fall, after posting its largest one-week decline in a decade, according to data released by <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> on Thursday. Mortgage brokers and real-estate agents are sending out emails to clients heralding the drop in rates, which could bring even more prospective buyers off the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth has slowed for 10 consecutive months. Average prices in major U.S. metropolitan areas are now rising about 4% year over year, compared with 6% a year ago, according to the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scarcity of supply is also easing. The number of houses and apartments for sale has risen 7% from December 2017, when that figure hit its lowest level in more than four years, according to real-estate brokerage Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A successful spring could support a housing market that declined sharply in the latter half of 2018, despite stronger U.S. economic growth that boosted consumer and business confidence. Now, a rebounding housing market could help ease concerns that economic growth is slowing as job growth has cooled and the stock market has been volatile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, economists caution that even as activity picks up, a return to a period of booming home sales is unlikely. Nationally home prices have risen more than 50% since the bottom of the market in 2012, according to the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has made affordability a challenge for many buyers. Home sales tumbled more than 7% in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, making 2018 the weakest year since 2015. While inventory is increasing in many markets, it isn't necessarily because more people are putting homes on the market, economists said. Rather, homes are taking longer to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All the signs are pointing to the fact that people are just having a harder time selling their homes," said Issi Romem, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that means more-recent buyers are starting to reach deals faster: The time it takes a buyer to find a home is now 73 days, a six-year low, Redfin data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most dramatic turn has been on the West Coast, where price growth has slowed after soaring over the past five years. The rising number of homes on the market has braked that ascent. Inventory in Seattle, for example, doubled in February compared with a year earlier; it was up more than 80% in the San Jose, Calif., metro area, according to Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other major markets like Philadelphia also are experiencing a shift to the buyer. Home searches in the city were nearly one month shorter in the three months ended in February this year compared with a year earlier, according to Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 17% of offers written by Redfin agents in Philadelphia faced a bidding war in March 2019, compared with 47% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pete Rossi, a Redfin agent in the city, said on average his clients are buying homes for about 3% below the listing price, whereas a year ago many were facing bidding wars in which properties usually go for more than the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The inventory is going to be the best it's been in a long time," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists and real-estate agents caution that for those planning to resell a home in a few years now may still be a risky time to buy given that the market appears to be heading for a longer-term slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People know that the seven-year run isn't going to be here forever," said Mike McCann, an associate broker at Keller Williams Philly. "It's a good time to buy as long as long you're going to stay in the property five-plus years."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of new homes in the U.S. increased for the second month in a row in February, a positive sign after a weak stretch for the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes—a relatively narrow slice of all U.S. home sales—rose 4.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 667,000 in February, the Commerce Department  said Friday [https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf]. This is the highest level since last March. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 2.1% rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were up 0.6% in February from the prior year. The pace of new-home sales remains well below the elevated levels seen before the 2007-09 financial crisis and recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales rose in all regions in the U.S. but the West, where sales were flat. Sales of new homes in the South hit the highest level in more than a decade. Despite the recent uptick in sales, the months' supply of new homes for sale on the market was 6.1, up from 5.4 last February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the broader housing market, inventory has been tight, driving a run-up in home prices and keeping some potential buyers off the market. Meantime, construction-labor shortages and rising input costs are pushing up the overall cost of buying both new and used homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling mortgage rates and a recent deceleration in home-price growth are two bright spots for the market, which could have helped drive a large jump in sales of previously owned home in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of U.S. home-builder confidence stabilized in March after increasing two months in a row, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>'s Housing Market Index.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of new homes ramped up at the start of 2019, in a positive sign after a weak stretch for the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes—a relatively narrow slice of all U.S. home sales—rose 4.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 667,000 in February, the Commerce Department said Friday[https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf]. That is the highest level since last March and marks a significant upturn in new-home sales after being largely flat throughout 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales rose in all regions in the U.S. except in the West, where sales were flat. Sales of new homes in the South hit their highest level in more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a welcome bounce back for new home sales…and adds another hill onto the roller-coaster few months the new housing market has experienced," said John Pataky, executive vice president at TIAA Bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts think rising inventory and concomitant falling prices for new homes are driving demand for freshly built properties in certain parts of the country. In February there was a 6.1 months' supply of new homes for sale on the market at the current sales pace, up from 5.4 in February 2018. The median sale price of a new home on the market was down 3.6% in February from the prior year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More broadly, inventory has been tight, running up home prices and keeping some potential buyers out of the search. Meantime, construction-labor shortages and rising input costs are pushing up the overall costs of buying both new and used homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling mortgage rates are a bright spot, along with a tight labor market that continues to add jobs and is increasing wages at the fastest pace in the current business cycle. This could have helped drive a large jump in sales of previously owned homes in February. These so-called existing-home sales, which make up the bulk of home purchases in the U.S. economy, have been down year-over-year for months.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"New home sales have performed much better over the past year than existing sales, perhaps because a much smaller proportion of new sales take place in the high-tax states of the Northeast and elsewhere," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax law changes made in late 2017 capped some deductions that benefit owners of pricier homes, making the overall price of buying a house more expensive in areas such as New York City and Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales were up a slim 0.6% in February from the prior year, and their pace remains well below the elevated levels seen before the 2007-09 financial crisis and recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Moving ahead, labor market strength and the recent sharp decline in mortgage rates will provide support for housing demand, but overall affordability and a general feeling that prices are softening and there is no hurry to buy will work in the other direction," Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at MFR, said in a note to clients this morning.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth slowed for the 10th straight month in January, providing critical relief to buyers heading into the spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 4.3% in the year ending in January [https://www.spice-indices.com/idpfiles/spice-assets/resources/public/documents/897961_cshomeprice-release-0326.pdf], down from 4.6% the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slower price growth, along with lower mortgage rates and a growing inventory of homes for sale, are all potentially good news for home buyers this spring. Nonetheless, prices in most places are continuing to rise, meaning affordability remains a challenge for many first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The national housing market's ongoing, slow march back to normal is continuing into the start of 2019 and setting up a spring in which buyers will have more power than they have in years," said Zillow Economic Analyst Matthew Speakman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller 10-city index gained 3.2% over the year ending in January, down from a 3.7% annual change in December. The 20-city index gained 3.6%, after an annual gain of 4.1% in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once-hot housing markets on the West Coast, such as Seattle and San Francisco, have slowed sharply in recent months. In Seattle, annual price gains dropped from nearly 13% in January 2018 to just over 4% in January 2019. San Francisco saw annual price increases shrink from just over 10% to less than 2% over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead the new drivers of the American housing market are primarily places in the South that are trying to make up significant ground lost during the bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas had the fastest home-price growth in the country for the eighth straight month, at 10.5%. Phoenix had the second-fastest price growth at 7.5%, followed by Minneapolis at 5.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, most housing markets in the country are now slowing. Of the 20 cities tracked by Case Shiller, only Phoenix saw an appreciable acceleration in home price growth in January 2019 compared with January 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market slowed sharply in the fall, when mortgage rates neared 5% and home prices were growing by more than 5%—both making it more difficult for buyers to afford homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate for a 30-year mortgage fell to 4.28% last week, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That has helped boost existing home sales, which jumped 11.8% in February compared with a month earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While 2018 started with a real-estate frenzy and ended with a fizzle, 2019's slow start could pick up the pace later in the year," said Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—A gauge of home construction and queued up projects declined in February and are pulling back this year overall, with a slew of factors, including the government shutdown and housing affordability, potentially impacting the data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So-called housing starts fell 8.7% in February from the prior month, the Commerce Department said Tuesday  [https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf]. This largely reversed solid gains seen in January. Meanwhile, residential building permits, which can signal how much construction is in the pipeline, dropped 1.6% in February after declining in January too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taken together, the two gauges signal construction and authorized building projects are hiccuping at the start of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-starts data are volatile from month to month and can be subject to large revisions. February's 8.7% decline for starts came with a margin of error of 10.3 percentage points. Still, a sturdier gauge of housing starts shows home construction is softening. Starts were down 8.2% in the first two months of 2019 when compared with the same period a year earlier. Permits were down 1.9% on a year-to-date basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The partial government shutdown that spanned from the end of last December to January of this year could have been a factor in the soft data. The Commerce Department said the response rates for the starts report were "consistent with normal levels," but "delays in data collection for December and January could make it more difficult to determine exact start and completion dates" for properties. This could have caused the significant revisions to the data in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the U.S. has experienced a relatively steady stream of extreme weather in recent months, including wildfires last summer and at the end of 2018, hurricanes last fall, then harsh winter weather at the beginning of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's been over half a year since we had a ‘clean' reading," according to Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the key ingredients for strong housing demand are in place. A gauge of layoffs across the country remains historically low, and wages are growing at the fastest pace in the current economic cycle. Demographics should be a boon to the housing market, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Household formations have grown rapidly—and since every household must live somewhere and vacancy rates are low, this would induce more housing starts," said Nationwide Chief Economist David Berson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, rising costs for builders, including growing wages for construction workers, pose challenges for some home builders attempting to construct lower-priced properties to meet demand. Other challenges include lack of available land and high zoning and regulatory standards in some parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has helped lead to a runup in home prices in parts of the country and a pullback in the broader housing market throughout 2018, as some home buyers are increasingly priced out. Rising mortgage rates last year were another factor driving up the overall cost of buying a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at MFR, said there's a general belief that the "single-family housing cycle has seen its peak and that buyers can step back and let the market come to them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That housing pullback last year led to a deceleration in home-price growth, which could encourage some home buyers to start looking again, for both new and previously-owned homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of U.S. home-builder confidence stabilized in March after increasing two months in a row, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> 's Housing Market Index. This survey showed sentiment falling throughout 2018. Lower mortgage rates, which lower the overall cost of buying a home for consumers, helped turn sentiment around in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If buyers decide to take decisive action in this period of flat rates and decelerating cost growth, we could see the market pick up as spring homebuying season gets under way," said John Pataky, executive vice president at TIAA Bank.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Harriet Torry and Sharon Nunn </div><div>614 words</div><div>22 March 2019</div><div>10:04</div><div>WSJ Pro Central Banking</div><div>RSTPROCB</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2019, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of previously owned homes rose strongly in February, a sign that demand for housing picked up as mortgage rates eased last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales rose 11.8% in February from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.51 million, the National Association of Realtors said Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected sales would rise 3.2% to a rate of 5.1 million in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with a year earlier, sales in February were down 1.8%. Existing-home sales were revised slightly lower for January, to an annual rate of 4.93 million after also declining in December and November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said there were 1.63 million existing homes available for sale at the end of February, up 3.2% from a year earlier and representing a 3.5-month supply at the current sales pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Lawrence Yun , the association's chief economist, said the latest data represent a "powerful recovery" in existing home sales, driven by lower interest rates and increased inventory.  A strong labor market  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-jobless-claims-declined-in-mid-march-11553171566?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=6]and wage growth are also underpinning the housing market, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 11.8% month-over-month gain represented the strongest percentage increase since December 2015, according to Mr. Yun. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.51 million was last matched in March of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The February data indicated housing could be poised to recover this spring after starting the first quarter on a rocky footing. Sales of new homes in the U.S. fell 6.9% in January from the prior month, the Commerce Department said last week. Still, the number of existing homes that went under contract in the U.S. rose strongly in January, NAR said last month, a sign of improvement for the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year was the weakest for home sales since 2015. Buyers pulled back in the latter half of 2018, as rising mortgage rates, high home prices, a volatile stock market, concerns that prices would start declining and anxiety about the national political situation all caused a number of buyers to hit pause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median sale price for a previously owned home last month was $249,500, up 3.6% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were flat on the month in the Northeast, but increased 9.5% in the Midwest. In the West, sales rose 16% in February from January. The South saw sales rise by 14.9% from January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strong job market and wage growth all bode well for the housing market currently, although relatively low inventory and high prices could curb those solid fundamentals somewhat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of U.S. home-builder confidence stabilized in March after two consecutive monthly increases. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said earlier this week that its index of builder confidence in the market for new single-family homes remained unchanged from a month earlier at 62 in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates were on the rise for most of 2018, but cooled at the turn of the year. The average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 4.28% the week ended March 21, down from 4.51% in the first week of January, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> .</p>

</p><div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">MANSION --- Retirement Living: Too Many Too Big Homes --- Baby boomers and retirees who built grand homes across the Sunbelt are finding it difficult to sell them.</span>
</div><div class="author">By Candace Taylor </div><div>1253 words</div><div>22 March 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large, high-end homes across the Sunbelt are sitting on the market, enduring deep price cuts to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a far different picture than 15 years ago, when retirees were rushing to build elaborate, five-or six-bedroom houses in warm climates, fueled in part by the easy credit of the real-estate boom. Many baby boomers poured millions into these spacious homes, planning to live out their golden years in houses with all the bells and whistles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, many boomers are discovering that these large, high-maintenance houses no longer fit their needs as they grow older, but younger people aren't buying them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tastes -- and access to credit -- have shifted dramatically since the early 2000s. Buyers of all ages now eschew the large, ornate houses built in those years in favor of smaller, more-modern looking alternatives, and prefer walkable areas to living miles from retail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is especially acute in areas with large clusters of retirees. In North Carolina's Buncombe County, which draws retirees with its mild climate and Blue Ridge Mountain scenery, there are 34 homes priced over $2 million on the market, but only 16 sold in that price range in the past year, said Marilyn Wright, an agent at Premier Sotheby's International Realty in Asheville.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area around Scottsdale, Ariz., also popular with wealthy retirees, had 349 homes on the market at or above $3 million as of February 1 -- an all-time high, according to a <span class="companylink">Walt Danley Realty</span> report. Homes built before 2012 are selling at steep discounts -- sometimes almost 50%, and many owners end up selling for less than they paid to build their homes, said Walt Danley 's Dub Dellis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kiawah Island, a South Carolina beach community, currently has around 225 houses for sale, which amounts to a three- or four-year supply. Of those, the larger and more expensive homes are the hardest to sell, especially if they haven't been renovated recently, according to local real-estate agent Pam Harrington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is expected to worsen in the 2020s, as more baby boomers across the country advance into their 70s and 80s, the age group where people typically exit homeownership due to poor health or death, said Dowell Myers, co-author of a 2018 <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> report, "The Coming Exodus of Older Homeowners." Boomers currently own 32 million homes and account for two out of five homeowners in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You had this wave of homes built that now just don't make sense for a lot of the people who bought them," said Rick Palacios, Jr. of <span class="companylink">John Burns Real Estate Consulting</span> .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For their retirement in a suburb of Asheville, N.C., Ben and Valentina Bethell spent about $3.5 million in 2009 to build their dream home: a roughly 7,500-square-foot, European-style house with a commanding view of the Blue Ridge Mountains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bethells said they love the home but it now feels too big, especially since their adult son visits only about once a year. Plus, tasks like pulling garbage cans up the steep, 100-yard-long driveway have become onerous, said Mr. Bethell, 78. "It's a lot to do."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple listed the home in 2015 for $4.495 million, and have since reduced the price to $3.995 million. When the house does sell, they plan to buy a newly constructed, smaller house nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After retiring 15 years ago, Robin and David Saltman moved from New Jersey to Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., where they spent over a year building their dream house with a pool on the ocean. Then in their 50s, the couple planned to stay in the three-story, five-bedroom house at least until their 80s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, they sold the roughly 4,200-square-foot house last year. Though they had an elevator, "it was still running up and down the stairs a million times a day," said Ms. Saltman, 70. They also wanted to be closer to town; the house was about a 20-minute drive from the nearest stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most high-end homes in the area sit on the market for at least a year, the Saltmans were able to sell their home -- into which they'd invested about $1.75 million -- in a few months for $2.1 million, with the help of their son Andrew, a real-estate agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its place they bought a newer, four-bedroom house on the Intracoastal Waterway. Though it is nearly 6,000-square-feet, all the major living areas are on one floor, and it is only five minutes from town. They paid $1.8 million for the new house, then spent "a couple hundred thousand" renovating it. Overall, "we were happy," Ms. Saltman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George and Diana Hambleton are selling their house on South Carolina's Wadmalaw Island, about 20 minutes outside Charleston, only four years after they finished building it. An interior designer, Ms. Hambleton selected the materials for the roughly 4,200-square-foot house, including reclaimed barn wood and Wisconsin flagstone. But they are selling the approximately three-acre property because they want "somewhere smaller where someone's taking care of everything," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple, who relocated from New Jersey, will likely move into an apartment in Charleston. Mr. Hambleton is "a very young 89," his wife said, and when they built the house, "he was only 82," so the property's upkeep "didn't seem like that major a thing." But when it comes to aging, she added, "I don't know that you face these things until you have to."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After spending just under $3 million to build the home, they initially put it on the market for $2.99 million in 2016; the price is now $1.975 million. Ms. Hambleton, 74, said it would most likely sell for less than the cost of building it. "We will take a little bit of a hit," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hambleton said they are frequently asked why they built the house, only to sell it so shortly afterward. "The answer is, because we wanted to," she said. "We've loved being here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SELLING POINTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Design trends have shifted radically in the past decade. That means a home with crown moldings, ornate details and Mediterranean or Tuscan-style architecture can be a hard sell, while properties with clean lines and open floor plans get snapped up. To help sell an older home in the current market, Florida real-estate agent Rose Sklar said it is crucial to make the property look as updated as possible. She recommended renovating the house before putting it on the market, especially the kitchen and bathrooms. If a renovation isn't in the cards financially, there are other small steps that can make a big difference, she said: remove dated drapes and curtains, repaint the kitchen cabinets, and change out hardware and light fixtures for a more contemporary look. The replacements "don't have to be expensive -- just get something that's 'today,'" Ms. Sklar said. "Get rid of the datedness of the house." Stage the house with rental furniture if possible, and remove all family photos and other personal items to help buyers envision themselves there. Finally: "If you have a pet, hide it," she said. "Everybody's allergic to everything."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ben Eisen and Laura Kusisto </div><div>714 words</div><div>22 March 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-end home buyers are turning cautious, a blow to banks that refocused their mortgage businesses around wealthy borrowers in the years after the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Originations for jumbo mortgages, which are loans too big to be sold to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, dropped 12% last year by dollar volume, outpacing the 7% decline in mortgages that meet the standards for Fannie and Freddie's government backing. The $281 billion in jumbo originations was off 27% from its postcrisis peak two years earlier, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry research group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jumbo loans have been a bright spot for banks. Many financial institutions, stung during the housing crisis by mortgages made to buyers who ultimately couldn't repay, pulled back from the market except for the portion that catered to high-end customers. Additionally, banks found that making and servicing the loans was a good entry point to sell more services to those customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most parts of the country, a jumbo is any loan above $484,350, though in the most expensive areas a jumbo is above $726,525.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These high-cost mortgages dominate the market in expensive cities. In Manhattan, for example, 61% of purchase mortgages last year qualified as jumbo, according to housing-research firm Attom Data Solutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But recent trends have hit the high end of the market disproportionately, testing banks' postcrisis strategy. Refinancings have cooled because many borrowers who were eligible to refinance have already done so, and rates would have to fall sharply to make it worthwhile for them to do so again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices, while still rising annually, are cooling. A slowing U.S. economy and new tax laws that reduce the incentives to buy big homes also hurt the jumbo market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high-end slowdown is bringing into sharp focus how hiccups in the housing industry can ripple throughout the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baby boomers and retirees who want to downsize are having trouble selling their dream houses. In New York City, some wealthy homeowners are finding that their homes sit on the market for weeks or months longer than they expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown could also signal that would-be younger borrowers in expensive cities like New York City and San Francisco are no longer willing to stomach continually rising home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices have gotten so expensive in some of these coastal markets, there are fewer buyers that can afford these prices," said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at real-estate brokerage Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales for the top 5% of the market fell 10% in February from a year earlier, while sales overall stayed essentially flat, according to Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The banks' postcrisis push toward wealthier borrowers contrasts with nonbank lenders that have grown rapidly since the crisis, often by focusing on first-time or moderate-income borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jumbos made up almost one-fifth of the mortgage originations at banks with more than $10 billion in assets in 2017, versus about 7% of business for nonbanks, according to ComplianceTech's LendingPatterns.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks that did more than half their U.S. mortgage business in jumbo loans last year include <span class="companylink">First Republic Bank</span>, <span class="companylink">MUFG Union Bank</span>, <span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion Bank</span> and <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>., according to Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives at <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and <span class="companylink">Union Bank</span>, which is a subsidiary of Tokyo-based <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc</span>., said their companies' businesses skew naturally toward jumbo borrowers because of where their client bases are concentrated, such as in expensive parts of the West Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, both banks have sought to focus more on borrowers taking out smaller loans, they said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jumbo-loan business tends to be heavy on refinancing because a small drop in rates can make a big difference on large mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as rates rose last year, the refinance market effectively shut down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for higher-end homes are still rising, but at a slower pace than less expensive ones. On the most expensive third of U.S. homes, list prices rose about 6% since the end of 2017, while the middle third grew by about 9% and the bottom third jumped 16%, according to online real-estate company <span class="companylink">Zillow Group Inc</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large, high-end homes across the Sunbelt are sitting on the market, enduring deep price cuts to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a far different picture than 15 years ago, when retirees were rushing to build elaborate, five or six-bedroom houses in warm climates, fueled in part by the easy credit of the real estate boom. Many baby boomers poured millions into these spacious homes, planning to live out their golden years in houses with all the bells and whistles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, many boomers are discovering that these large, high-maintenance houses no longer fit their needs as they grow older, but younger people aren't buying them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tastes—and access to credit—have shifted dramatically since the early 2000s. These days, buyers of all ages eschew the large, ornate houses built in those years in favor of smaller, more-modern looking alternatives, and prefer walkable areas to living miles from retail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is especially acute in areas with large clusters of retirees. In North Carolina's Buncombe County, which draws retirees with its mild climate and Blue Ridge Mountain scenery, there are 34 homes priced over $2 million on the market, but only 16 sold in that price range in the past year, said Marilyn Wright, an agent at Premier Sotheby's International Realty in Asheville.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area around Scottsdale, Ariz., also popular with wealthy retirees, had 349 homes on the market at or above $3 million as of February 1—an all-time high, according to a <span class="companylink">Walt Danley Realty</span> report. Homes built before 2012 are selling at steep discounts—sometimes almost 50%, and many owners end up selling for less than they paid to build their homes, said Walt Danley's Dub Dellis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kiawah Island, a South Carolina beach community, currently has around 225 houses for sale, which amounts to a three- or four-year supply. Of those, the larger and more expensive homes are the hardest to sell, especially if they haven't been renovated recently, according to local real-estate agent Pam Harrington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is expected to worsen in the 2020s, as more baby boomers across the country advance into their 70s and 80s, the age group where people typically exit homeownership due to poor health or death, said Dowell Myers, co-author of a 2018 <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> report, "The Coming Exodus of Older Homeowners." Boomers currently own 32 million homes and account for two out of five homeowners in the country. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Saltmans, seen here with Devy, moved to a home where all the major living areas are on one floor. PHOTO: Betsy Hansen for The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You had this wave of homes built that now just don't make sense for a lot of the people who bought them," said Rick Palacios, Jr. of John Burns Real Estate Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For their retirement in a suburb of Asheville, N.C., Ben and Valentina Bethell spent about $3.5 million in 2009 to build their dream home: a roughly 7,500-square-foot, European-style house with a commanding view of the Blue Ridge Mountains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bethells said they love the home but it now feels too big, especially since their adult son visits only about once a year. Plus, tasks like pulling garbage cans up the steep, 100-yard-long driveway have become onerous, said Mr. Bethell, 78. "It's a lot to do."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple listed the home in 2015 for $4.495 million, and have since reduced the price to $3.995 million. When the house does sell, they plan to buy a newly constructed, smaller house nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After retiring 15 years ago, Robin and David Saltman moved from New Jersey to Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., where they spent more than a year custom-building their dream house with a pool on the ocean. Then in their 50s, the couple planned to stay in the three-story, five-bedroom house at least until their 80s. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, they sold the roughly 4,200-square-foot house last year. Though they had an elevator, "it was still running up and down the stairs a million times a day," said Ms. Saltman, 70. They also wanted to be closer to town; the house was about a 20-minute drive from the nearest stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most high-end homes in the area sit on the market for at least a year, the Saltmans were able to sell their home—into which they'd invested about $1.75 million—in a few months for $2.1 million, with the help of their son Andrew, a real-estate agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its place they bought a newer, four-bedroom house on the Intracoastal Waterway. Though it is nearly 6,000 square feet, all the major living areas are on one floor, and it is located only five minutes from town. They paid $1.8 million for the new house, then spent "a couple hundred thousand" renovating it. Overall, "we were happy," Ms. Saltman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George and Diana Hambleton are selling their house on South Carolina's Wadmalaw Island, about 20 minutes outside Charleston, only four years after they finished building it. An interior designer, Ms. Hambleton selected the materials for the roughly 4,200-square-foot house, including reclaimed barn wood and Wisconsin flagstone. But they are selling the approximately 3-acre property, which they loved for its creekfront location and mature oak trees, because they want "somewhere smaller where someone's taking care of everything," she said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bethells said they love the home but it now feels too big, and tasks like pulling garbage cans up the long driveway have become onerous. They listed the home in 2015 for $4.495 million, and have since reduced the price to $3.995 million. PHOTO: Erin Adams for The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple, who relocated there from New Jersey, will likely move into an apartment in Charleston. Mr. Hambleton is "a very young 89," his wife said, and when they built the house, "he was only 82," so the property's upkeep "didn't seem like that major a thing." But when it comes to aging, she added, "I don't know that you face these things until you have to."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After spending just under $3 million to build the home, they initially put it on the market for $2.99 million in 2016; the price is now $1.975 million. Ms. Hambleton, 74, said it would most likely sell for less than the cost of building it. "We will take a little bit of a hit," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hambleton said they are frequently asked why they built the house, only to sell it so shortly afterward. "The answer is, because we wanted to," she said. "We've loved being here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Selling Points</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Design trends have shifted radically in the past decade. That means a home with crown moldings, ornate details and Mediterranean or Tuscan-style architecture can be a hard sell, while properties with clean lines and open floor plans get snapped up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help sell an older home in the current market, Florida real-estate agent Rose Sklar said it is crucial to make the property look as updated as possible. She recommended renovating the house before putting it on the market, especially the kitchen and bathrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a renovation isn't in the cards financially, there are other small steps that can make a big difference, she said: remove dated drapes and curtains, repaint the kitchen cabinets, and change out hardware and light fixtures for a more contemporary look.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The replacements "don't have to be expensive—just get something that's 'today,'" Ms. Sklar said. "Get rid of the datedness of the house." Stage the house with rental furniture if possible, and remove all family photos and other personal items to help buyers envision themselves there. Finally: "If you have a pet, hide it," she said. "Everybody's allergic to everything."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-end home buyers are turning cautious, a blow to banks that refocused their mortgage businesses around wealthy borrowers in the years after the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Originations for jumbo mortgages, which are loans too big to be sold to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, dropped 12% last year by dollar volume, outpacing the 7% decline in mortgages that meet the standards for Fannie and Freddie's government backing. The $281 billion in jumbo originations was off 27% from its postcrisis peak two years earlier, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry research group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These high-dollar loans have been a bright spot for banks[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/tax-law-could-slow-down-a-bank-favorite-jumbo-mortgages-1514302800]. Many financial institutions, stung during the housing crisis by mortgages made to buyers who ultimately couldn't repay, pulled back from the market except for the portion that catered to high-end customers[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/banks-embrace-of-jumbo-mortgages-means-fewer-loans-for-blacks-hispanics-1464789752]. Additionally, banks found that making and servicing the loans was a good entry point to sell more services to those customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But recent trends have hit the high end of the market disproportionately, testing the banks' postcrisis strategy. Refinancings have cooled because many borrowers who were eligible to refinance have already done so, and rates would have to fall sharply to make it worthwhile for them to do so again. Home prices, while still rising annually, are cooling. A slowing U.S. economy and new tax laws that reduce the incentives[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/what-the-tax-bill-does-to-homeowners-1513737287] to buy big homes are also hurting the jumbo market. The changes are weakening a key support for the housing industry and broader U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high-end slowdown is bringing into sharp focus how hiccups in the housing industry can ripple throughout the economy. Baby boomers and retirees who want to downsize are having trouble[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/a-growing-problem-in-real-estate-too-many-too-big-houses-11553181782] selling their dream houses. In New York City, some wealthy homeowners are finding that their homes sit on the market[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/new-yorks-wealthiest-cut-losses-as-manhattan-real-estate-falters-1543508960] for weeks or months longer than they expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown could also signal that would-be younger borrowers in expensive cities like New York City and San Francisco are no longer willing to stomach continually rising home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alec Traub, a Los Angeles-based real-estate agent, said he has been counseling luxury home sellers to price their properties a little bit below what they think is fair value. Amy Downs, a real-estate agent at <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> in Dallas, said high-end sellers have to be willing to make improvements to their homes. On $1 million properties, buyers can negotiate as much as $100,000 off the asking price, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices have gotten so expensive in some of these coastal markets, there are fewer buyers that can afford these prices," said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at real-estate brokerage Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales for the top 5% of the market fell 10% in February from a year earlier, while sales overall stayed essentially flat, according to Redfin.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most parts of the country, a jumbo is any loan above $484,350, though in the most expensive areas a jumbo is above $726,525.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These high-cost mortgages dominate the market in expensive cities. In Manhattan, for example, 61% of purchase mortgages last year qualified as jumbo per that year's loan limits, according to housing-research firm Attom Data Solutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The banks' postcrisis push toward wealthier borrowers contrasts with nonbank lenders[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-new-mortgage-kings-theyre-not-banks-1536242400] that have grown rapidly since the crisis, often by focusing on first-time or moderate-income borrowers. Jumbos made up almost one-fifth of the mortgage originations at banks with more than $10 billion in assets in 2017, versus about 7% of business for nonbanks, according to ComplianceTech's LendingPatterns.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks that did more than half their U.S. mortgage business in jumbo loans last year include <span class="companylink">First Republic Bank</span>, <span class="companylink">MUFG Union Bank</span>, <span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion Bank</span> and <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>., according to Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives at <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and <span class="companylink">Union Bank</span>, which is a subsidiary of Tokyo-based <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc</span>., say their companies' businesses skew naturally toward jumbo borrowers because of where their client bases are concentrated, such as in expensive parts of the West Coast. Recently, both banks have sought to focus more on borrowers taking out smaller loans, they say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jumbo loan business tends to be heavy on refinancing because a small drop in rates can make a big difference on large mortgage payments. "It doesn't take much of a rate move on larger loans to make the cost to transact make sense," said Rick Bechtel, the head of U.S. residential lending at TD Bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as rates rose last year, the refinance market effectively shut down[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/homeowners-ditch-refinancings-as-mortgage-rates-rise-1522062001].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for higher-end homes are still rising, but at a slower pace than less expensive ones. On the most expensive third of U.S. homes, list prices rose about 6% since the end of 2017, while the middle third grew about 9% and the bottom third jumped 16%, according to online real-estate company <span class="companylink">Zillow Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During an otherwise upbeat 2018 for financial earnings[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/big-banks-find-sweet-spot-in-higher-rates-11547582951?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=11], mortgage-banking profitability among the top 24 banks that report it dropped 19% from a year earlier, according to Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there are few signs banks are changing tack. If anything, industry watchers say, they are becoming more competitive. Banks tend to keep jumbo loans on their balance sheets rather than selling them to investors, which means they can offer lower rates without worrying about whether that will make the loans less attractive to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin Leibowitz, the founder of Brooklyn, N.Y.-based Grayton Mortgage Inc., a nonbank lender and broker, said that it is tough to outmaneuver banks in the jumbo market. This month, he was asked to price a roughly $900,000 mortgage for a second home in California. He offered a rate of 4.375%, but couldn't beat <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>'s 4%, which included the potential to drop it to 3.875% if the borrower also deposited $250,000 at the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I can't compete with crazy," Mr. Leibowitz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Had Eric Nadler and his wife chosen to purchase an apartment in Manhattan when they moved to the city from the suburbs last year, they likely would have taken out a jumbo loan. But instead, the empty-nesters decided to rent. Mr. Nadler, an angel investor, said a series of quick tallies on a mortgage calculator showed renting to be a more reasonable option given the length of time they were willing to commit to living in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new tax law reinforced their decision because it would have cut the size of their deduction, effectively increasing the cost to own. "There was no reason to take on more tax liability," Mr. Nadler said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leonard Steinberg, a broker at Compass in New York City, said the market in New York began slowing down shortly after the 2016 election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Mr. Steinberg said, the high-end rental market is booming as many consumers wait and see if the market cools further. An agent at his firm recently had three offers in six hours for a $40,000-per-month, five-bedroom rental unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a little bit of fear that some recession is coming in the next year or two and there will be more opportunities to buy cheap," Mr. Steinberg said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building in the U.S. rose robustly in January, a sign the housing market gained momentum in early 2019 as mortgage rates eased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 18.6% in January from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.230 million, the Commerce Department said Friday. Residential building permits, which can signal how much construction is in the pipeline, rose a more modest 1.4% from December to an annual pace of 1.345 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite volatility in recent months, Mike Fratantoni, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, said that a 4.5% year-over-year increase in single-family units is a promising sign for the housing market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—The number of existing homes that went under contract in the U.S. rose strongly in January, a sign of improvement for the housing market at the start of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index measuring pending home sales—a gauge of purchases before they become final—rose 4.6% to a seasonally adjusted reading of 103.2 in January, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had predicted a 0.8% increase in January's sales. The index was down 2.3% in January from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December's reading was revised slightly lower, to 98.7 from an initial 99.0.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales offer a forecast of the housing market because they measure purchases at the time a contract is signed rather than at closing. Contracts typically take weeks to become final, and some are ultimately canceled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A change in Federal Reserve policy and the reopening of the government were very beneficial to the market," said Lawrence Yun , the trade group's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that rising incomes, a strong labor market and steady mortgage rates should help January's positive trend to continue.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in 2018 grew at their slowest pace in four years, while construction slumped, signaling that the housing market started this year on shaky footing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 4.7% last year. That was a significant slowdown from more than 6% in 2017 and the index's worst yearly performance since 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, housing starts dropped 11.2% in December from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.078 million, the lowest level in more than two years, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall in 2018, single-family housing starts, which measure new-home construction, were up 2.8% in 2018 -- down from 8.5% growth the prior year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two indicators are the latest sign of how much the housing market struggled in the last few months of 2018.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—The number of existing homes that went under contract in the U.S. rose strongly in January, a sign of improvement for the housing market at the start of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index measuring pending home sales—a gauge of purchases before they become final—rose 4.6% to a seasonally adjusted reading of 103.2 in January, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had predicted a 0.8% increase in January's sales. The index was down 2.3% in January from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December's reading was revised slightly lower, to 98.7 from an initial 99.0.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales offer a forecast of the housing market because they measure purchases at the time a contract is signed rather than at closing. Contracts typically take weeks to become final, and some are ultimately canceled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A change in <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> policy and the reopening of the government were very beneficial to the market," said Lawrence Yun , the trade group's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that rising incomes, a strong labor market and steady mortgage rates should help January's positive trend to continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the <span class="companylink">NAR</span> reported earlier this month that its more closely watched index—final sales of existing homes, which measure purchases after closing— fell in January [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-drop-1-2-in-january-11550762126?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=6].</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>. executives said wet weather around the country hurt quarterly sales at the home-improvement chain and, despite sounding upbeat about consumer spending, tempered growth expectations for 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was cold, it was snowy and perhaps worst of all, it was wet. Wet weather delays projects and this is evident in our sales performance," said Home Depot Chief Executive Craig Menear on a conference call. Outside weather issues, "our business performed in line with our expectations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comparable sales rose 3.2% for the quarter ended in February. Analysts polled by Consensus Metrix were expecting them to increase 4.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>'s stock fell 0.9% to close at $188.30. The stock has more than doubled over the past five years as the retailer has benefited from a strong U.S. economy and the troubles of <span class="companylink">Sears Holdings Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> said it expects comparable sales for the current fiscal year to increase by 5%. For the 2018 fiscal year, they rose 5.2%. The 2019 fiscal year will have 52 weeks. The 2018 fiscal year included an extra week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> sees a strong consumer and a housing market that favors its core business of home-improvement projects, said Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners are staying in their homes longer which drives repairs, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> isn't seeing signs of a slowdown in consumer spending, Ms. Tome said, even as some retailers reported weaker-than-expected holiday sales growth including <span class="companylink">Macy's Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">L Brands Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> reported fourth-quarter net income of $2.34 billion, up 32% from a year earlier. Net sales were $26.49 billion, up 11% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board also raised the quarterly dividend by 32% to $1.36 and authorized a new $15 billion share-repurchase program.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts tumbled in December, capping a weak year for construction of new single-family homes due to factors such as rising construction material and labor costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts dropped 11.2% in December from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.078 million, the lowest level in more than two years, the Commerce Department said Tuesday  [https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf]. Residential building permits, which can signal how much construction is in the pipeline, edged up 0.3% from November to an annual pace of 1.326 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 1.3% decrease for starts and a 2.9% decrease for permits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-starts data are volatile from month to month and can be subject to large revisions. December's 11.2% decline for starts came with a margin of error of 14.0 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home building stagnated in 2018, after steadily climbing throughout the expansion. Construction of multifamily buildings continued to ease as the market for new condominiums and apartments has cooled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department's report on housing starts in December was delayed by more than a month due to the partial government shutdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broader trend shows starts rose by 3.6% in 2018 compared with 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts were down 6.7% in December from the prior month for single-family construction and down 20.4% for buildings with two or more units compared with November. Permits in December were down 2.2% for single-family homes and up 4.9% for multifamily construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite strong economic growth and a historically low unemployment rate, factors that should support home-buyer demand, a shortage of inventory and rising borrowing costs have locked out many would-be buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While affordability remains a key concern, home-builder sentiment picked up in the first two months of this year after pulling back in much of 2018.

</div><div class="author">By Yuliya Chernova </div><div>602 words</div><div>26 February 2019</div><div>15:49</div><div>WSJ Pro Venture Capital</div><div>RSTPROVC</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2019, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, venture capitalists have flocked to home-selling startups like Opendoor and Knock, partly supported by a robust U.S. real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this new category may be about to face its biggest test yet as home prices head into their first rough patch since the companies came on the scene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investor faith in home-sales startups could be at a high point. Opendoor Labs Inc., which takes homes quickly off sellers' hands, raised some $725 million [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/softbank-invests-400-million-in-home-selling-startup-opendoor-1538042400] last year alone. Knock, which helps consumers trade in their old home for a new one, pulled in [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/real-estate-brokerage-knock-raises-series-b-11547594158] $400 million in a combination of Series B equity and debt in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of U.S. existing homes were down 1.2% [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-drop-1-2-in-january-11550762126] in January, marking the third month in a row of declines, the National Association of Realtors reported. National median home prices, meanwhile, are continuing to increase but at a slower rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked a few weeks ago whether Opendoor would be vulnerable to a weaker market, Keith Rabois, who founded the company as a general partner at <span class="companylink">Khosla Ventures</span> and who is joining Founders Fund, replied there's "zero vulnerability." Not only that, he added, "We are going to do phenomenally well in a depreciating market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That does sound very optimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just like any home buyer, companies such as Opendoor and Knock are exposed to the risk of buying high and selling low. That risk increases in a market downturn, which the cyclical real-estate market might be starting to enter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This will be the first cycle we'll go through where these data-centric [companies] will have significant exposure at scale to the housing inventory," said Rob Barber, chief executive of Attom Data Solutions, a real-estate property data company. "We will learn to what extent their use of data insulates them from the normal consequences of the ebbs and flows of the housing market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rabois's point is that Opendoor's fast, cash offers will see greater demand in a down market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When asset prices are volatile or declining, people crave liquidity even more than when the asset is appreciating," Mr. Rabois said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While true, that's not the end of the story. Greater demand doesn't necessarily translate into greater profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key to these businesses is accurately predicting where a home's price is heading after it has been purchased. But the risk of miscalculating increases in a down market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to make sure we stay ahead of where the prices are going, and that we negotiate well," said Sean Black, co-founder and CEO of Knock's parent, Knockaway Inc. He added that the company did feel some market weakness in the third and fourth quarters of 2018, but Knock's revenue kept growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since home-sales startups actually buy properties and keep them on their balance sheets, a lot of money is at stake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Whether the market is going up or down, the only question is are you valuing the asset correctly or not," Mr. Rabois said. "If you are not, you'll lose a tremendous amount."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Precisely. And while it may be "the only question," it is a crucial one. And for these emerging new players in real estate, it is a question nobody has yet answered in a down market.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in 2018 grew at their slowest pace in four years, while construction slumped, signaling that the housing market started this year on shaky footing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 4.7% in the year ending in December. That was a significant slowdown from more than 6% in 2017 and the index's worst performance for a calendar year since 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, housing starts dropped 11.2% in December from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.078 million, the lowest level in more than two years, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Overall in 2018 single-family housing starts, which measure new-home construction, were up 2.8% in 2018—down from 8.5% growth the prior year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two indicators are the latest sign of how much the housing market struggled in the last few months of 2018. Higher mortgage rates, political uncertainty, stock market turbulence and growing frustration over a lack of starter home inventory caused many buyers to pause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The critical question now is whether the market can rebound in time for the crucial spring selling season, which typically starts to gain steam in February.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This year probably isn't going to be gangbusters. It's probably not going to collapse, but it's not going to be a record year on many fronts," said Ralph McLaughlin , deputy chief economist at CoreLogic Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak housing starts could mean less new supply, leading to inventory shortages that make it difficult for buyers to find a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data also don't bode well for the Commerce Department's release of fourth-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday. Residential investment subtracted from the growth rate in the first three quarters of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forecasting firm <span class="companylink">Macroeconomic Advisers</span> lowered its fourth-quarter growth rate projection to 2.3% from 2.4% based on weaker-than-expected December single-family housing starts and permits. The firm said that the sluggish home construction figures suggest less growth in residential investment in the fourth quarter, as well as in the first.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investment Falters</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A widely watched measure of how much businesses are investing fell for the fourth time in five months at the end of 2018, signaling firms are feeling less confident in light of domestic and global economic uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall orders for durable goods, manufactured products intended to last at least three years, rose a seasonally adjusted 1.2% in December from the prior month, the Commerce Department said Thursday. This was largely driven by ramped up commercial aircraft and parts orders, and orders for vehicles and vehicle parts. When removing transportation, orders grew at a weaker 0.1% pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The underlying business-investment gauge, new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, declined 0.7% in December, the fourth decline since August 2018. Growth in the longer term appears to be pulling back too; the measure grew 2.5% on the year, down from 13% in September 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Equipment investment growth slowed further in the fourth quarter, and we expect it to remain weak for most of this year," said Andrew Hunter , senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of previously owned homes fell in January, a sign that demand for housing continued to cool at the start of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales fell 1.2% in January from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.94 million, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. December sales were revised slightly higher, to a rate of 5.0 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected sales would rise 0.6% to a rate of 5.02 million in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">January marked the third consecutive month of declining sales, and last month's 4.94 million home sales were the lowest since November 2015. Compared with a year earlier, sales in January declined 8.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Lawrence Yun , the association's chief economist, said weak sales in January were likely to mark a cyclical low given moderating home prices and gains in household income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the January data indicated that the housing market started the first quarter on a weak footing. Last year was the weakest for home sales since 2015. Buyers pulled back in the latter half of 2018, as rising mortgage rates, high home prices, a volatile stock market, concerns that prices would start declining and anxiety about the national political situation all caused a number of buyers to hit pause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trump administration's 2017 tax law also reduced some incentives for homeownership, especially in costlier, high-density markets and high-tax areas, by reducing the cap for the deductibility of mortgage interest and limiting the amount of state and local taxes that can be deducted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of existing homes for sale rose 3.9% to 1.59 million in January. At 3.9 months' worth of supply, inventories were up slightly from 3.7 months in December, the realtors' group said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median sale price for a previously owned home last month was $247,500, up 2.8% from a year earlier, marking the 83rd straight month of year-over-year gains. Still, the 2.8% rise was the slowest year-over-year increase since February 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some housing-sector data were delayed recently due to the partial government shutdown. The Commerce Department's report on housing starts in December will be released Feb. 26, more than a month later than previously scheduled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of U.S. home-builder confidence increased in February for the second consecutive month. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> on Tuesday said its index of builder confidence in the market for new single-family homes rose to 62 in February from 58 in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strong job market and wage growth bode well for the housing market, while low inventory and high prices complicate the outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates were on the rise for most of 2018, but cooled at the turn of the year. The average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 4.37% the week ended Feb. 14, down from 4.94% in mid-November, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> .</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday: Minutes from the Fed's January policy meeting should provide new clues into how officials judged risks to the economy when they decided to remove language from their policy statement that had previously shown a bias toward raising rates. The written account of the meeting could also illustrate how officials are approaching plans to complete the runoff of their $4 trillion portfolio of bonds and other assets that they initiated in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday: The Commerce Department releases December durable-goods data. In November, demand for long-lasting goods [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-durable-goods-orders-grew-in-november-11545399250] produced by U.S. factories rose because of ramped-up aircraft orders. Meanwhile, an underlying business-investment gauge, new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, fell 0.6% from October. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast durable-goods orders rose 1.5% in December.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax-code overhaul that partially wiped out decades-old perks designed to encourage homeownership is slowly beginning to reshape the housing market and give an extra push to those considering fleeing high-tax states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By almost doubling the standard deductions for individual and joint tax filers, the law blunts the advantage of the mortgage-interest deduction. The overhaul also capped the deduction for state and local taxes at $10,000, a blow to homeowners in high-tax states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Read full coverage[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/news/collection/wsj-tax-guide-2019-83be16c8] and download the e-book: "The New World of Taxes: 2019"[https://www.wsjplus.com/offers/tax-guide-2019].]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taken together, the changes diminish significantly the perks of homeownership built into the tax code. ZIP Codes for areas that rely most heavily on the state and local tax deduction saw home values grow nearly a percentage point more slowly in December than ZIP Codes that rely least on the deduction, according to data from Zillow provided to The Wall Street Journal. That is a shift from November 2017, before the tax overhaul passed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the changes, U.S. home prices are still growing. But they are expected to be about 4% lower in the summer of 2019 than if there had been no change to the tax code, according to Moody's Analytics. In pricier markets in states like New Jersey, New York, Illinois and Pennsylvania, prices could be as much as 10% lower than they otherwise might have been, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By David Harrison </div><div>401 words</div><div>13 February 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans are borrowing more for cars and less for houses, according to a report released Tuesday by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage originations fell in the fourth quarter of 2018 to $401.5 billion from $445.3 billion in the previous quarter, the lowest level since the first quarter of 2016 in nominal terms. Mortgage originations for all of 2018 were at the lowest level since 2014. Auto loans, on the other hand, have been steadily moving up since 2010. Last year saw the highest volume in new auto loans on record, at $584 billion, according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift could be due to the sagging housing market, which slumped last year after several years of strong sales and rising prices. Now, with higher rates and steep prices deterring buyers, home sales are poised to soften still in 2019. Auto sales, meanwhile, rose rapidly following the recession and have remained strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year's growth in auto lending was primarily driven by borrowers with good credit scores, the <span class="companylink">New York Fed</span> said. As of the fourth quarter, people with credit scores above 760 originated about 30% of outstanding auto loans while subprime borrowers were responsible for 22% of all auto-loan balances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, U.S. household debt rose by $32 billion to $13.54 trillion in the fourth quarter, the 18th consecutive increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the higher debt loads, Americans appear to be keeping up with their payments. The report found that 95.4% of balances were current, a level that is roughly on par with prerecession levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage delinquencies have fallen since the financial crisis. In the fourth quarter only 1.06% of mortgage balances were overdue by 90 days or more, down from 8.89% in the first quarter of 2010. Auto-loan delinquencies also remain below their recession-era peak but have been slowly creeping up since 2014. About 4.47% of auto-loan balances were delinquent in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But auto delinquencies have been rising for lower-credit households. More than 8% of borrowers with credit scores below 620 became delinquent in the fourth quarter, at annualized rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">New York Fed</span>'s quarterly report on household debt and credit is based on data from the credit-ratings firm <span class="companylink">Equifax</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">School Endowments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth in college endowments slowed to 8% last year, due largely to a weaker stock market. In 2017, growth clocked in at 12%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown places more stress on colleges and universities, many of which are struggling to fill their classes. Over the longer term, schools have been pulling money from endowments faster than those endowments have been growing, when adjusted for inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the concerns are tax-law changes that mean many Americans are no longer able to deduct charitable donations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report released Thursday by the <span class="companylink">National Association of College and University Business Officers</span> and TIAA found that the 802 schools that reported results averaged one-year net returns of 8.2% in the fiscal year that ended June 30, compared with 12.2% in 2017.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of newly built homes soared in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales rose 16.9% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 657,000, the Commerce Department said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected new-home sales to reach an annual rate of 571,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report on November home sales had been postponed because of the partial shutdown of the federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new-home sales figure is a rough estimate that comes with a big margin of error. The figure is often revised later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the November increase, sales of new homes were down 7.7% compared to a year earlier, suggesting a bumpy housing market over the broader term. Higher mortgage rates and a runup in prices have dented home purchases over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage rose about 1 percentage point to nearly 5% from the start of 2018 to last November, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> .

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newly built homes are a slice of the overall housing market. Previously owned homes, known as existing homes, are the bulk of the market.

<span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> -bond prices climbed Tuesday as traders reacted to weaker-than-expected economic data and declines in technology stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on the benchmark 10-year <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> note settled at 2.712%, compared with 2.744% Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yields, which fall when bond prices rise, declined after new data showed home-price growth continued to slow in November, the latest evidence of a slumping housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller 20-city index grew by 4.7% from a year earlier -- down from 5.0% the previous month and below the 4.8% forecast by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yields also slipped after the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said its index of U.S. consumer confidence fell to 120.2 in January from 126.6 in December. Economists surveyed by the Journal had expected a 124.0 reading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soft economic data typically bolster Treasurys because slow economic growth usually constrains inflation, which threatens bonds by eroding the purchasing power of their fixed payments. Treasurys also benefited from a drop in technology shares that caused investors to shift money to safer assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in yields came one day before the conclusion of the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> 's two-day policy meeting. While the Fed isn't expected to change the level of short-term interest rates, investors will be looking for signals about the path of rates and changes in the central bank's bond portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following a Wall Street Journal report on Friday, many investors expect Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to confirm the central bank is nearing the end of its campaign to shrink its holdings of Treasurys, said Gary Pollack, head of fixed-income trading at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span> 's private-wealth-management unit.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth continued to ease off the accelerator in November, bolstering economists' predictions that price growth could slow to be more in line with increases in incomes and inflation this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 5.2% in the year ending in November, down from a 5.3% increase reported in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price growth slowed considerably in the final months of last year compared to the beginning of the year when prices were growing more than 6%. Many economists expect it to slow even further this year, with price growing in line with inflation at around 2% or 3%. That could be welcome news for buyer who have been struggling with affordability as mortgage rates rose late last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The pace of price increases are being dampened by declining sales of existing homes and weaker affordability," said David Blitzer , managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller 10-city index gained 4.3% over the year, down from 4.7% the prior month. The 20-city index dipped below 5%, gaining 4.7% compared to a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected the 20-city index to grow 4.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas had the fastest home price growth in the country for the sixth straight month at 12%, followed by Phoenix, where prices grew 8.1%. Seattle returned to the top three after falling out last month, but still prices there grew just 6.3%— about half where growth was a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a third of the 20 cities reported greater annual increases in October than November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth combined with rising mortgage rates has slowed sales in recent months. Existing home sales posted their largest annual decline in seven years in November and fell to their lowest level in more than three years in December.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of home builders battered during 2018 have soared so far this year, an optimistic sign for the U.S. economy amid fresh worries over a stagnant housing market and slowing global growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although housing data remain decidedly mixed, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> ' housing-market index showed home-builder confidence rebounded this month. It was helped by a gradual decline in mortgage rates, along with strong employment growth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower interest rates are giving would-be home buyers more of a reason to go ahead and get that house. Everything else is giving them less of a reason to pull the trigger, though.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes were unexpectedly weak last month. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported that an annualized 4.99 million homes were sold in December, down 6.4% from November, marking the lowest sales and sharpest drop in over three years. Economists had expected a 1.3% decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a bounce can't be ruled out, the housing recovery's best days probably are behind it. The decline in sales came despite an improved interest-rate backdrop. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 4.55% at the end of December, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> , after spiking to 4.94% in early November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some forecasters evidently thought the decline in rates would help bolster home sales, it is important to remember that lower rates didn't appear out of the blue. Rather, the rate decline reflected rising worries about the strength of the U.S. economy and an associated drop in the stock market. Those kinds of things make a lot of people think twice before a major purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also is important to note that existing-home sales are based on closings, so almost everybody who bought a home in December went looking for it, and into contract, earlier in the fall -- when mortgage rates were higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, a January bounce may not happen. There are about 800,000 federal employees who are either furloughed or working without pay as a result of the government shutdown. Buying a home can't be top of mind for many of them. Ditto for government contractors who have had their finances pinched.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More significantly for the housing market's future are other factors: Persistent price increases have put homes out of reach for many people, while changes in the tax law have reduced the advantages of Homeownership over renting. The share of households who believe it is a good time to buy a house has fallen to the lowest level since 2008, according to the <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span> 's survey of consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean the end is nigh. Assuming the shutdown gets resolved within the next few weeks and assuming the economy manages to weather through it, the drop in rates should start to matter more, and home sales should respond. That would be a relief, but it probably won't herald a new dawn.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto and Sarah Chaney </div><div>981 words</div><div>23 January 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales tumbled in December to their weakest level since 2015, ending a difficult year at a new low and offering fresh evidence that the housing market could be in for a bumpy ride in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the same forces that pounded global financial markets in the fourth quarter caused home buyers to pull back at the end of the year. Home sales were weighed down by a surge in stock-market volatility, uncertainty as the government shutdown began and rising interest rates, which pushed up mortgage rates in November to their highest level in seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing also suffered from high home prices and a dearth of starter homes in major markets, a nagging problem for much of last year that shows little sign of abating. A growing U.S. economy and low unemployment haven't kept home sales from sputtering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're in a mental recession," said Sam Khater , chief economist at Freddie Mac. "It's a constant stream of negative headlines for a couple of months . . . it wears on you."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December capped the weakest year for home sales in three years. Existing-home sales fell 6.4% in December from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.99 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Tuesday. Compared with a year earlier, sales in December declined 10.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak U.S. home sales -- along with overseas concerns after the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> cut its forecast for global growth and new data showed China's economy growing at its slowest annual pace since 1990 -- unnerved investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.2% to 24404.48 on Tuesday, while the tech-heavy <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> closed down 1.9% to 7020.36, ending stocks' four-day winning streak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, home-price growth has also slowed significantly, a sign that many owners struggling to sell their homes are starting to cut prices or ask for a more conservative number. The median sale price for an existing home in December grew 2.9% from a year earlier -- the smallest increase since March 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That slump could be good news for buyers, many of whom can't afford higher prices or worry about another housing bubble, and it could inject some positive momentum into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates have also come down in recent weeks, easing concerns that a long era of cheap housing credit was about to end. Rates nearly hit 5% about two months ago, but average rates for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 4.45% last week, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> . Purchase mortgage applications grew 9% for the week ending Jan. 11 from a week earlier to the highest level since April 2010, according to a <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> index. If rates stay low and stocks rally, that could help boost sentiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet December's numbers were worse than most economists' predictions, after November home sales seemed to suggest the market could be stabilizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December's drop "is much more precipitous than we thought," said Cheryl Young, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> , a housing-data firm. She said the data help confirm the "housing market's postrecession zenith has come and gone."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government shutdown could also damp some of the mortgage-rate-driven momentum. A survey by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> found that economic uncertainty caused by the shutdown is causing buyers to delay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Ehrenberg, a Redfin agent in Washington, D.C., has seen this pause. A federal government employee he knows had planned to search for a home to beat the spring rush but has put off getting preapproved for a mortgage or seriously looking because he hasn't been receiving a paycheck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in December sales was broad, with Seattle, Portland, much of California, Denver, Maryland, Delaware and the Philadelphia area experiencing double-digit declines, according to an analysis of local multiple-listing service data by Lawler Economic and Housing Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lindsay Cunningham and Ryan Brim bought a new townhouse in Philadelphia's trendy Fishtown neighborhood in early December for about $40,000 below the initial asking price and got an additional $10,000 seller concession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple, who are in their late 20s, had started looking in the spring and already had seen rates climb from about 4% to more than 4.5% -- or an increase in their monthly payment of about $120. That forced them to stretch a bit financially. But Mr. Brim, who works as a mortgage broker, was worried about waiting because he thought rates would keep going up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple's Realtor, Ashley Lauren Farnschlader, said many of her clients were holding off on buying. In the first weeks of this year, she said buyers have seemed more enthusiastic as mortgage rates eased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think this is a needed correction and it opens up a lot of hope and opportunities for first-time buyers," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown in December appears to have extended to the new-home market as well. The Commerce Department isn't expected to release December's data due to the shutdown, but an analysis by Redfin found that new-home sales dropped 10.3% in the South in December, 13.4% in the West and more than 16% in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has proved more sensitive to mortgage-rate increases than in previous cycles, in part because prices have been rising much faster than incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"<span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> officials were already on the lookout for signs that interest-rate-sensitive sectors of the economy were coming under stress, and right now home sales are the smoking gun that the Fed's rate hikes are starting to bite and slow the broader economy down," said Chris Rupkey , chief financial economist at MUFG.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto and Sarah Chaney </div><div>1110 words</div><div>22 January 2019</div><div>16:24</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales tumbled in December to their weakest level since 2015, ending a difficult year at a new low and offering fresh evidence that the housing market could be in for a bumpy ride in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the same forces that pounded global financial markets in the fourth quarter caused home buyers to pull back at the end of the year. Home sales were weighed down by a surge in stock-market volatility, uncertainty as the government shutdown began and rising interest rates, which pushed up mortgage rates in November to their highest level in seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing also suffered from high home prices and a dearth of starter homes in major markets, a nagging problem for much of last year that shows little sign of abating. A growing U.S. economy and low unemployment haven't kept home sales from sputtering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're in a mental recession," said Sam Khater , chief economist at Freddie Mac. "It's a constant stream of negative headlines for a couple of months…it wears on you."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December capped the weakest year for home sales in three years. Existing-home sales fell 6.4% in December from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.99 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Tuesday. Compared with a year earlier, sales in December declined 10.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak U.S. home sales—along with overseas concerns after the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> cut its forecast for global growth and new data showed China's economy growing at its slowest annual pace since 1990—unnerved stock-market investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.2% to 24404.48 on Tuesday, while the tech-heavy <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> closed down 1.9% to 7020.36, ending stocks' four-day winning streak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, home-price growth has also slowed significantly, a sign that many owners struggling to sell their homes are starting to cut prices or ask for a more conservative number. The median sale price for an existing home in December grew 2.9% from a year earlier—the smallest increase since March 2012, when the market was still depressed from the housing crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That slump could be good news for buyers, many of whom can't afford higher prices or worry about another housing bubble, and it could inject some positive momentum into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates have also come down in recent weeks [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/falling-mortgage-rates-raise-hopes-for-battered-housing-market-11546862400], easing concerns that a long era of cheap housing credit was about to end. Rates nearly hit 5% about two months ago [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/mortgage-rates-fast-approaching-5-a-fresh-blow-to-housing-market-1539266400], but average rates for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 4.45% last week, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> . Purchase mortgage applications grew 9% for the week ending Jan. 11 from a week earlier to the highest level since April 2010, according to a <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> index. If rates stay low and stocks rally again, that could also help boost sentiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet December's numbers were worse than most economists' predictions, after November home sales seemed to suggest the market could be stabilizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December's drop "is much more precipitous than we thought," said Cheryl Young, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> , a housing-data firm. She said the data help confirm the "housing market's postrecession zenith has come and gone."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government shutdown could also damp some of the mortgage-rate-driven momentum. A survey by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> found that economic uncertainty caused by the shutdown is causing buyers to delay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Ehrenberg, a Redfin agent in Washington, D.C., has seen this pause. A federal government employee he knows had planned to search for a home to beat the spring rush but has put off getting preapproved for a mortgage or seriously looking because he hasn't been receiving a paycheck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Buyers are asking about it a lot," Mr. Ehrenberg said of the shutdown. "It's just not something that folks are used to going on this long with no end in sight."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in December sales was broad, with Seattle, Portland, much of California, Denver, Maryland, Delaware and the Philadelphia area experiencing double-digit declines, according to an analysis of local multiple-listing service data by Lawler Economic and Housing Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lindsay Cunningham and Ryan Brim bought a new townhouse in Philadelphia's trendy Fishtown neighborhood in early December for about $40,000 below the initial asking price and got an additional $10,000 seller concession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple, who are in their late 20s, had started looking in the spring and already had seen rates climb from about 4% to more than 4.5%—or an increase in their monthly payment of about $120. That forced them to stretch a bit financially. But Mr. Brim, who works as a mortgage broker, was worried about waiting because he thought rates would keep going up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I thought we can afford this, even if we might be stretched thin," Mr. Brim said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple's Realtor, Ashley Lauren Farnschlader, said Ms. Cunningham and Mr. Brim were an exception last fall and many of her clients were holding off on buying. In the first couple of weeks of this year, she said buyers have seemed more enthusiastic as mortgage rates eased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think this is a needed correction and it opens up a lot of hope and opportunities for first-time buyers," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown in December appears to have extended to the new-home market as well. The Commerce Department isn't expected to release December's data due to the government shutdown, but an analysis by Redfin found that new-home sales dropped 10.3% in the South in December, 13.4% in the West and more than 16% in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has proved more sensitive to mortgage-rate increases than in previous cycles, in part because prices have been rising much faster than incomes. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has indicated that the central bank will be patient and flexible in raising interest rates [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-chairman-to-answer-questions-on-economy-and-rate-increases-11547116200]this year amid global economic turmoil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"<span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> officials were already on the lookout for signs that interest-rate-sensitive sectors of the economy were coming under stress, and right now home sales are the smoking gun that the Fed's rate hikes are starting to bite and slow the broader economy down," said Chris Rupkey , chief financial economist at MUFG.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Justin Lahart </div><div>456 words</div><div>22 January 2019</div><div>12:44</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower interest rates are giving would-be home buyers more of a reason to go ahead and get that house. Everything else is giving them less of a reason to pull the trigger, though.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes were unexpectedly weak [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-posted-steep-fall-in-december-11548169461]last month. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported that an annualized 4.99 million homes were sold in December, down 6.4% from November, marking the lowest sales and sharpest drop in over three years. Economists had expected a 1.3% decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a bounce can't be ruled out, the housing recovery's best days probably are behind it. The decline in sales came despite an improved interest-rate backdrop. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 4.55% at the end of December, according to Freddie Mac [http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/], after spiking to 4.94% in early November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some forecasters evidently thought the decline in rates would help bolster home sales, it is important to remember that lower rates didn't appear out of the blue. Rather, the rate decline reflected rising worries about the strength of the U.S. economy and an associated drop in the stock market. Those kinds of things make a lot of people think twice before a major purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also is important to note that existing-home sales are based on closings, so almost everybody who bought a home in December went looking for it, and into contract, earlier in the fall—when mortgage rates were higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, a January bounce may not happen. There are about 800,000 federal employees who are either furloughed or working without pay as a result of the government shutdown. Buying a home can't be top of mind for many of them. Ditto for government contractors [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/shutdown-is-a-hellacious-situation-for-federal-government-contractors-11547634603] who have had their finances pinched.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More significantly for the housing market's future are other factors: Persistent price increases have put homes out of reach for many people, while changes in the tax law have reduced the advantages of Homeownership over renting. The share of households who believe it is a good time to buy a house has fallen to the lowest level since 2008, according to the <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span> 's survey of consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean the end is nigh. Assuming the shutdown gets resolved within the next few weeks and assuming the economy manages to weather through it, the drop in rates should start to matter more, and home sales should respond. That would be a relief, but it probably won't herald a new dawn.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans' expectations that their homes will increase in value continues to ebb away, according to a new central bank survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</span> said Monday in its December Survey of Consumer Expectations that respondents' now only see a 3% rise coming for home prices. The bank said that's the sixth straight month of declining expectations for this key measure. Expectations of home price rises stood at 3.9% of June 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The public's reduced expectation for house price increases arrived in an environment where households' overall inflation expectations were mostly steady. The survey found that in December, survey respondents' expectations of inflation a year from now was steady at 3%, while the projection for inflation three years from now ticked up marginally to 3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey also found that while the public doesn't expect much change in prices for food, medical care or rent, they do anticipate declines in gasoline prices. The survey found a big drop for expectations of gasoline prices a year from now, with them now at a predicted 3.7% decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly <span class="companylink">New York Fed</span> survey comes as the housing environment faces increasingly tough times and inflation remains fairly stable, but still a bit lower than where Fed officials would like it to be. Housing has been under pressure from different sources, but central bank rate rises have increased the cost of home borrowing, and that's been a factor affecting the outlook for house prices.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates fell again in the latest week, hitting their lowest point in the past nine months for both 15- and 30-year products, a move that could propel more activity in the U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage declined to 4.45% for the week ended Thursday, compared with 4.51% a week earlier, according to mortgage-finance company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> .

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some predicted the most recent move would prompt more consumers to buy or refinance.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The funk in the housing market could be an important signal about the U.S. economy's sensitivity to rising interest rates. So could any rebound now that rates have retreated somewhat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year wasn't a good one for housing [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-u-s-housing-boom-is-coming-to-an-end-starting-in-dallas-1543248073]. Through October (the most recent data available, thanks to the government shutdown), sales of new single-family homes were down 12% from a year earlier. Sales of previously owned homes were down by 7% [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-rose-in-november-from-october-but-fell-from-a-year-ago-11545231917] through November. New-home construction slowed, home-price gains moderated and sentiment among home builders' slipped to a three-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One important culprit appears to be higher borrowing costs driven by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> 's interest-rate increases. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage climbed to as much as 4.9% in November, its highest level since 2011, versus 4% at the start of the year. For a $500,000 mortgage, that boosted the monthly payment by $266 to $2,654. The mortgage rate has since fallen to 4.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the market reaction was somewhat surprising. Today's rate is still low by historical standards and most home buyers, benefiting from a strong jobs market, should be able to shoulder the increased burden. But since rates were as low at 3.4% as recently at 2016, some homeowners have a strong incentive to stay put, much as they might want to move. This suggests that housing may have grown dependent on the low-rate environment that has prevailed since the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other factors affecting the housing market such as last year's tax bill, which limited deductibility for mortgage interest and state and local taxes. And since most home buyers focus more on monthly payments than the price of the house, home sales will slow further or prices will fall until payments even out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the bigger concern is that the whole economy has become dependent on low rates and that housing is just the first area to show it. Auto sales, which were bolstered by years of easy financing, have leveled off. The biggest risk could be for corporations, which saw big debt buildups during the last decade. Rising rates—and the lower tax-deductibility businesses get from borrowing—threaten to not only make companies more cautious about debt-financed investments or acquisitions, as they have with consumers, but may also make it hard for some heavily indebted companies to fund operations and or even stay afloat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed is worried enough about the economy's rate sensitivity [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/smaller-fed-moves-have-bigger-market-impacts-11545134401] that it expects to slow its tightening campaign. At the same time, though, policy makers have to be concerned that continuing to feed the economy's low-rate addiction could endanger its health. Housing may just have been the start. This year could exhibit more withdrawal symptoms.</p>

That rate is still higher than its level of 3.95% from a year ago but has fallen from a more-than-seven-year high of nearly 5% last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline stands to give consumers another shot at obtaining low rates on loans to purchase or refinance their homes, if they can stomach volatile financial markets and still lofty home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think there is latent demand on the sidelines given where rates are today," said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist. "The problem is that volatility is the obstacle."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising rates choked off a boom in refinancings and damped the purchase market for much of 2018, slowing the pace of home-price growth. The rate on a standard 30-year mortgage tends to closely follow the 10-year Treasury yield, which also hit a seven-year high of 3.23% last fall. On Friday, it finished at 2.66%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stock-market swings, high home prices and a traditionally slow time of year for home buying have largely kept a lid on housing-market activity in recent months. Mortgage applications slid 9.8% in the week ended Dec. 28 from two weeks earlier, according to a survey released last week by the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>. The shutdown of the federal government also factored into the drop, according the group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet as rates have steadily fallen, some agents said they have seen buyers start to creep back into the market. Tami Pardee, founder of Los Angeles-based Halton Pardee &amp; Partners, said her firm had seven homes go into escrow in the week before Christmas -- typically a dead time of year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said sellers have lowered their expectations about prices and buyers are anxious that rates will rise further, both of which have contributed to a pickup in sales. "I think people are worried that rates are going to go really high," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Benjamin, president of Two River Mortgage in Red Bank, N.J., said that one couple he worked with last week had been tentatively looking at homes a month ago. Now, after learning how much in savings they could get with lower rates, they are out looking more actively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Hopefully as the news gets out that mortgage rates have fallen, it will get those on the fence to accelerate their looking," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes rose 1.9% in November from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.32 million, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, though the figure is down sharply from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Refinancings also could pick up if mortgage rates keep falling, analysts said. If the standard 30-year rate drops by another 0.2 percentage point, borrowers of about $300 billion worth of loans backed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> would find it beneficial to refinance because they would save at least 0.5 percentage point on their rate, according to FTN Financial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those loans make up about 7.5% of outstanding loans backed by Fannie and Freddie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're right on the cusp of a significant refi event," said Walter Schmidt, manager of mortgage strategies at FTN Financial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Santhosh Kumar, a software engineer, bought a home in the San Francisco Bay Area about six months ago. He took out an adjustable-rate mortgage at a fixed rate of 3.5% for the first seven years and a floating rate after that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday, he was approached by his mortgage lender about refinancing. He plans to use the drop in rates to refinance into a 30-year fixed-rate loan at 3.75%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm worried what will happen in the next seven years and where rates will be," he said. "I'm thinking I'll have peace of mind for the next few years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the rise in rates over the past year has taken many potential buyers out of the market for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Severns, an agent for real-estate brokerage Redfin in Philadelphia, said he has tried calling buyers who withdrew from the market in the fall when rates rose. But many already have signed new yearlong leases or decided to invest in their current homes. Others are just wary of rates rising again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're afraid that they're going to get invested again in the process and then get let down," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Severns said he still expects 2019 to be one of the coolest housing markets in recent memory due to higher rates and a lack of inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lindsey Gudger, a real-estate agent in Seattle, which has experienced one of the country's sharpest drops in buyer demand in recent months, said many clients are using stock in locally based tech companies like <span class="companylink">Amazon.com Inc</span>. to help them come up with down-payment money to buy a home, so recent market declines have had an outsize impact on their appetite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> employees that say, 'I feel 25% to 30% poorer than I did six months ago. I'm going to pause this'" home search, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P 500 fell 12% in the last three months of 2018 and has marked large swings in the first three trading days of this year. That disproportionately affects wealthier buyers purchasing homes worth more than about $750,000, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s Mr. Khater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, mortgage rates are likely to have a more widespread effect on buyer behavior than swings in the stock market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you're a middle-class American, for the majority of Americans, they're not looking" at the stock market, said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices are sending first-time buyers to their parents for help with mortgage down payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 26% of mortgage borrowers who used <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> -insured loans got assistance from a relative to make the down payment in the 12 months through September, up from about 22% in 2011, according to data released late last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">FHA</span> , an arm of the <span class="companylink">Department of Housing and Urban Development</span> , insures lenders against losses on the sometimes riskier loans they make. Borrowers taking out <span class="companylink">FHA</span> loans are predominantly buying homes for the first time and often have weaker credit profiles that make it harder for them to get a conventional loan. It makes sense these borrowers might need to ask for help, but the <span class="companylink">FHA</span> is keeping an eye on whether the share doing so keeps rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While conventional mortgages can require buyers to put down as much as 20% of the purchase price upfront, <span class="companylink">FHA</span> buyers can pay as little as 3.5%. Such loans make up about a 10th of all U.S. home-loan originations, a share that has declined in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the pace of home-price growth has slowed, prices are still consistently rising year to year, and higher mortgage rates are making buying more expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has created a difficult situation for first-time buyers, many of whom are struggling to stockpile the cash for down payments. Factors including student debt and lackluster wage growth have made it difficult for many. The homeownership rate among those younger than 35 has fallen 8 percentage points since 2004 to 35% in 2017, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It suggests a great deal about the housing market, which is the ongoing affordability obstacles for first time borrowers," said Karen Petrou, managing partner at <span class="companylink">Federal Financial Analytics Inc</span> ., a policy-analysis firm based in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Belen and Frank Medina, both 26, closed last month on a light-brown house on a cul-de-sac in Dallas. They ended up relying on her parents to contribute a $4,000 gift toward the 3.5% down payment for their <span class="companylink">FHA</span> loan. Ms. Medina's parents indicated from the start that they would be willing to help them get the home they wanted, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were trying to get this on our own but we did come up short with money," she said, given that they are also making two car payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners who get help with their down payments have historically been viewed as riskier because they have sunk less money into their property and thus have less to lose by walking away if home prices drop or if they are laid off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, the credit quality of <span class="companylink">FHA</span> borrowers has declined. The average borrower had monthly debt that was equal to 43% of income in 2018, marking the sixth straight annual rise in that measure of creditworthiness, according to the <span class="companylink">FHA</span> report. The credit score of the average borrower declined to 670, the lowest level since 2008. Credit-reporting firm <span class="companylink">Experian PLC</span> considers scores under 670 subprime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the lead-up to the housing crisis, many home sellers provided down-payment assistance to <span class="companylink">FHA</span> borrowers to help close deals. They often routed such help through affiliated nonprofit programs that helped exacerbate the pain when the market crashed, some say. Such practices have since been prohibited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry executives say that assistance from a family member doesn't pose the same level of risk as getting help from a property seller. When the housing market falls, the thinking goes, borrowers feel more of an obligation to protect their relatives' equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think that family assistance has a higher moral bearing on people when things turn tough in the housing market," said Sanjiv Das, CEO of Caliber Home Loans Inc., the fifth-largest mortgage lender in the U.S. by loan volume, according to industry research group Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That bears out in the data the <span class="companylink">FHA</span> has tracked since 2011. Among <span class="companylink">FHA</span> loans issued in the 12 months ended in September 2011, 7.6% of those in which a family member helped with the down payment are now delinquent for 90 days or more. That's above the 5.2% rate for <span class="companylink">FHA</span> homeowners who didn't get assistance, but less than the 9.3% rate for those who got assistance from a party besides a relative or the government.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chef's kitchen of April and Anh-Tuan Truongs' new Chicago home, which they bought in September for $1.5 million, has a double-oven, gray custom cabinetry and quartzite waterfall countertops. PHOTO: Katrina Wittkamp for The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Want to know what it takes to sell a luxury home in a softening market? Ask Anh-Tuan and April Truong. In the fall, Dr. Truong, a cosmetic surgeon, and Ms. Truong, a stay-at-home mother to their two children, sold their 3,200-square-foot townhome in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood for $1.175 million after just 40 days on the market—while similar homes in the same condominium development languished for months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What gave the Truongs the edge? New quartzite countertops, new hardwood floors and a neutral, uncluttered décor—all part of a $30,000 upgrade in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sales have been slow over the last six months—you really have to stand out. Their place showed like a model unit," said Lauren Schuh-Dayton, the couple's real-estate agent and vice president of sales for Jameson Sotheby's International Realty. Within weeks of accepting the winning bid on their townhome, the Truongs bought an updated 1888 greystone house in Chicago's Lakeview East neighborhood for $1.5 million—$49,000 below the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the luxury market cooling, home sellers may have to invest in upgrades to get top dollar. According to an analysis by Realtor.com, high-end home sales rose 7% in October over the same month in 2017—the second-slowest increase in over two years. Meanwhile, the total number of properties listed at or above $1 million increased by over twice that rate—indicating that the supply of luxury homes may be outstripping demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Inventory starts to pile up because buyers don't see value at that price level," said Javier Vivas, Realtor.com's director of economic research. "Buyers are being more demanding." (<span class="companylink">News Corp</span> , owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> .)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To uncover the secrets of selling a luxury home in a softening market—and find out which amenities are attracting buyers—Mansion reached out to brokers, real-estate analysts, developers and designers. Here are their picks, in no particular order. One takeaway: A $10,000 Japanese toilet can clinch a sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retractable Glass Walls</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Light-filled," "bright," "southern" and "exposure" are among the most frequent keywords used to describe the luxury homes priced at $1 million and above that sold most quickly, according to a Realtor.com analysis of more than 45,000 luxury listings. For brokers and developers, all those words mean just one thing: glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When [clients] talk about 'bright' they are talking about big windows and sliding glass walls that open to the outside," said Billy Rose, founder and president of The Agency in Beverly Hills, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Preserve at Upper Saddle River, N.J., a new <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> community, retractable glass walls are luring buyers to single-family homes priced from $1.4 million. "People love the glass," said Jed Gibson, president of Toll Architecture, noting that over a third of new owners in its four upscale New Jersey developments opted for various movable glass-wall systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One thing I advise my clients to do if they can afford it, is to rip out french doors to an outdoor living space and put in accordion glass doors," said Collette McDonald, a Re/Max agent in Atlanta's Buckhead neighborhood. "They give traditional floorplans that contemporary, updated look."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High Ceilings</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Ten-foot ceilings, cathedral ceilings, vaulted ceilings" are all in demand, said Susie O. Johnson, a real-estate agent with <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker Gundaker</span> in metro St. Louis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Schumacher of custom home-builder Schumacher Homes said his clients willingly pay a premium for loftier master bedrooms and great rooms. "We always tell clients, 'Let's put the money and the investment in things you can't change later. I can change the finish on the floors, but I can't give you extra volume on ceilings,'" he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York's pricey condo market, 13-foot ceilings are now in vogue, according to John Gomes and Fredrik Eklund, who head a team at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span> . "The first thing buyers ask when they walk in—before they ask about square footage—is, 'How high are the ceilings?'" Mr. Gomes said. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quartzite Countertops</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quartzite, a lustrous natural stone that's harder than granite and less prone to staining than marble, is the new star of the chef's kitchen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Light whites and grays are replacing darker granites. Buyers like to see a light, neutral countertop, not something so personalized or so busy that it's competing with the tile on the backsplash," said Susan Boss, a broker-associate with Martha Turner Sotheby's International Realty in Houston who sells homes in the city's Rivercrest and Memorial neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Butler's Pantry</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A tricked-out butler's pantry with an extra wine fridge, icemaker or dishwasher can serve as an extension of the home's entertaining space—or hide the messy prep work. And according to Realtor.com's analysis, they are very popular with home buyers. "We looked at luxury properties with, say, a butler's pantry, and compared that to luxury properties without in the same area," said Mr. Vivas. "These homes are spending 40 to 60 fewer days on the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spa Bathrooms</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To hook a buyer willing to spend well over $1 million on a New York City condo, a master bathroom must have a steam shower and a high-tech Japanese toilet—"two things I will never ever live without," Mr. Eklund said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Francisco, the spa bathroom makeover has become standard in high-end remodels, according to designer Cindy Bayon. "Steam showers, heated floors—you assume that's in the project going in," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> has gone all-in with tubs. "It's a big trend for us. Our buyers told us they wanted free-standing tubs," Mr. Gibson said. In Houston, clients also show a preference for master bathrooms with dual toilets, said Ms. Boss. The status commode today, according to several agents: the Toto Neorest dual-flush model, which has a heated seat, multiple wash modes and an automatic air-purifying system. Retail price: $10,200.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smart-Home Systems</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">App-based home-automation systems that can play music, control lighting systems and window treatments, regulate thermostats and access security cameras are gaining in popularity. "It is now expected that a home has an ample amount of technology," said Gary Gold, executive vice president at Hilton &amp; Hyland,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four-Car Garage</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In areas where the cost of square-footage is high, a garage that can accommodate three or four cars is a prized amenity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Buyers love garages. That's really what turns a lot of guys on—their eyes light up," said Michael Costello, an associate with <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span> in Palm Beach, Fla. "Most of our buyers, even if it's just a couple, tend to have three, four, five, six cars."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the garage itself, people are looking for electric car hookups, as well as the ability to add a lift if they are a car collector," Ms. McDonald said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barn, Carriage House or In-Law Apartment</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barns aren't just for horses. Outbuildings that have been remodeled as party spaces, home offices or guest cottages lure buyers. "Having a barn on the property can be really valuable—whether it's used as a studio or as a guesthouse or cottage for family," said Sally Slater, an associate broker with <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> in Bedford, N.Y. "And you can get income from it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generator</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More buyers are asking about home generators, particularly in hurricane-prone areas. "It has become much more important than it was 10 years ago," said Ms. Boss, whose clients learned to love generators in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Adding a small generator for backup power to protect a valuable wine collection can cost as much as $50,000, she said, while larger systems for the home can cost $100,000 or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's one of those undervalued things, but use it once, and you're the happiest person," said Judy Gibbons, a broker associate with Jameson Sotheby's International Realty in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neutral Decor</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Light grays are really popular—whether it's flooring, or wall colors," Mr. Costello said. He advises clients ditch heavy drapes and put antique furnishings in storage. "Heavy brown furniture is out. It's not easy telling a client that buyers are turned off by that look."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And never underestimate a good coat of paint. Mr. Gold swears by a Dunn-Edwards hue called "Swiss Coffee." "When in doubt, white it out," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turn-offs to luxury-home buyers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents and designers say what's passe in home design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Granite</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Jetted bathtubs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. French doors with mullions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Unsightly built-in entertainment systems</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. Bidets</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. Heavy brown furniture</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, the credit quality of <span class="companylink">FHA</span> borrowers has declined [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/rising-home-prices-push-borrowers-deeper-into-debt-1523356200]. The average borrower had monthly debt that was equal to 43% of income in 2018, marking the sixth straight annual rise in that measure of creditworthiness, according to the <span class="companylink">FHA</span> report. The credit score of the average borrower declined to 670, the lowest level since 2008. Credit-reporting firm <span class="companylink">Experian PLC</span> considers scores under 670 subprime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the lead-up to the housing crisis, many home sellers provided down-payment assistance to <span class="companylink">FHA</span> borrowers to help close deals. They often routed such help through affiliated nonprofit programs that helped exacerbate the pain when the housing market crashed [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB121426681678998589], some say. Such practices have since been prohibited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry executives say that assistance from a family member doesn't pose the same level of risk as getting help from a property seller. When the housing market falls, the thinking goes, borrowers feel more of an obligation to protect their relatives' equity. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think that family assistance has a higher moral bearing on people when things turn tough in the housing market," said Sanjiv Das, CEO of Caliber Home Loans Inc., the fifth-largest mortgage lender in the U.S. by loan volume, according to industry research group Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That bears out in the data the <span class="companylink">FHA</span> has tracked since 2011. Among <span class="companylink">FHA</span> loans issued in the 12 months ended in September 2011, 7.6% of those in which a family member helped with the down payment are now delinquent for 90 days or more. That's above the 5.2% rate for <span class="companylink">FHA</span> homeowners who didn't get assistance, but less than the 9.3% rate for those who got assistance from a party besides a relative or the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 39% of <span class="companylink">FHA</span> borrowers get down-payment assistance, including from family, the government or another entity, a rise the agency says it is watching to see if it turns into a trouble spot. That is up from less than 30% in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saving for a down payment can be a challenge even for borrowers with good credit and steady income, and some companies are coming up with creative ways to help.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After slowing for several years, the Manhattan apartment market dropped to a new low in 2018, as co-op and condominium sales fell [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/new-condo-sales-plummet-1538931600?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=15] to the lowest level since the economy last bottomed out in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few brokers are predicting a recovery anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were down 12% from 2017 levels, a Wall Street Journal analysis found, and 22.5% from peak sales levels in 2013, the high point since the financial crisis that began in the fall of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home sales across the country have shown recent signs of slippage, they have been retreating for far longer in Manhattan, a bellwether for luxury markets, despite a strong local economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory in Manhattan has been rising for several years, and brokers said it was likely to rise further during the peak spring season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
steepest falloff [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/luxury-apartment-sales-plummet-in-new-york-city-1534770001?mod=article_inline] was in sales of new, expensive luxury condominiums, the analysis found, based on comparable sales that were filed with New York City by Dec. 24 of each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price trends were mixed. The median apartment price fell 5.2% in 2018, with condo prices down 6.5%, while co-op prices rose 2.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a Manhattan apartment was $1.09 million, while the average price was $1.96 million, following two years when the average topped $2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in apartment sales is likely to continue, following the recent stock market declines and rising volatility, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's rough," said Noah Rosenblatt, a real-estate broker who founded the real-estate data and listing site urbandigs.com. "We head into 2019, beaten, battered and now kicked by the recent stock market volatility."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an unusual shift for the typically optimistic real-estate industry, some brokers have been urging some buyers to wait if they can because prices may be lower next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Louise Phillips Forbes, a broker at Halstead Real Estate, said that she would advise first-time homeowners to lock in current interest rates and buy now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she said she is telling older retirees who are downsizing their homes to sell now and wait to buy. "It will be better to buy after prices go down to maximize retirement funds," she said. "Patience is your friend."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike 2009, when sales plummeted after the economy spun into recession, much of the decline in Manhattan happened during a period when the economy was growing both in New York and around the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through much of this period the stock market was rising. Usually it is an important predictor of real-estate trends because many affluent buyers work in finance, but the trends diverged during the past few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say that the Manhattan market was hit by a perfect storm of other problems, after several euphoric years when sales and asking prices rose rapidly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They cited weakening demand from foreign buyers amid a strong dollar and currency restrictions in some countries, rising interest rates, worries about the impact of federal tax changes that make holding real estate more expensive, and continuing political uncertainty over the leadership and direction of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is definitely challenging to be an agent in this market," said Shaun Osher, founder of brokerage CORE Real Estate. Mr. Osher said many sellers are reluctant to lower asking prices, while buyers want to have their pick of property at any price. "The vultures are swarming," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist for brokerages Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead, said that "negotiability is expanding." But when brokers want to know when sales will come in again, he tells them: "when sellers cut their prices enough."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Manhattan slowdown began among the most expensive apartments but has more recently spread across the entire market, with sales of apartments for less than $1 million falling by 8.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment sales between $4 million and $10 million showed the steepest declines of 22.9% in 2018. Sales of apartments for $25 million or more rose slightly, as closings began at several very expensive condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the fourth quarter of 2018, 10 of 14 sales above $25 million [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/battle-of-the-penthouses-shows-theres-life-in-luxury-market-11544619600?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=1] were at two new luxury towers, 220 Central Park South and 520 Park Ave. near 60th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both were designed by Robert A.M. Stern. The two most expensive sales during the quarter, penthouses at 520 Park Ave., both went into contract in June of 2017. One sold for $73.8 million and the second for $62 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But overall during fourth quarter of 2018, new development sales fell by 24.6% compared with the same quarter in 2017, when the median price of a new condo fell by 27.2%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth remained steady in October, the latest sign that conditions are becoming more favorable for buyers and are likely to continue doing so in the months to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 5.5% in the year ended in October, unchanged from the increase reported in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price growth is set to end the calendar year on a more muted note than it began, with prices growing by more than 6%. The slowdown has unnerved sellers, as many have been forced to cut prices after putting their homes on the market still expecting the steep increases their neighbors had seen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But more moderate price growth is a relief for many first-time buyers, taking the edge off higher mortgage rates and potentially allowing wages to start to catch up with the steep price gains in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Slowing home price appreciation can be read by many as an ominous sign -- a kind of canary in the coal mine -- for a more general downturn to come," said Aaron Terrazas , a senior economist at Zillow. But, Mr. Terrazas added, for now it represents a return "to more balance between buyers and sellers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller 10-city index gained 4.7% over the year, down from 4.9% the prior month. The 20-city index gained 5%, down from 5.2% the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas had the fastest home-price growth in the country for the fifth straight month, at 12.8%. But even there price growth is slowing as the market cools. Las Vegas was followed by San Francisco, where prices grew 7.9% and Phoenix at 7.7%. Seattle, which until recently spent two years as the hottest market in the country, fell out of the top three as the market there cools sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than five years of rapidly rising prices, combined with higher mortgage rates are making homes increasingly unaffordable for buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are now 54% above the bottom six years ago, or 40% adjusting for inflation, according to Mr. Blitzer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth has slowed sales in recent months. Existing-home sales posted their largest annual decline in seven years in November, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The combination of higher mortgage rates and higher home prices rising faster than incomes and wages means fewer people can afford to buy a house," said David Blitzer , managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> raised short-term interest rates again last Wednesday, though it indicated it could slow the pace of rate increases next year, citing economic headwinds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That announcement has helped push down the yield on the benchmark 10-year <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> , to which long-term mortgage rates are closely tied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.62%, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said last Thursday, down from nearly 5% earlier this fall.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A graphic showing the inventory of single-family homes that appeared with a U.S. News article Dec. 24 about the housing market incorrectly aggregated the data as annual figures rather than showing monthly figures. A link to a correct version of the chart can be found at WSJ.com/Corrections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ January 18, 2019)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A long rally in the housing market stumbled in 2018 and looks poised to slow further, another headwind for a U.S. economic expansion already contending with choppy financial markets and trade tensions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent decline in home sales reflects a lack of inventory and rising costs, which have priced many buyers out of the more desirable markets. Home prices are now at highs and inventory levels in recent months have begun climbing back from their lowest level in three decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising mortgage rates, which nearly touched 5% late this year as they climbed to their highest level in more than seven years, are the latest blow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Suddenly the light turned off in the second half of the year, with sales tumbling down and inventory rising," said Lawrence Yun , chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other developments that weighed on the market are likely to persist, or even worsen, economists said. A record drop in foreign purchases hurt markets in Florida, California, Seattle and New York. Those buyers, who have been put off by higher prices and increasing global tensions, show little sign of coming back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax bill that passed in late December 2017 could also weigh on some of the same once-hot markets. The bill capped the deduction for state and local taxes at $10,000. Most homeowners won't fully realize the impact until they do their taxes, which could provide another negative jolt to pricey markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2018, the housing market slowed despite a strengthening economy, unemployment falling to near a 50-year low, and a stock market that until recently hovered near record highs. That divergence between housing and economic performance has persisted for much of this year, defying predictions that healthy economic growth would pull housing out of its slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, some economists worry about the opposite: That weakening home sales could become a drag on growth next year as other sectors of the economy also begin to weaken. Escalating trade tensions with China, rising interest rates and a December stock market rout have put the expansion on shakier footing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing contributes about 15% to 18% of gross domestic product. Consumer confidence and home-improvement spending, construction and mortgage lending tend to suffer when home sales slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Robert Dietz , chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said he expects 2019 single-family housing starts to grow less than 2%, down from about 4% this year and 8% in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, many economists say the housing market is likely to continue to ease gradually, rather than fall hard as it did a decade ago. Existing home sales posted their largest annual decline in seven years in November but climbed 1.9% from a month earlier. That suggests the market is stabilizing, albeit at a lower level than its heyday in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My best guess is the housing market really comes into a soft landing," said Ralph McLaughlin , deputy chief economist at CoreLogic Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, Mr. McLaughlin cautioned, that best-case scenario depends on whether buyers and sellers start to panic as the market continues to slow, especially given how fresh the memories of the 2008 crash are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more optimistic read is that if home-price growth slows, inventory continues to swell and mortgage rates stabilize, that could give the housing market a brief second wind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun said strong underlying demand, especially from millennials who were unable to buy homes when the market was frenzied, will help keep the market relatively flat next year. He expects home sales to decline 0.4%. He said home-price appreciation will likely slow to about 2.5%, down from about 5% this year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday: The <span class="companylink">U.S. Labor Department</span> releases unemployment benefit applications data from last week. These so-called jobless claims hit a 49-year low in mid-September before rising modestly, a development that was likely related to two hurricanes striking the southern U.S. Claims have since fallen, and could potentially hit another record low in the coming weeks. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect the data will show claims ticked up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department publishes figures for sales of new homes across the U.S. in November. Sales of new U.S. homes slid sharply in October as higher mortgage rates and rising construction costs created significant headwinds for home builders. Still, some analysts think that a shortage of existing homes on the market could push sales of new homes higher. Economists think new-home sales ramped up in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> releases consumer confidence data for December. The measure fell in November from an 18-year high, driven by weaker expectations for the economy. Still, this overall high confidence helped driven strong consumer spending. With other key parts of the U.S. economy sputtering, U.S. consumers will likely be the key driver of economic growth in 2019. Economists think consumer confidence fell in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday: The Commerce Department publishes November trade figures. Recent data have shown the trade deficit hitting a decade high, led in part by tax-cut-driven domestic demand and a potentially tariff-related fall in exports. The China-Trump administration trade standoff appears to be cooling after Beijing agreed to a few concessions, but tariffs on a host of Chinese products are set to rise next year if further negotiations don't prove fruitful.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major League Baseball and the players' union reached an agreement with Cuba's baseball federation to create a safe, legal path for players from the island nation to play professionally in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, Cuban players who wanted to pursue rich contracts in the U.S. had to endanger their lives to escape their homeland's Communist regime and establish residency in another country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the deal, the Cuban Baseball Federation must release any player who is at least 25 years old and has six or more years of professional service time in Cuba. The FCB can also choose to release younger players who are at least 18. Once released, the players will be considered free agents without leaving Cuba and will be eligible to sign with any major-league organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any MLB team that signs a released Cuban player will pay the FCB a fee of 15% to 20% of the total guaranteed value of a major-league contract, or 25% of the signing bonus of a minor-league contract.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned U.S. homes edged up in November from a month earlier but clocked the largest annual decline in more than seven years, signaling the sputtering housing market may finish the year on a soft note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's data showed some buyers might be re-entering in the market but that conditions are far from robust. Existing-home sales rose 1.9% in November from October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.32 million, the National Association of Realtors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheryl Young, senior economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> , said discouraged potential buyers who were on the sidelines for a while might have waded back into the market, responding to slower price growth and less competition in some areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some frustrated home buyers were finally ready to make a move," Ms. Young said. She said the bulk of the evidence points to a housing market that is tapping on the brakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in November decreased 7% from a year earlier, the largest year-to-year drop since a May 2011 decline that came after a surge of demand in the year-earlier period anticipating the end of a tax credit for first-time home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The western U.S. is enduring an especially precipitous housing slowdown, reflecting affordability challenges in markets including Seattle and San Francisco. Existing-home sales in the West declined 15.4% in November from a year earlier, and the median price grew just 1.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the West, "The buyers have disappeared; inventory is sitting on the market," said Lawrence Yun , chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. Prices there may soon start falling, he said, which could be a relief for buyers but could cause panic among sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year's sales slowdown has stemmed from growing challenges for the housing market. A shortage of homes for sale at a time when continued job and wage growth are supporting demand have contributed to a rapid run-up in home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While price growth has slowed in recent months, homes remain out of reach for many potential first-time buyers. This is partly because mortgage rates are rising and appear to be nearing 5%, a threshold analysts say could deter many from purchasing a home. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in November was 4.87%, up from 4.03% in January, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for an existing home in November was $257,700, up 4.2% from a year earlier. There was a 3.9-month supply of homes on the market at the end of November, based on the current sales pace. While that's up from 3.5 months in November 2017, inventory is coming back on the market for higher-priced homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is still a housing shortage for affordable homes that many moderate- to middle-income families will be looking for," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trump administration's tax bill also reduced some incentives for homeownership, especially in costly coastal markets and high-tax areas, by reducing the cap for the deductibility of mortgage interest and limiting the amount of state and local taxes that can be deducted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month's sharp annual drop may in part reflect a surge of sales activity in November 2017 as buyers anticipated the passage of the tax bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the broader housing market appears to be pulling back. In November, single-family construction, which has stagnated this year after steadily climbing throughout the expansion, dropped for the third consecutive month, according to the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say builders could be taking a cautious stance because of the overall temperature of the housing market. Home-builder sentiment in December fell to its lowest level since May 2015, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of previously owned homes account for the bulk of U.S. homebuying activity. The Commerce Department releases data on November new-home sales next Thursday.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts rose in November, reflecting a large climb in apartment building that masked weakness in single-family home construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts increased 3.2% in November from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.256 million, the Commerce Department said Tuesday [https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf]. Residential building permits, which can signal how much construction is in the pipeline, grew 5.0% from October to an annual pace of 1.328 million last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-starts data are volatile from month to month and can be subject to large revisions. November's 3.2% rise for starts carried a margin of error of 9.8 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broader trend shows starts rose by 5.1% in the first 11 months of 2018 compared with the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The November rise in housing starts stemmed from the multifamily sector, where demand in 2018 has been stronger than many forecasters anticipated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Danielle Hale, chief economist for realtor.com, said the strength in the multifamily sector points to factors preventing renters from becoming homeowners, such as rising prices and student loan burdens. Developers are likely building more rental properties as single-family demand faces headwinds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are a lot of factors hampering their ability to get into the housing market, but it hasn't deterred their desire to become homeowners," Ms. Hale said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts for buildings with two or more units clocked a 22.4% rise in November from the previous month, reflecting some payback after declining earlier this fall. Single-family construction, which has stagnated this year after steadily climbing throughout the expansion, dropped for the third consecutive month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weakness in construction of single-family homes underscores heightened affordability concerns among home builders, who face rising material and labor costs. On Monday, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> reported that home-builder confidence in December fell to its lowest level since May 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The November decline in home building was particularly acute in the pricey West market, where single-family starts posted the largest monthly drop since 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite strong economic growth and a historically low unemployment rate, factors that should support home-buyer demand, a shortage of inventory and rising borrowing costs have locked out many would-be buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Rising mortgage rates continue to be the most important factor in the drop in housing demand, as job growth, wage gains, and demographics are all positive," said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide, in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite a run-up in mortgage rates this year, a recent cooling could help some buyers enter the market. The rate for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell to 4.63% in the week ended Dec. 13, the lowest since mid-September, according to data released by <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But in most markets, we'll continue to see stalemate between buyers and sellers, with fewer transactions than we saw a year ago," Ms. Hale said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday: The <span class="companylink">U.S. Commerce Department</span> publishes third-quarter trade data. The current-account deficit, a measure of the nation's trade and financial flows with other countries, narrowed in the second quarter on ramped-up goods and services exports. The data will be highly watched as the Trump administration's trade spat with China continues. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect the trade gap widened in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">U.S. National Association of Realtors</span> releases its gauge on November sales of previously owned homes. Purchases of such homes posted their largest annual decline since 2014 in October as the housing market continues to sputter due to higher mortgage rates that are reducing home affordability. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect sales declined in November from the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">U.S. Federal Reserve</span> releases its statement and projections from its December meeting. Recent economic data releases, including a solid jobs report, likely keep the Fed on track to raise rates at the meeting. Fed officials believe the economy is on a strong footing but is likely to slow in the coming year, a transition they are monitoring closely. Analysts think the pace of rate increases could slow next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday: The <span class="companylink">U.S. Commerce Department</span> publishes its November figures on orders for long-lasting factory goods. Its most recently published report showed a decline in orders that suggested business investment is softening, a discouraging sign for economic growth in the fourth quarter. Economists surveyed by the Journal think orders picked up in November, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The department also releases November personal income, spending and inflation data on Friday. Its October report showed a fresh sign of weakening inflationary pressures, though price increases could accelerate if pressure from labor shortages and tariffs intensify or oil prices pick up after a recent slump. Economists surveyed by the Journal expect price growth picked up.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>775 words</div><div>14 December 2018</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national housing slowdown is spreading to markets like Las Vegas, where prices still haven't reclaimed their precrisis peaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After home values rose sharply this year, the market has shifted in recent weeks. Prices fell slightly in November while the inventory of unsold homes in the Las Vegas region has roughly doubled compared with a year earlier, according to the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors. Existing home sales slowed nearly 12% in November compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angela Hutchins, a Las Vegas real-estate agent, said price cuts of up to tens of thousands of dollars are now common. "Any property that we're pulling up right now, it is reduction, reduction, reduction," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of Las Vegas-area listings with price cuts rose to 23% in October from 11% a year earlier, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year's slowdown began in some of the hottest markets like Seattle and Denver, which rebounded early from the housing crash. Prices in these markets are still 30% to 70% above their previous peaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now these cities are looking less like an exception and more like leaders of a broader national slowdown that is spreading to less expensive markets -- Tampa, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Las Vegas -- that haven't fully recovered from the prior crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent weakness is driven less by lack of affordability, but rather by a sense of panic among buyers and sellers for whom the memory of the last crash is still fresh, real-estate brokers and housing analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas was "the poster child of the housing crash in 2008," said Vivek Sah, director of the LIED Institute for Real Estate Studies at the <span class="companylink">University of Nevada, Las Vegas</span> . "There are some buyers who are not pulling the trigger because of that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deceleration in these less expensive markets suggests that the housing slowdown isn't a temporary blip but could become a longer-term shift to a more sluggish national housing market in the months to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Las Vegas, where home prices fell the furthest of any major market in the country, the median home price remains about 7% below its previous peak of $315,000 more than a decade ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But prices were still rising up to October thanks to a surge in buyers priced out of California, new jobs from growing data centers, and the planned relocation of the <span class="companylink">Oakland Raiders</span> football team to Las Vegas in 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price shot up from $265,000 at the beginning of this year to $300,000 in September, according to the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors. In September -- the most recently available data -- Las Vegas was the only market in the country covered by the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index that saw double-digit price appreciation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks the market has shifted, and prices declined to roughly $295,000 in November. Still, the slowdown is a nascent trend in many of these areas, and the market could yet rebound during the busier spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Sah said buyers in the region are much more cautious than they were a decade ago, when many people bought multiple homes near the peak of the market. Now, after seeing prices shoot up, many sellers have rushed to put their homes on the market before prices came back down at the same time as buyers have put on the brakes, real-estate agents said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has also been warning that Las Vegas is one of the most overheated markets in the country based on a growing disconnect between prices and rents and incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Bishop, president of the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors, said he expects the number of homes for sale in the region to continue growing. He views this as a normalization of the market, rather than an echo of the prior crash. Currently there are about 7,000 homes on the market, whereas during the last crash inventory swelled to more than 20,000 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We saw the job market tanking and people buying brand-new houses. That doesn't even make sense," he said. "We don't see that anymore."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, there are few signs that homeowners are stretched too thin. The share of mortgages in the Las Vegas area that are 30 days or more delinquent was just 3.9% in September compared with nearly 25% at the bottom of the last housing crash, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span> .</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kent Ambler's Greenville studio is filled with his artwork as well as folk art from around the country. PHOTO: Danielle Paul for The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keith Grace, a mixed-media painter, and his wife, Shari, a graphic artist and stained-glass sculptor, came from Rockford, Ill. Renowned printmaker Kent Ambler and his wife, Peggy, came from Roswell, N.M. And Yuri Tsuzuki, a sculptor and painter, relocated from Bogota, Colombia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of these artists—and hundreds of others—have chosen to live in Greenville, S.C., a Southern city of about 68,000 people that once called itself the Textile Capital of the World. Today, the vibrant arts scene is revitalizing the city itself, attracting other artists, young professionals and families wanting a fun, affordable place to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We came looking for artists," says Mr. Ambler, who is 47. He and his wife wanted to live somewhere warm, but California was too expensive and they didn't think Florida was a good fit for his artwork. When a teaching job opened, they moved in 2000 to Seneca, S.C., about 30 miles west of Greenville, and bought a 1,800-square-foot studio for $88,000, selling it seven years later for $210,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October 2000, Mr. Ambler began showing his work in a Greenville gallery and started looking for homes nearby. He paid $410,000 for a 4,000-square-foot, four-bedroom, 4½-bath, ranch-style house on 12 acres in 2009 in a neighborhood called Paris Mountain that's about a five-minute drive from downtown. Built in the 1960s, it was structurally sound but needed slight renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He furnished it with pieces he made in his shop along with Midcentury Modern furniture found on <span class="companylink">eBay</span> and estate sales and blanketed walls and shelves with art made by friends. This past year Mr. Ambler finished building a new 1,600-square-foot art studio out of what was a garage, spending about $120,000 on it along with $30,000 for the construction of a koi pond and landscaping work. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ambler, a printmaker, has two presses in his studio. PHOTO: Danielle Paul for The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2014, artist Yuri Tsuzuki, who is 42, moved back to Greenville, where she had grown up. Her decision was based, in part, on how much the city had changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in the '70s, Greenville had become a rundown old mill town. Dozens of companies that once operated there closed down when textile manufacturing shifted overseas, leading to blight and high unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the 1980s, other types of manufacturing started to emerge. In 1988 French tire company Michelin relocated its North American headquarters there. In the 1990s, <span class="companylink">BMW</span> opened a factory in nearby Spartanburg, S.C., where it now makes 1,400 vehicles a day. Swiss-based <span class="companylink">ABB</span> and German-based Bosch also have operations nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The artsy vibe took root in 2005 with an annual, three-day festival called Artisphere, says Alan Ethridge , executive director of Greenville's Metropolitan Arts Council, which now has an annual budget of $2 million. An annual open studio that included 48 artists 10 years ago now has 144 artists. The three-year-old Greenville Center for Creative Arts, housed in an old textile mill, has raised almost $2 million and has more than 45 instructors now. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Artist Yuri Tsuzuki moved back to Greenville, where she had grown up, in 2014. PHOTO: Danielle Paul for The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign to make Greenville into a cool city—the next Portland, Ore.—began in 2012 and is centered around the catchphrase "Yeah, that," as in yes, the Greenville in South Carolina as opposed to some 36 other towns named Greenville across the United States. The city has a 32-acre park with the Reedy River and a waterfall in its center. The roughly 22-mile GHS Swamp Rabbit Trail—created from an abandoned railway bed—also cuts through downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tsuzuki bought her childhood home from her father for $200,000 15 years earlier, but had resisted living there full time, choosing instead to live in Bogota. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tsuzuki, a sculptor and painter, converted the garage into her studio. PHOTO: Danielle Paul for The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since moving to Greenville full time, her traditional neighborhood has seen families from all over the world move in. The changing landscape gave Ms. Tsuzuki the confidence to build a contemporary steel-and-glass studio and guesthouse on her property because she knew it wouldn't upset the neighbors. The $180,000 project included converting what was a garage, adding a second story and creating a work space. The yard of the 4,225-square-foot main house is dotted with her metal sculptures, many in primary colors, and one of her signature butterfly sculpture installations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What makes Greenville different is that many of the newly arrived artists are already established—not stereotypically young and starving. Because of that, the newcomers are buying high-end homes and building studios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keith and Shari Grace, both 57, had lived in Rockford their whole lives and raised their kids there. They discovered Greenville by participating in Artisphere. In 2016, they bought a 4,000-square-foot, five-bedroom, four-bath contemporary house for $417,000 and spent another $100,000 to fix it up, turning one large room into Mr. Grace's studio and one into a workroom for Ms. Grace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are Midwesterners," says Mr. Grace. "The South was never on our radar." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keith Grace, a mixed-media painter, in his studio at his Greenville house. PHOTO: Danielle Paul for The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The influx of artists has come hand-in-hand with rising home prices. Since 2015, the average price of a home sold year to date has grown 21%, while the number of homes priced $1 million and over has almost tripled during that time, according to the Greater Greenville Multiple Listing Service. "There's an extreme lack of inventory," says <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker</span> Caine real-estate agent Virginia Hayes. She says bidding wars have meant a $300,000 house might now be a fixer-upper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, Mr. and Ms. Grace are getting into the real-estate scene: Last December they bought a five-bedroom, four-bathroom, 4,200-square-foot house nearby for $300,000 and fixed it up, putting it back on the market, priced at $649,000. "Artists can flip houses, too," says Ms. Grace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bidding Wars of Greenville</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there's one thing Greenville real-estate agents agree on it's that a strong market has led to a severe lack of inventory. According to the Greenville Multiple Listing Service, 36% of all homes on the market are brand new or not yet built. Bidding wars are rampant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Agents are trying to keep listings in house in their own offices before others hear about them," says Lisa DeLuca Alexander, owner of Del-co Realty Group. And, she adds, "Buyers have to come in over asking" price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, prices are nowhere near the levels of cities like San Francisco and Boston. Currently on the market is a three-bedroom, three-bathroom, 2,395-square-foot Colonial with a wraparound deck on a quarter-acre, listed for $283,000. The most expensive house currently listed is a five-bedroom, nine-bathroom, 12,558-square-foot stone mansion. Built in 1998, the home sits on 6 acres and includes a pool. The asking price is $6.75 million. A 8,500-square-foot traditional home built in the 1920s is listed for $3.5 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are starting to offer more incentives for buyers, such as $5,000 to $10,000 of free upgrades. While prices have also risen by nearly 6% in Phoenix since the beginning of the year, Mr. Belfiore said the market remains affordable by historic standards. Prices are still more than 8% below their previous peak, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Belfiore attributes the slowdown more to the psychological impact of roughly a one-percentage-point increase in mortgage rates. "I think there's a little bit of a shock value," he said.</p>
