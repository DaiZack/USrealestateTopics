<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerns about the fiscal problems bedeviling Greece and Portugal sent European stocks and the euro lower Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fears that the problems along the euro-zone periphery won't be resolved anytime soon also pushed Treasurys higher initially as investors sought safety in bonds. However, Treasury prices surrendered their gains after the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee kept rates unchanged, as expected, but issued a more upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two-year Treasury note, the most sensitive to changes in the official rate outlook, fell 3/32 to settle at 99 30/32, to yield 0.915%. Bets on higher interest rates later this year rose after the Federal Open Market Committee statement, pushing the two-year yield to its highest level since Jan. 14.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benchmark 10-year bond fell 4/32 to 97 25/32 to yield 3.646%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FOMC removed a sentence from its statement that has been in place since April 2009. The statement that the economy is "likely to remain weak for a time," was changed to "the pace of economic recovery is likely to be moderate for some time." The statement also noted the U.S. economy has continued to "strengthen," which is more upbeat than the December statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news helped U.S. financial stocks stage a late rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 41.87 points, or 0.4%, at 10236.16, while the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500-stock index rose 0.5% to 1097.50 and the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 0.8% to 2221.41.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Europe, the pan-European Stoxx 600 Index closed down 0.8% at 247.31, with banks weighing heavily on the index. Regionally, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index closed 1.1% lower at 5217.47, while France's CAC-40 index was off 1.2% at 3759.80, its lowest close since Dec. 9. Germany's DAX was down 0.5% to finish at 5643.20.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Portuguese government reported a higher-than-expected budget deficit of 9.3% of gross domestic product in 2009 late Tuesday, and pledged to lower that to 8.3% of GDP in 2010. That figure remains well above the euro-zone deficit limit of 3% of GDP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Greece, where the deficit has soared to 12.7% of GDP, the cost to insure Greek sovereign debt against default hit a record high after the country denied reports of a planned bond sale to China. The country is planning a road show next month to woo Asian and American investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today's developments confirm that the euro-zone's fiscal problems will continue to flash red on the markets' radar screen," said Marco Annunziata, chief economist at <span class="companylink">UniCredit</span> Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., new home-sales data unexpectedly fell in December, with single-family home sales dropping to 7.6% from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 342,000, said the U.S. Commerce Department. The weak report underscored the fragility of the nascent economic recovery in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In currency markets, the euro was at $1.4020, from $1.4079 late Tuesday in New York, and sterling traded at $1.6167 from $1.6143. The dollar strengthened to 90.02 yen from 89.64 yen, while the euro slipped to 126.21 yen from 126.27 yen late Tuesday. The dollar was at 1.0498 Swiss francs from 1.0461 francs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In commodity markets, light, sweet crude for March delivery fell $1.04 a barrel, or 1.4%, to $73.67 on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span> amid signs of weak U.S. demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold futures settled lower in response to the stronger dollar and weaker equities, but traders also sold in order to square their positions ahead of the Fed statement and President Barack Obama's State of the Union address. The January contract fell 1.2% to $1,084.40 per troy ounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among stocks:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greek banks were under notable pressure, with Alpha Bank down 7.9%, weighing on the Greek ASE Composite Index, which fell 3.9% to 1972.93.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dutch sports-car maker <span class="companylink">Spyker Cars</span> soared 41% on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange. Spyker late Tuesday agreed to buy Swedish car maker Saab from General Motors.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for new homes in December fell, as cold weather and continuing joblessness put a chill on hopes for a housing-market recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home sales fell 7.6% from November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 342,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, though it noted the drop was within the margin of error. December's reported drop followed a 9.3% plunge in November. Meanwhile, on a positive note, home inventories fell last year, compared with 2008, but prices fell, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The new-home market continued to wilt late in 2009," Mike Larson, an analyst at Weiss Research Inc., wrote clients. "The buyers who are willing and able to buy are flocking to cheaper, distressed, 'used' homes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales for all of 2009 dropped sharply, by 22.9% to an unadjusted 374,000, from 2008's 485,000, as the industry struggled after collapsing from its multiyear boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales suffered because of strong demand for used homes and the looming expiration of a big tax credit. Fears that the $8,000 government incentive for first-time buyers would run out Nov. 30 pushed purchases into earlier months. Congress in early November extended the relief through April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Overall, the housing-market recovery remains fragile," <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>'s Anna Piretti wrote to clients. "Tight credit conditions, ongoing deleveraging, a likely increase in mortgage rates and a 10% unemployment rate all point to sluggish housing demand after the tax-credit program expires."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts believe a sustainable housing-market recovery in the spring will depend on improvements in the labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit was an early Obama administration tool to revive the moribund housing sector and to help jump-start an economy deep in recession. In recent months, it has caused swings in sales. Data Monday showed existing-home sales plunged in December after three straight increases, fueled by buyers taking advantage of the $8,000 subsidy and dirt-cheap prices on foreclosed homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weather is also a wild card for the housing market. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said December was three degrees below normal. And it was the 11th-wettest December on record. The weather drove buyers to the sidelines, and reduced construction, leading to a drop in housing starts. Permits for future construction, though, jumped, indicating builders haven't lost heart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have been buoyed by shrinking inventories. There were an estimated 231,000 homes for sale at the end of December, down from 235,000 in November. But the months' supply at the current sales rate rose because sales fell sharply, to 8.1 from 7.6 in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While bad weather, difficulty getting loans and the job market scared off some buyers last month, low prices and interest rates enticed others. The median price for a new home fell 3.6% in December to $221,300 from $229,600 in December 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, December new-home sales were mixed, rising 42.9% in the Northeast and 5.2% in the West, falling 41.1% in the Midwest and 7.3% in the South.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ATLANTA—The Congressional Oversight Panel is widening its inquiry into the souring commercial real-estate bank loan market as part of its review of a federal bailout program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the panel's questions: are banks failing to own up to property losses on a timely basis?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a hearing in Atlanta, the panel's chair, Harvard professor Elizabeth Warren asked whether loan workouts that give borrowers a reprieve are instead allowing banks to stave off recognizing losses. She also expressed concern that federal bank guidelines issued last fall are cutting banks too much of a break.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those guidelines don't force banks to recognize losses on commercial loans solely because collateral backing the loan has fallen in value. "I'm really troubled about this," Ms. Warren told representatives of the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. and Federal Reserve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concern about banks' exposure to commercial real estate has been rising as a growing number of loans have gone bad. In the latest example of a high-profile troubled borrower, Sea Island Co., a famous coastal Georgia resort facing debt it can't cover, said Wednesday it will hire an investment bank to advise the resort on options, which could include a sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sea Island also said that its lenders, including <span class="companylink">Columbus Bank and Trust</span>, a unit of Georgia-based <span class="companylink">Synovus Financial Corp</span>., had agreed to a forbearance agreement after Sea Island defaulted on an estimated $250 million in debt that had been restructured. The lenders also support the plan to hire an advisor for Sea Island. <span class="companylink">Synovus</span> said Sea Island's decision had been expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel, which monitors the Trouble Asset Relief Program, or TARP, is expected to publish a report on commercial real estate next month. It heard Wednesday from two bank regulators as well as commercial real-estate developers and lawyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We love our sparkling, tall, new buildings," <span class="companylink">Troutman Sanders</span> lawyer Mark Elliott said in prepared remarks. "There is an enormous amount of distress in the commercial loan markets in Atlanta; certainly more than I have witnessed in my 30 years of practice."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Olasov, a managing director at law firm McKenna Long Aldridge who spoke at the hearing, said banks are under competing contradictory pressures: maintain capital and yet recognize losses on impaired loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given capital constraints, banks frequently make decisions predominantly on the basis of preserving regulatory capital," Mr. Olasov said in an interview. "This sometimes has the perverse effect of banks making lending or investment decisions without strict regard to the economics of the given transaction. In the face of regulatory pressure, this makes sense."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doreen Eberley, acting Atlanta regional director for the FDIC, told Ms. Warren that the new bank guidelines weren't an example of regulators giving banks a pass. An FDIC spokesman in Washington, D.C., said financial regulators want to strike a balance in assessing bank risk-management practices for loan workouts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In her remarks, Ms. Eberley said the agency was monitoring bank loans for residential land developments. Those loans, called acquisition, development, and construction loans, have especially hurt Georgia banks. The problem, Ms. Eberley said, was the fact that increasing volumes of subprime loans were driving that development wasn't apparent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel is also investigating the way commercial loan losses, unemployment, and a lack of new loans are converging. The February report is likely to examine the extent of commercial real-estate losses at community and regional banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loan problems are "concentrated in the very banks that you need to restart the economy," Ms. Warren said in an interview.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Greece, Portugal Fears Weigh on European Markets</span>
</div><div class="author">By Ishaq Siddiqi   </div><div>816 words</div><div>27 January 2010</div><div>12:40</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European stock markets ended lower Wednesday amid rising concerns about the fiscal problems bedeviling Greece and Portugal. The euro slumped against the dollar while oil and gold prices were little changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors pushed German bunds and U.S. Treasurys higher, classic moves to safety, as fears mounted that the problems along the euro-zone periphery won't be resolved anytime soon. The Portuguese government reported a higher-than-expected budget deficit of 9.3% of gross domestic product in 2009 late Tuesday, and pledged to lower that to 8.3% of GDP in 2010. That figure remains well above the euro-zone deficit limit of 3% of GDP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Greece, where the deficit has soared to 12.7% of GDP, the cost to insure Greek sovereign debt against default hit a record high after the country denied reports of a planned bond sale to China. The country is planning a road show next month to woo Asian and American investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors Thursday will digest the results of the Federal Reserve's policy-making meeting, which adjourned after the European close, as well as President Obama's State of the Union address Wednesday evening in the U.S. Also for Thursday, Germany releases employment data and the U.S. reports weekly jobless figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the pan-European Stoxx 600 Index closed down 0.8% at 247.31, with banks weighing heavily on the index. Regionally, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index closed 1.1% lower at 5217.47, while France's CAC-40 index was off 1.2% at 3759.80. Germany's DAX was down 0.4% to finish at 5643.20. Asian shares ended lower on Wednesday, while U.S. stocks slid at midday in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today's developments confirm that the euro-zone's fiscal problems will continue to flash red on the markets' radar screen," said Marco Annunziata, chief economist at <span class="companylink">UniCredit</span> Group. "Fiscal positions are precarious in a number of countries, the government's response is too often hesitant and timid, and the lack of effective mechanisms to enforce fiscal discipline is exacerbating tensions between fiscal 'hawks' and 'doves'."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., new home-sales data unexpectedly fell in December, with single-family home sales dropping to 7.6% from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 342,000, said the U.S., Commerce Department. The weak report underscored the fragility of the nascent economic recovery in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time of the European stock markets close, the dollar rose against the euro ahead of the Fed rate decision. The euro was at $1.4051, from $1.4072 late Tuesday in New York, and sterling last traded at $1.6201 from $1.6143. The dollar was at 89.42 yen from 89.65 yen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late in Europe, light, sweet crude for March delivery was up four cents at $74.75 per barrel on the New York Mercantile exchange. Meanwhile, February gold futures were a touch lower as the dollar strengthened against the euro. The precious metal was down around $2 at $1097.50 per troy ounce, late in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In major market action: Banks were sharply lower in Europe on Wednesday, with BBVA losing 6.7% on the Bolsa de Madrid. The lender reported a 94% drop in fourth-quarter net income as it increased provisions for bad loans and took a write-down on the value of its U.S. businesses. BBVA's Spanish rival Santander, fell 5%, while <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> dropped 3.1% on the <span class="companylink">London Stock Exchange</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greek banks were under notable pressure, with Alpha Bank shares down 7.9%, weighing on the Greek ASE Composite Index, which fell 3.9% to 1,972.93. Credit default swaps against Greek debt rose to a record high on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">Wacker Chemie</span> declined 5.1% on the Xetra trading system after the Munich chemical firm said it expects to post a wider quarter-to-quarter loss after taking impairment charges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Tullow Oil</span> shares fell 4.6%. The oil producer said it has placed around 80.4 million new shares, or 9.99% of its share capital, at a price of £11.50 per share. It added that 2010 production is expected to drop to a range of 55,000 to 57,000 barrels of oil a day from 58,300 barrels in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the plus side, SAP shares rose 0.8% after the German business-software giant reported a 12% drop in fourth-quarter profit but also forecast that it will grow software-related revenue in 2010 even as the market continues to be challenging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of Dutch sports-car maker <span class="companylink">Spyker Cars</span> soared 41% on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange. Spyker late Tuesday agreed to buy Swedish car maker Saab from General Motors.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Philadelphia Story: Losing a Trophy Property</span>
</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi   </div><div>953 words</div><div>27 January 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A real-estate fund that is part of <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span>'s asset-management business tried to hold onto its properties as it recently restructured some $1.2 billion in debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 29-story office building at 2000 Market St. in Philadelphia is one of the buildings it lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund, <span class="companylink">RREEF America</span> REIT III, gave up the building in a deed-in-lieu-of-foreclosure transaction to Prudential Mortgage Capital Co., which held a $49 million mortgage on the property. In December, Prudential sold the property for about $56 million to another fund, CBRE Strategic Partners U.S. Value 5 Fund. The buyer paid Prudential nearly $49 million and also agreed to pay off about $7 million in unpaid construction costs related to the building, according to people familiar with the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale was one of the first involving a Philadelphia trophy property since the downturn, and delivered a tough benchmark to the deal-starved City of Brotherly Love. The black metal and glass tower, which is about 76% leased, went for about $85 a square foot, well below the $116-a-square-foot range that RREEF paid for the building in 2003. The price tag also was well below the $135-a-square-foot range that CB Richard Ellis Investors is said to have considered paying back in late 2007 before those talks fizzled, according to people familiar with the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not a pretty price but it's a price," said Robert Fahey, an executive vice president with <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group Inc</span>. who represented Prudential in the sale negotiations. "We have a data point that people can use to make judgments about other buildings."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total volume of office deals done in the Philadelphia area that were valued at $5 million or more shrank to $99 million last year from $747 million in 2008, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a New York real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal comes as many institutional investors have become disenchanted with the poor performance of some real-estate funds. Last year, <span class="companylink">RREEF America</span> REIT III was one of the harder hit funds, in part because it took on more risk than some funds and banked on a rising market. Instead, property values and rents have fallen, and the value of the fund's portfolio declined about 65% for the year ending Dec. 31, according to people familiar with the fund. It also was one of the few that warned investors that it might be forced to seek bankruptcy protection. Moreover, as recently as August the fund was considered a takeover target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">RREEF America</span> REIT III has taken steps to gain firmer footing. DeWitt Bowman, the RREEF fund's lead independent director, said the fund last month completed a restructuring of debt with multiple lenders. The $1.2 billion restructuring, which provides the fund with access to an additional $37 million of working capital, includes the participation of <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> as a lender in the restructured fund-level credit facility, the fund recently told investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout the process, RREEF attempted to restructure individual property loans on a no-cost basis. If an additional infusion of equity was required, the decision was made to give the asset back to the lender, as occurred with the Philadelphia building, people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only two other office properties in New Jersey, treated as one asset by the fund, have been given back by RREEF to lenders besides 2000 Market St., but there may be others, people familiar with the fund said. The total number of assets in the fund's portfolio stands at about 88, down from 93 in August as some properties also have been sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In an ideal world we'd have preferred to keep all the properties, but at the end of the day you have to roll with the punches and go with what the markets are indicating," Mr. Bowman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the fund's distressed properties, which hasn't been given back to a lender, is a stalled mixed-use development project in the Silicon Valley. <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span>. has filed a notice of default on a loan held by RREEF for the Sunnyvale, Calif., project, and a receiver was appointed to oversee the project, a bank spokeswoman said. Construction on Sunnyvale Town Center halted about midway through last year after RREEF and a development partner were unable to obtain additional construction financing, said John Pilger, a spokesman for the city of Sunnyvale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors said they were encouraged by the restructuring, but not persuaded that the end of the troubles is in sight. Annette St. Urbain, chief executive for the San Joaquin County Employees' Retirement Association, which has invested in the RREEF fund, said the move buys some time for property values and the economy to improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think they're out of the woods by any means," said Ms. St. Urbain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Burrichter, a principal of the CB Richard Ellis Investors' fund, which acquired the Philadelphia building, said he learned in the fall that efforts by the RREEF fund to sell the property to another buyer had fallen through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time it may have been easier to make a deal, in part because he acknowledged it is often easier to negotiate with lenders rather than owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It takes some of the emotion out of the sales process," Mr. Burrichter said. "They're often more inclined to make it work."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyers financed the acquisition with cash and a new loan from Prudential. Prudential officials declined to comment.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>870 words</div><div>27 January 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's new evidence the housing market is healing after a four-year slump, but the danger of further price drops remains amid persistent job-market weakness, according to The Wall Street Journal's quarterly housing survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of homes listed for sale are down sharply across the U.S. and have reached very low levels in some areas, including Boston and Sacramento, Calif. The decrease in supplies has sparked a return of bidding wars on lower-end properties in some neighborhoods, but the national picture is mixed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fundamental market drivers look relatively strong in the metropolitan areas of Minneapolis, Raleigh, N.C., Dallas, Houston and Washington, D.C., where mortgage-default rates are below the national average and job markets are likely to outperform the U.S. as a whole, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other areas look decidedly less hopeful. Miami, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Orlando, Jacksonville and Tampa, Fla., had the highest rates of defaulting borrowers among the 28 markets surveyed. The weakest job-market prospects this year were found in Tampa, Jacksonville, Las Vegas, Atlanta, Detroit and Phoenix, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jobs and mortgage woes will help shape the housing market this spring, the busiest time of year for home shoppers. Without a return to job growth, it will be hard to sustain demand and mortgage defaults will eventually lead to foreclosures, dumping more supply on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Miami-Fort Lauderdale, Fla., area, about 28% of mortgage borrowers are behind on payments or in foreclosure, according to LPS Applied Analytics, compared with 8.6% in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area and 13.2% in the entire U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, prices continue to stabilize in much of the nation. The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller 20-city composite index in November edged up 0.2% from October on a seasonally adjusted basis. It was down 5.3% from a year earlier and was about 29% below the peak set in 2006. In Las Vegas, the index was up 0.1% from the previous month, but still down 56% from the peak in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We'll probably be seeing a fairly strong spring selling season" in most of the nation, said Jody Kahn, a vice president at John Burns Real Estate Consulting. Her recent surveys of home builders across the U.S. showed shoppers have been out in greater numbers in recent weeks and seem more serious about buying. "Consumers are starting to feel a little more comfortable" that the worst of the job losses are past, Ms. Kahn said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A four-bedroom home in Woodbridge, Va., about 27 miles southwest of Washington, recently attracted 12 offers and sold for $217,000, far above the $175,900 asking price set by the foreclosing lender, said James Nellis II, an agent at RE/MAX Allegiance. The home had sold for $350,000 just two years earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason for such bidding wars is that many buyers can qualify for tax credits of as much as $8,000 if they agree on a home purchase by April 30. Meanwhile, economists say mortgage rates -- currently around 5% for standard 30-year fixed-rate loans -- are likely to be at least modestly higher later this year as the Federal Reserve withdraws support for the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> in New York say that rate could end the year at 5.10% to 5.25%. Mark Zandi of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com predicts 5.75%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes listed for sale is down sharply across the U.S., according to the survey. The supply would last four months or less at the current sales rate in the Boston, Sacramento, San Diego and San Francisco areas. A six-month supply is considered roughly balanced between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some builders said they were putting up more houses before receiving orders to be prepared for buyers seeking the tax credit this spring. "Don't delay!" said a flier that <span class="companylink">KB Home</span>, a national home builder, was handing out to prospective purchasers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But foreclosures could soon put downward pressure on prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than seven million households are behind on mortgage payments or in foreclosure, and lenders eventually will put many of those homes on the market. Unless the job market improves, it will be hard to find buyers for all those foreclosed homes and prices could again lurch lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There also remains a hard-to-measure "shadow" inventory of homes that will hit the market once more foreclosures are finalized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders haven't even started the foreclosure process -- which often takes more than a year -- for about 2.5 million households that are more than 90 days behind on payments, according to data from LPS Applied Analytics. It wasn't clear how many of those borrowers could be saved through loan modifications that cut payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, though the lower end of the housing market has generally gained strength over the past year, the market for higher-priced homes remains weak.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales plunged in December, raising fresh concerns over the housing market's ability to recover when government support winds down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell 16.7% from November to a 5.45 million annual rate, the National Association of Realtors said Monday, after a looming tax-credit deadline pushed buying decisions into previous months. The drop brought the pace of sales down to the lowest level since August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's first-time home-buyer tax credit was initially scheduled to end Nov. 30, and there was a race to finish deals before it expired. But the tax credit was eventually extended until spring, complemented by an additional tax break for repeat buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of 2009, there were 5.16 million home sales, up 4.9% from 4.91 million in 2008. It was the first annual sales gain since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although economists expected Monday's report to show declining December home sales, few thought they would fall so sharply. The decline called into question the sector's ability to bounce back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have a very fragile housing system," said Michael Carey, an economist with Calyon Securities in New York. He worried that as the government withdraws support from the housing market, prices could begin slipping again. That would put more homeowners into the position of owing more on their mortgage than their home is worth and could lead to another wave of foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be difficult to gauge how dependent on government support the housing market has become until the second half of the year. The current round of tax credits are for sales signed by the end of April and completed by the end of June. The looming expiration of those programs will likely create another sales surge in the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for a home sold in December was $178,300, up 4.9% from $170,000 in November and the largest monthly percentage price increase since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the jump likely occurred because higher-end homes made up a larger share of total sales with the drop in first-time home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, December sales fell 19.5% in the Northeast, 25.8% in the Midwest, 16.3% in the South and 4.8% in the West.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales in the U.S. plunged in December, dropping lower than expected after three straight increases that were fed by a big government tax credit</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales fell 16.7% to a 5.45 million annual rate from an unrevised 6.54 million in November, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. However inventories shrank and prices rose year over year for the first time in more than two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expected an 11.6% decrease in sales during December, to a rate of 5.78 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is going through a period of swings driven by the tax credit," NAR economist Lawrence Yun said. "We'll likely have another surge in the spring as home buyers take advantage of the extended and expanded tax credit."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Democrats' disaster in Massachusetts last Tuesday, U.S. President Barack Obama appears to be flailing. Gone is the cool and measured demeanor that made him look presidential when the financial crisis struck during the 2008 campaign. Instead, the financial-reform proposals he advanced later in the week seem to reflect political panic -- a desperate attempt to appeal to the populist sentiment against Wall Street. Unfortunately, they also reflect a limited understanding of good financial or banking policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, Mr. Obama has proposed to limit the size of banks or their holding companies, or both. The trouble with limiting the size of these institutions is that no one has the faintest idea what the right size is. What's more, if the purpose of the size limit is to prevent a bank or bank holding company from being or becoming too big to fail, we have to know what size would cause a failed institution to cause a financial train wreck. No one knows that, either. Under these circumstances, it's hard to take such a proposal seriously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, Mr. Obama says that some firms should be prohibited from engaging in "proprietary trading." The White House announcement seems to apply to both banks and bank holding companies, but there is a huge difference between them. A bank is chartered by the government, its deposits are insured, it can participate in the U.S. payment system, and it has access to the Federal Reserve's discount window. None of these things is true of a bank holding company -- which is an ordinary corporation that controls a bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because banks are government-backed, and privileged in many ways, their activities are limited by law and regulation. They are restricted in how they can use their insured deposits. The Glass-Steagall Act, despite what we constantly hear in the media and from people who should know better, still applies to banks; it forbids them from engaging in underwriting or dealing in securities. This should prohibit them from engaging in proprietary trading to the extent that this is dealing in securities. Bank holding companies, however, because they are not banks and not government-backed, can engage in any financial activity, including securities dealing. Why would we prohibit them from doing so when they are using their own funds?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apparently, Mr. Obama is arguing that bank holding companies should be prohibited from proprietary trading because it's too risky. The trouble is that proprietary trading is a profitable business for many bank holding companies, and there is no evidence that it caused serious losses for either banks or bank holding companies in the recent financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are strong firewalls between the holding companies and the banks they control that prevent the activities of the holding companies from affecting their bank subsidiaries. If Mr. Obama's plan is adopted, many bank holding companies will have to give up profitable businesses or sell off their banks. But even that wouldn't really solve the problem, since some would contend that large financial institutions like <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> and <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, even if they ceased being bank holding companies, would still be too big to fail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if Washington is going to stop <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> and <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> from taking risks in securities trading generally because they are too big to fail, why not stop securities trading by all large financial firms, such as investment banks or insurance companies? Even for a newly minted populist, this is a bit much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is one more factor to consider. Banks have been committing themselves increasingly to financing real estate. The reason for this is simple. Because they cannot underwrite or deal in securities, they have been losing out to securities firms in financing public companies -- that is, most of American business other than small business. It is less expensive for a company to issue notes, bonds or commercial paper in the securities markets than to borrow from a bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where, then, can banks find borrowers? The answer, unfortunately, is commercial and residential real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate loans rose to 55% of all bank loans in 2008 from less than 25% in 1965. These loans will continue to rise in the future, because only real-estate, small business and consumer lending are now accessible activities for banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not a good trend, because the real-estate sector is highly cyclical and volatile. It was, indeed, the vast number of subprime and other risky mortgages in the financial system that caused the weakness of the banks and the financial crisis. Requiring banks to continue to lend to real estate, because they have few other alternatives, virtually guarantees another banking crisis in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since banks can never be let out of these restrictions as long as they are government-backed, one solution for banking organizations is to center their activities in the bank holding company, which -- because it is not government-backed -- does not have to limit its range of activities. The fact that Mr. Obama now proposes to close off this one avenue through which banking organizations can be profitable is strong evidence that neither he nor his advisers, in attempting to lash out at banks, have thought through the long-term prospects and needs of the banking industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That might make good populist politics, but it is not responsible policy. Instead of trying to punish the banking industry, Mr. Obama should try to understand why banks have become so heavily invested in real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks must remain restricted in their range of activities, but bank holding companies are not banks. The solution to the long-term problems of the banking business is not to narrow the activities of bank holding companies, but to broaden them.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Justin Lahart </div><div>312 words</div><div>26 January 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales plunged in December, raising fresh concerns about the housing market's ability to recover when government support winds down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell 16.7% from November to a 5.45 million annual rate, the National Association of Realtors said Monday, after a looming tax-credit deadline pushed buying decisions into previous months. The drop brought the pace of sales down to the lowest level since August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's first-time home-buyer tax credit was initially scheduled to end Nov. 30, and there was a race to finish deals before it expired. But the tax credit was eventually extended until spring, complemented by an additional tax break for repeat buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of 2009, there were 5.16 million home sales, up 4.9% from 4.91 million in 2008. It was the first annual sales gain since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although economists expected Monday's report to show declining December home sales, few thought they would fall so sharply. The decline called into question the sector's ability to bounce back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have a very fragile housing system," said Michael Carey, an economist with Calyon Securities in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He worried that as the government withdraws support from the housing market, prices could begin slipping again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would put more homeowners into the position of owing more on their mortgage than their home is worth and could lead to another wave of foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for a home sold in December was $178,300, up 4.9% from $170,000 in November and the largest monthly percentage price increase since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the jump likely occurred because higher-end homes made up a larger share of total sales with the drop in first-time home buyers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures Mask Signs of Life in Housing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market isn't yet in the clear, but it's also not as weak as Monday's home-sales report might suggest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors is expected to announce an 11.6% drop in December existing-home sales to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.78 million, according to economists polled by Dow Jones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The large drop is exaggerated by the initial Nov. 30 expiration of the government's first-time home-buyer tax credit, which previously boosted sales by some 28% from August through November to an annualized rate of 6.5 million units, the most since early 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit has been extended through June, but most analysts don't expect sales growth to resume until February or March. In the meantime, further declines in existing-home sales, which make up nearly 90% of the market, are sure to raise concerns about the recovery in housing and the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are scattered signs of improvement. Home-price declines have slowed; the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index out Tuesday is expected to show prices in 20 major cities down about 5.4% in November from a year ago, compared with a trough of nearly 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of new homes are down to their lowest level in nearly 40 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales, which the Commerce Department reports Wednesday, are expected to rise 4.2% to an annualized pace of 370,000 units after a sharp decline the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction added to gross domestic product in the third quarter for the first time since 2005, and is expected to provide additional support to GDP this year and next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, one of the sector's most reliable leading indicators, building permits, have risen for two straight months, including a 10.9% surge in December, and are up about 15% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, a bellwether state for housing, inventories of existing homes hit a five-year low in December of 3.8 months' supply, according to the California Association of Realtors, from a high of 16.6 months in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think recovery is underway, but there will be bumps in the road," said <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> economist Michelle Meyer. In other word, bumps don't portend a double downward dip.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jim Carlton </div><div>678 words</div><div>23 January 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- California's inventory of unsold, previously owned homes shrank to a five-year low in December, in another sign that the state may be coming out of its worst housing slump in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of unsold single-family homes dropped to 3.8 months from 5.6 months a year ago and 16.6 months in January 2008, when inventories were at a peak, according to estimates released Friday by the California Association of Realtors. The inventory levels are now at their lowest level since 2005, resulting in frenzied sales with multiple offers in some cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Northern California's Santa Clara County, where inventory has dropped to 50 days from 243 a year ago, Amanda Garcia said she and her father Luis Garcia finally gave up a nine-month search for a home last month, after they kept losing out on homes priced in the highly competitive sub-$500,000 market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's more like an auction nowadays," said Ms. Garcia, 26 years old, a medical coordinator from Milpitas, Calif. "They shouldn't call it a house sale."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California's housing market is closely watched because it is the nation's biggest and helps fuel both the state's economy and the U.S. building industry. With California still weighed down by economic problems, economists are looking at bellwethers such as housing to determine when California will rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, any long-term revival in housing will depend on California's ability to shake off its high unemployment and the threat of more foreclosures. Some housing experts cautioned that inventories may be artificially low because many would-be sellers are waiting for the economy to improve before putting homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm convinced that once the general public believes prices have bottomed out and are coming up, more people will put their homes on the market," said Andrew LePage, an analyst at MDA <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>, a housing-data provider in La Jolla, Calif. "And that will probably coincide with the economy and job market improving."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although most home prices remain well below their pre-bust highs of three years ago, California's overall housing market has shown signs of stabilizing since early last year. The median price of an existing, single-family home rose 8.4% from a year ago to $306,820, marking the second consecutive year-over-year increase and the 10th straight month-over-month jump, according to estimates by the state Realtors' association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales rose at a slower year-over-year rate of 1.7%, compared with double-digit gains in recent months. Sales have been powered, in part, by a federal tax credit for first-time buyers, which Congress extended until the end of April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some brokers attributed the sales slowdown to lean inventories. "Right now, we need more listings," said Lianne Pinkston, a Coldwell Banker broker in Morgan Hill, Calif., south of San Jose. "I have an all-cash investor, and they've wanted to buy a duplex or fourplex, and they've been making all-cash offers for over the asking price, and they're still not getting anything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current inventory rate is running well under California's historical average since the 1980s of about an eight-month supply of existing homes on the market. That is partly because a once huge supply of foreclosures in the state has dwindled. In November, foreclosed properties accounted for 40% of all single-family sales, new and used, in California, compared with 58% in January, according to the most recent estimates by <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>, a market tracker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, California's coastal markets performed better than inland ones. In Orange County, for example, Zillow estimates foreclosures dropped by more than one half to 20.6% of all single-family sales in November from 43.5% in January. In inland Merced County, foreclosures were also down, but to 69.9% of sales from 83.4% in January, according to Zillow.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About to start that summer home-remodeling project? Read these tips first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For anyone who has ever put their home on the market, you know that feeling you get when you've spruced up the whole house for sale and inevitably some potential buyer tours your home says: "Maybe we should keep our house and just remodel."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This may be especially true when you look at the cost of replacing your house. According to the National Association of Realtors, U.S. homes have appreciated 6.8% annually on average since 1968, compared with inflation during the same period at an annual clip of 5.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the American Homeowner's Foundation estimates that it can cost up to 10% of a house's value to replace it with another, even one that costs exactly the same. That's because real estate transaction costs are high, including agent commissions, mortgage fees, transfer taxes, attorney costs, title searches, surveys, movers and the like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus selling one $200,000 house and buying another of similar value could set you back as much as $20,000. So, when looking both at home appreciations and the cost of moving, it may make sense to stay put.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimated 1 million homeowners per year undertake a remodeling project, boosting what was a $230 billion industry in 2003. The decision of whether to sell a house, or stay and remodel, is one that is based on many factors, including what type of changes you want to make, how long you plan to stay in the house and the cost of the remodeling in comparison to the value of your home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rules of the house</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts say there are at least two rules of thumb when it comes to remodeling your house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, you should not increase the value of your house to a point where it is the most expensive home in your neighborhood. This could make it difficult to sell the house in a competitive housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, you should strive to keep your new mortgage debt below 80% of your home's new appraised value. Not only does this keep you below the debt/equity ratio requiring you to pay private mortgage insurance on the new loan, but it also ensures you don't assume a monthly payment that precludes you from having a balanced household budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best improvements for your dollar</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remodeling magazine conducts an annual survey of the remodeling projects that add the most value to your home. The survey compares how the same 18 remodeling projects affected home values in 60 different cities. The 2004 survey, the most recent, was the 18th for the magazine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Remodeling, the top five remodeling projects in 2004, ranked in the order of percent of cost recouped at home resale, included minor kitchen remodel (92.9% of cost recouped), siding replacement (92.8%), midrange bathroom remodel (90.1%), deck addition (86.7%), and midrange bathroom addition (86.4%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exact figures can vary greatly based on the housing market in your area. When housing prices are rising rapidly, remodeling costs can be recouped faster. In addition, if your remodel simply catches your house up to the others in your neighborhood -- say, adding a third-car garage to your home when all other homes in your neighborhood already have the same -- this type of improvement could actually recoup more than the cost. See the 2004 survey.  [http://www.remodeling.hw.net/industry-news.asp?articleID=79166§ionID=173]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question of how much to spend on remodeling could also depend on whether the changes could be categorized as maintenance or remodeling. Maintenance improvements would be things like replacing the roof, carpet, or repainting. In addition, maintenance projects that focus on energy efficiency may have an even quicker payback than standard remodeling. Replacing windows, adding insulation and upgrading to more-efficient air and heating units are good examples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may also be important to consider how much enjoyment you will get out of the improvement. A home office, pool or gazebo may enhance your family's quality of life, but experts say these are examples of remodeling projects that rarely give anywhere close to 100% payback at resale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting the right help</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once you decide on a remodeling project, you still have to choose from among the estimated 800,000 companies and individuals who identify themselves as remodelers in the U.S. Experts advise asking some basic questions of a prospective contractor such as:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How long have you been in business?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will employees or subcontractors be assigned to the project?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How many projects like mine have you completed in the past year?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May I have a list of references?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't rely on just one estimate for any job, as costs can vary by 10% or more among companies. And make sure you understand what is included in each bid so that you can accurately compare. On a roofing job, for instance, the grade of shingles, type of sheathing and kind of flashing could vary, meaning a lower bid might also represent lower quality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, one of the most important questions you may need to ask is whether the contractor has liability insurance -- for themselves as well as any subcontractors they plan to use. Don't hesitate to ask to see an actual certificate of coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, make sure that your own homeowner's dwelling insurance is raised to include the value of the newly remodeled house as the work is completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By sticking to these suggestions, you will be enjoying your new remodel job both now, and for many years to come.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sells Aspen-Area Estate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas Rangers owner Tom Hicks, whose Hicks Sports Group is in default on $525 million of debt, sold his three-acre, Aspen-area estate to Howard M. Jenkins, the former head of the Southeastern <span class="companylink">Publix Super Markets</span> chain, for $18.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides the baseball team, which Mr. Hicks is in the process of selling to an investor group, his Sports Group owns the NHL's Dallas Stars. Separately, he owns England's <span class="companylink">Liverpool Football Club</span>. The Snowmass Village, Colo., property, with an original $20 million asking price, has a main house and a guest house totaling 11,000 square feet. Mr. Hicks sold the contemporary homes furnished. The ski-in, ski-out property also has a pool, and the two homes share a driveway. The 58-year-old Mr. Jenkins, who has a home for sale in the area, said he plans to use the property as a getaway for his family and friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hicks bought the property in 1995 for $1.03 million and says he's selling because his family has been vacationing elsewhere in recent years. Mr. Jenkins, a son of <span class="companylink">Publix</span> founder George W. Jenkins, still sits on the board of <span class="companylink">Publix</span>. Chris Lewis of Chaffin Light Real Estate represented Mr. Hicks and George Huggins, also of Chaffin Light, Mr. Jenkins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Palmer Asks $11.5 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Restaurant Building</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Restaurateur and celebrity chef Charlie Palmer is asking $11.5 million for the five-story Manhattan townhouse that housed his first restaurant, Aureole, and former apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 21-foot-wide Upper East Side townhouse is zoned for living and working. (Aureole moved to a bigger space in June.) Restaurant, office and prep space comprise the first three floors and the basement. The fourth floor is split into two apartments and the fifth, currently rented, is a 1,220-square-foot one-bedroom with a terrace. The third floor can also be used as residential space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Palmer, 50, who oversees a sprawling empire of restaurants, wine shops and a boutique hotel, bought the building in 1987 to open Aureole. He lived on the fifth floor until the early 1990s: "It was a little too close to work; you'd find yourself never leaving the building," he says. Maria Manuche of <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span> has the listing with Nick Poshkus, also of Corcoran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australian Golfer Scott</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Offers Beachfront House</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australian golfer Adam Scott has put his beachfront vacation home on Australia's Gold Coast on the market for 4.95 million Australian dollars, or about US$4.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scott, 29, who has been ranked as high as third in the world, bought the duplex apartment in 2004 for A$4.4 million. He is selling because his schedule has kept him from using the property, a representative says. The roughly 3,650-square-foot apartment has three bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms, Italian limestone floors and floor-to-ceiling windows with views of the Pacific.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property includes a private garden and outdoor spa. Alex Caraco of Coldwell Banker GC Property Group has the listing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO -- <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>. is trying to sell a popular ski resort in northern Japan that it purchased nearly four years ago, the company's latest effort to repay the U.S. government for its bailout, people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> was initially asking between $70 million and $80 million for the property. That would mark a gain from the $54 million the bank paid in 2006 for a bigger collection of properties that included the resort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The likely buyer would come from a non-Japanese Asian country, underscoring the recent shift in the tenor of the market, away from one dominated by property funds reliant on bank loans to one led by cash-rich Southeast Asian and Chinese investors eager to secure a foothold in the world's second-largest economy and property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Investors from around Asia are looking to snap up hotels being sold by companies keen to raise capital," said Raymond Clement, the Asia-based broker for service provider CB Richard Ellis Hotels Group. He believes there will be a sharp pickup in deals for Japanese hotels this year, led by Asian investors seeking trophy assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> hired property-services firm <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> to contact potential buyers about the resort on the island of Hokkaido last autumn. Most of the property funds quickly dropped out because they couldn't raise enough debt. The sale is now in "advanced stages," the people said, though they declined to say whether it had yet been narrowed to one bidder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest from Asian investors in Japanese hotels has picked up in recent years. Singapore-based Park Hotel Group bought the Hilton Otaru in December 2008, also in Hokkaido, and said it wanted to expand in Japan. Although hotel-occupancy rates in Japan were falling, it said it expected Japan to attract more tourists from Southeast Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend has been a boon to bankers looking to raise capital. A real-estate fund managed by <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> completed the sale of its Crowne Plaza Kobe hotel to Thai Charoen Corp. last year. The hotel was the Thai conglomerate's first business in Japan. <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> also sold its Westin Tokyo hotel in 2008 to Singapore's largest sovereign-wealth fund, the <span class="companylink">Government of Singapore Investment Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> raised about $11 billion last year from Japan by selling assets as diverse as a local brokerage and a call center. Last month, it repaid the U.S. government $20 billion, but Washington remains the company's largest shareholder, with a roughly 27% stake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hokkaido resort has proved a tough sell. Even the big Asian investors are nervous about the direction of property prices, particularly outside Tokyo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan's regions are mostly failing economically, losing population, and property prices are continuing a long slump. National land prices fell in the year to July at the fastest pace in five years, according to government data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skiing in Japan grew from the 1970s in step with middle-class incomes, as the young sought a pastime with a chic image. But the ski boom quickly faded as the economy sagged. In recent years, the strong yen has also hit tourism. The number of skiers and snowboarders slipped from a peak of 18.6 million in 1993 to 6.9 million in 2008, according to the Japan Productivity Center, a policy and research group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A buyer has to be convinced that <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>'s resort will buck the slow decline of Japan's hinterland. The resort, in an area called Niseko, is dotted with bars, restaurants and live-music venues, a contrast to many other Japanese winter resorts where people often eat in their hotel and go to bed early.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resort gets an average of 11 meters of snow a year, making it one of the snowiest resorts on earth. Asia's affluent, particularly Australians and more-lately mainland Chinese, started coming more frequently after Sept. 11, 2001, when many wanted to avoid travel to places such as Aspen and Davos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citigroup Principal Investments Japan bought seven ski sites, three golf courses and two hotels from Seibu Holdings Inc. for $54 million, according to data provider Dealogic. That included the Hokkaido property now on the market. The deal was signed in June 2006, just when property prices looked to be recovering from the collapse of the bubble of the 1990s. Land prices rose in 2006 for the first time in 16 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition for assets was intense at the time, fueled by property loans from foreign banks. But then the property market slumped in 2008 as foreign investment banks slashed real-estate lending to preserve capital during the financial crisis. Japanese banks also turned more cautious on property lending as the domestic economy sank into recession. Property developers and construction firms accounted for the greatest number of bankruptcies during the crisis.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virginia police charged Christopher Speight, the lone suspect in a mass shooting Tuesday, with first-degree murder Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The charge came one day after a killing spree that claimed the lives of eight people in and around Mr. Speight's home in Appamattox County, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also came just hours after the suspect, 39 years old, surrendered to authorities after a 19-hour-long search through the woods of the rural area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Police identified the victims in the shooting as Joshua Sipe, 4 years old; Lauralee Sipe, 38; Dwayne Sipe, 38; Emily Quarles, 15; Jonathan Quarles, 43; Karen Quarles, 43; Morgan Dobyns, 15; and Ronald Scruggs II, 16. All of the victims were from Appamattox, except for Mr. Scruggs, who police said was from Dillwyn, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Police say further charges are pending against Mr. Speight.. They said the suspect was "acquainted with" the victims, but declined to say what relationship he had to them. Authorities haven't offered a motive in the slayings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier Wednesday, police said they found multiple explosives at the home of Mr. Speight. Technicians detonated the devices Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cold Weather Chills</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Construction</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction fell in December, as bad weather kept construction crews from breaking ground. But an increase in newly issued building permits suggested the decline was only temporary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, inflation at the wholesale level was muted last month, as higher food prices were offset by a decline in energy prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of new-home starts in December fell 4% from November to a seasonally adjusted 557,000 annual rate, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Single-family construction declined 6.9% to 456,000. Construction of apartment buildings and other multifamily units rose 12.2% to 101,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month was the coldest December in nine years in the contiguous 48 states, with several winter storms. Because home-building activity is always low during the winter months, weather can have an outsize effect on the construction figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Small distortions can really add up in December," said <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> economist Michael Feroli. "You don't need a whole lot of change to swing the seasonally adjusted number around."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 19% in the Northeast and 18.5% in the Midwest, both regions that were buffeted by snowstorms in December. Starts fell 0.9% in the West and rose 3.3% in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newly issued building permits rose 10.9% in December to a 653,000 annual rate, the highest level since October 2008. Less likely to have been affected by weather, the permit level suggests construction activity will pick up in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were a total of 553,800 housing units started last year, down 38.8% from 2008 and about a third of the average over the previous 50 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Wednesday, the Labor Department reported that its index of wholesale, or "producer," prices rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2% last month from November. Food prices rose 1.4%, but energy prices fell 0.4%. Core producer prices, which exclude food and energy prices, were flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with a year earlier, producer prices were up 4.4.%. That largely reflected a rebound in oil prices from a steep fall at the end of last year; excluding food and energy, prices were up 0.9%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jim Carlton </div><div>677 words</div><div>21 January 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A15A</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bay Area homeowners haven't had much to cheer about in the past few years amid the nationwide housing-market meltdown. Now there's a glimmer of good news: The local housing market last year began showing signs of a tentative, albeit uneven, recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities closer to the coast such as Palo Alto, Belvedere and Tiburon saw a return to year-over-year price gains of previously sold homes in 2009, according to MDA <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>, a data provider in La Jolla, Calif. But other towns in harder-hit inland areas like Vacaville and Vallejo mostly lagged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, though, the region last year fared much better than in 2008. In 2009's fourth quarter, 29 of 91 cities or communities around the Bay posted gains in the median price of an existing single-family home from the same period a year earlier. In contrast, only two cities or communities logged such gains in 2008, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>. The 2009 quarterly data didn't include the last week of December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We appear to be in the early stages of a fragile recovery," said Andrew LePage, a <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> analyst. Still, he noted that the median home prices in most Bay Area cities and communities remained well off their peaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coastal communities with lower inventories of homes for sale dominated the increases, accounting for 24 of the 29 areas that posted price gains. They included San Francisco, with a 4.8% year-over-year rise in the median home price to $715,000, Oakland, up 11.1% to a median $211,000, and San Jose, up 4.4% to a median $470,000. The biggest gainer was Palo Alto, where the median home price more than doubled from a year ago to $1.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inland cities with more foreclosures, such as Vallejo and Vacaville, were among the top decliners, though the biggest drop was in Marin County's Greenbrae, where median prices plummeted more than 27% to $1.02 million last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> cautioned that the sharp price fluctuations in some cities are partly attributable to a shifting mix of homes sold and a low number of transactions. For example, more high-end homes sold in Palo Alto would help boost its median price, while a shift to more lower-end homes in Greenbrae could depress its median.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When shown by another indicator -- the median change in the price per square foot sold -- some communities that gained in overall price didn't fare quite as well. The ritzy Belvedere-Tiburon area, for example, saw its median price per square foot dip 4% year over year, even though its overall median price jumped 30.8% last year to $2.55 million, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>. Still, Palo Alto's price per square foot soared 98.7% last year, and real-estate agents there have reported brisk sales. Agent Ken DeLeon said he sold 21 homes in Palo Alto in 2009, up from 14 in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another hopeful sign in the market, bidding wars have returned. In Palo Alto, Jay and Jen Borenstein bested 21 other bidders in November to buy a two-bedroom, two-bath home near Stanford University's campus that was listed for $729,000. Their winning bid: $1 million, or 37% above the asking price. The property was valued at about $1.5 million in 2008, according to estimates by <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My feeling is this is a good value," said Mr. Borenstein, 39 years old, a computer-science lecturer at Stanford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less competitive are parts of inland areas like Morgan Hill, where a couple this month closed escrow on a five-bedroom home they bought for $585,000, which was $15,000 below the asking price, said their broker, Lianne Pinkston. Ms. Pinkston said the bank-owned property, on 3.8 acres outside Morgan Hill and zoned for horses, drew only one other bid.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAS VEGAS -- Housing construction is expected to rebound this year from the severely depressed 2009 level, but the market remains fragile as foreclosures continue to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are likely to start construction on 610,000 single-family homes this year, up 38% from last year, according to David Crowe, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, which is meeting this week for its annual convention. That forecast assumes that the total number of U.S. jobs will start growing again in the second quarter. Housing starts would remain far below the 2005 peak of 1.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Crowe cautioned that the housing market remains tenuous, partly because foreclosures are still increasing, job growth this year is likely to be tepid, and builders are having trouble getting credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The convention drew more than 50,000 builders, suppliers and other participants, down from more than 60,000 last year and 140,000 in 2007, a spokeswoman for the home builders said. Many suppliers were touting energy-efficient products rather than glitzy decor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward Sullivan, chief economist of the Portland Cement Association, a trade group, was more cautious. He forecast single-family housing starts of 512,000 this year, up 20%. Mr. Sullivan said housing demand will be held back by a sluggish job recovery, foreclosures, continued tight lending standards, the expiry of a tax credit for home purchases in April and possibly higher interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than three miles from the convention, around 60 people perched on folding chairs in a parking lot to bid on foreclosed homes, a daily feature of the Las Vegas market. About 60% of Las Vegas home sales in December were foreclosed properties, according to the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many builders are focusing on low-cost homes to compete with foreclosures. In Las Vegas, the typical new house from <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> is priced in a range of about $150,000 to $170,000. Four years ago, typical new homes in Las Vegas were in a range of $400,000 to $550,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Nothaft, chief economist at the government-backed mortgage investor <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, said the percentage of people who are behind on their mortgage payments probably won't peak until the second half. As of Sept. 30, about 14% of American home-mortgage borrowers were at least 30 days behind on payments or in foreclosure, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also speaking at the convention, David Berson, chief economist of <span class="companylink">PMI Group</span>, said it may be three years before U.S. house prices return to a normal growth rate of around 4% a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Burns Real Estate Consulting, an Irvine, Calif., firm that advises home builders, said sales of new homes and visits from potential buyers have picked up in recent weeks after a lull in last year's final quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many builders are starting the year with low inventories of completed homes, the firm said. That should spur building in the months ahead as builders seek to have houses ready for people who want to make purchases before the April 30 deadline to qualify for a tax credit for home purchases.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anton Troianovski </div><div>834 words</div><div>20 January 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C12</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is difficult to get a construction loan these days. But it helps to own land across the street from a major hospital in a well-off Los Angeles suburb and to know three wealthy people willing to backstop the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developer Randall Miller, 28 years old, is finally set to break ground on a three-story medical-office building in Santa Monica, Calif., after years of wrangling among authorities, lenders and a succession of landowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller's project is a rare example of new development moving forward in the wake of an economic downturn still hammering commercial real estate. It also is evidence of the tough new financing environment facing developers even as banks say they want to get back to making new loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the country, construction of investment property is at a near standstill. In 63 core markets tracked by data analytics firm <span class="companylink">CoStar Group Inc</span>., developers started construction on only 3.2 million square feet in office-building space in the last three months of 2009, an 88% decrease from two years before. The volume of construction loans outstanding for commercial real-estate projects was $266 billion in the third quarter of last year, a 9% decline from the previous quarter, according to another data firm, Foresight Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts say that banks and insurance companies are slowly loosening their lending spigot -- but at much stiffer terms than they did during the boom. "The availability of capital to borrow is higher than it was in 2008 and 2009," says Jeffrey Havsy, global strategist for Property &amp;Portfolio Research, a CoStar company. "The difference is the standards at which you can borrow."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was about a year ago when Mr. Miller negotiated a lease with the University of California, Los Angeles, for an outpatient facility on his site to complement its Santa Monica hospital. Then the trouble began. The <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. in February hit Mr. Miller's prospective construction lender, First Regional Bank, with a cease-and-desist order that accused it of "safe and unsound banking practices." Mr. Miller said the bank called him, saying that it wouldn't be able to make the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas McCullough, chief operating officer of First Regional Bank, says he didn't know the circumstances of Mr. Miller's situation, but that the bank hasn't reneged on any commitments it has made. "It's possible they didn't get far enough along in the process to have a commitment," Mr. McCullough says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For months after First Regional withdrew its loan, Mr. Miller says, he couldn't interest any banks even though he had already secured a long-term lease with UCLA. "We've got a 30-year lease essentially with the state of California," Mr. Miller says. "If this project can't get financed, then what possibly could?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the problem: Only one of Mr. Miller's investors had signed on to personally guarantee the loan. That wouldn't have been an issue in the go-go days, when banks were often willing to make loans with little or no personal guarantees from the borrowers. Last month, after Mr. Miller persuaded two other investors to guarantee the loan, US Bank, a subsidiary of Minneapolis-based <span class="companylink">US Bancorp</span>, finally agreed to lend $28 million for the project. David Pelaia, Mr. Miller's loan officer at US Bank, says he hopes to close the deal by early next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rudy Kramer, who runs US Bank's Los Angeles office, says that "sponsorship" -- the people willing to guarantee a loan -- is paramount in the bank's decision on whether or not to issue credit. "We focus on the sponsorship first, then secondarily the real estate," Mr. Kramer says. Mr. Kramer says his office made six new commercial-real-estate loans, including three construction loans, in the last three months of 2009 after making only one loan in the first three quarters of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller also benefited from continuing demand by hospitals for more space and their increasing willingness to lease new space in smaller, off-campus buildings from private developers rather than to build it themselves. "We felt that a private medical-office-building developer would be able to assemble the property and develop a building in a manner that would be more efficient and cost-effective than the university would," says Brad Erickson, UCLA's director of campus services enterprises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Santa Monica is well known for its long development-approval process but, over two years, Mr. Miller has surmounted most of the hurdles. Mr. Miller, who was represented by commercial-real-estate brokerage Madison Partners, is now waiting for the building permit that will allow him to start construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new building will face the Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center and Orthopaedic Hospital on 16th Street in Santa Monica. It is slated to open next year.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>1993 words</div><div>19 January 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Stevens bought his first home almost 25 years ago, paying just 3% down with a loan backed by the Federal Housing Administration. "I had no money in the bank," he says. "If it weren't for the FHA, I wouldn't have gotten that home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, as FHA commissioner, Mr. Stevens has to decide how many others to let through that door. Souring FHA-insured mortgages are threatening the agency's finances. Congress is pressuring him to tighten the easy-money standards that once helped people like him, and he is expected to announce revisions as early as this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But raising the credit bar could have a dangerous side effect. In many of the nation's hardest-hit housing markets, the FHA backs around half of all new home loans. If the agency pulls back too quickly, the nascent housing recovery could fizzle, endangering the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dilemma puts the 52-year-old former mortgage banker squarely in the middle of the debate over how much the government should do to prop up the housing market, and how much risk taxpayers should take on to do it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"How big a role do we need to play to keep the housing system functioning?" says Mr. Stevens, referring to the FHA. "Overcorrecting in either direction would be a terrible thing to do right now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stevens is finalizing possible revisions to credit standards. Options include raising the minimum down payment, establishing a minimum credit score, increasing the amount that borrowers have to pay for mortgage insurance, and reducing the amount of money sellers can kick in for closing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FHA, created in 1934 to heal the U.S. housing market during the Great Depression, traditionally has helped first-time home buyers and underserved segments of the market. It doesn't lend money to home buyers, but insures lenders against default on loans that meet FHA criteria, collecting fees for that backing. For decades, thanks to a stable housing market, it turned a profit for taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the housing market was booming, subprime lenders drew away many of the borrowers who traditionally used FHA-backed loans by offering even more favorable terms. Unlike the FHA, subprime lenders didn't require borrowers to document their incomes. The FHA saw its share of the mortgage market fall to 2% in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when the subprime market collapsed, mortgage brokers began steering borrowers into FHA-backed loans. Politicians and policy makers encouraged the FHA to refinance at-risk borrowers into fixed-rate loans. Suddenly, the FHA had an enormous chunk of the market. Average credit scores of FHA borrowers dropped sharply at first. In last year's third quarter, the FHA insured 25% of mortgages, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We should not play this large a role," Mr. Stevens says. "It's not healthy for the mortgage-finance system, it's not healthy for the economy, and it's certainly not sustainable for the long term."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FHA, which is part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, isn't as nimble as private mortgage insurers. It must get approval from Congress for some major decisions. "They don't have the horsepower that they should, especially given the size of their operations," says Ann Schnare, a mortgage-industry consultant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In testimony before Congress last month, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan acknowledged that the FHA "we inherited" was "not properly managing or monitoring its risk. Credit and risk controls were antiquated. Enforcement was weak. And our personnel resources and IT systems were inadequate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stevens knows the industry well. He is the first FHA commissioner in nearly two decades to bring extensive private-sector experience to the job. During the 1980s, he was a top salesman of complex adjustable-rate mortgages for <span class="companylink">World Savings Bank</span>, a California thrift. He went on to hold senior jobs at housing-finance giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp;Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his off time, he plays guitar, rides his <span class="companylink">BMW</span> motorcycle and skis the backcountry. On the job, he gets his way through sheer "force of personality," says Eugene McQuade, once Mr. Stevens's boss when they worked at Freddie and now chief executive of <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>.'s Citibank unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Stevens arrived in July 2009, the FHA didn't have anyone in charge of monitoring risk, including whether certain loan products or lenders were exposing the agency to excessive losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his second week on the job, Mr. Stevens suspended the FHA license for <span class="companylink">Taylor, Bean &amp;Whitaker Mortgage Corp</span>., one of the nation's top lenders, amid concerns that the company was originating too many bad loans. Taylor Bean closed its doors the next day. In November, he hired the agency's first chief risk officer and five Ph.D. economists to help evaluate risk. That same month, FHA cut off <span class="companylink">Lend America</span>, another major lender, which also closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are still signs of trouble. At about 30 FHA-approved lenders with at least 1,000 loan originations, more than 12% of loans are in default two years after origination, nearly double the national average at the end of November. Last Tuesday, HUD's inspector general served subpoenas on 15 of those lenders as part of an examination of the practices of lenders with high default rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The percentage of FHA-backed loans that defaulted after borrowers made just one payment -- typically an indication of poor underwriting or fraud -- has started to fall, but not as fast as needed to avoid future loan losses. FHA-insured mortgages made in 2007 and 2008 are largely responsible for the agency's precarious position, with default rates approaching 24%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FHA officials concede that the agency offers today's easiest underwriting standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stevens, nevertheless, lashes out at critics who say the FHA is repeating the mistakes of subprime lenders. At a conference in November, Robert Toll, chief executive of luxury-home builder <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>., referred to the FHA as "the new subprime" and "a definite train wreck" that will soon need a bailout, according to a transcript of his remarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stevens, in an interview, called the comparison "ludicrous," and said Mr. Toll has "no clue" about the agency's finances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency is required by Congress to hold enough capital in reserve to cover 30 years of projected losses. An independent audit said reserves at the end of September exceeded projected losses by just $3.6 billion, about 0.5% of the $685 billion in loans outstanding, down from 3% a year earlier. Congress requires the agency to maintain a 2% capital-reserve ratio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FHA officials say they have enough cash to cover the current level of losses, and that the agency risks running out of money only if home prices take another big dive. "We've learned from recent history that the market is fragile, and we have to plan for the unexpected," Mr. Donovan, the HUD secretary, said last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some analysts say the agency's assumptions about home prices and foreclosures are too optimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"FHA is, at best, running on empty, and probably is facing a negative capital situation," Ms. Schnare, the industry consultant, told a congressional panel last month. If the agency were to run short of cash to cover projected losses, it likely would have to ask Congress for money for the first time ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bad-loan problem stems, in part, from controversial programs that allowed home builders and other sellers to fund down payments for home buyers through nonprofit groups. After a lengthy effort, the FHA prevailed on Congress to shut the programs down in October 2008, but the damage already was done. The FHA's independent audit concluded that were it not for such programs, the agency's capital-reserve ratio would have stayed above the 2% mandated by law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another troubling practice, by late 2007, institutional investors were identifying at-risk mortgages in their portfolios and refinancing the borrowers into FHA-backed loans, thereby offloading their risk onto the agency. "It was an unintentional bailout of financial institutions," says David Lykken, a partner at Mortgage Banking Solutions, an Austin, Texas, consulting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the raft of measures Mr. Stevens is considering to protect and replenish the agency's reserves is raising the minimum down payment. The current minimum of 3.5% is far lower than what private lenders offer, making FHA-backed loans one of the last low-down-payment options left. Last year, through August, nearly seven in eight new FHA-backed loans carried down payments of less than 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders are worried. "It would be a game changer for the industry" if down payments were raised, says Eric Lipar, chief executive of LGI Homes, a Texas-based builder of entry-level homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone believes that such low down payments are good. In markets where home values are still falling, buyers who put little money down could see their equity wiped out quickly. The FHA is "just manufacturing more upside-down homeowners by the truckload in Arizona, California, and Nevada," says Brett Barry, a Phoenix real-estate agent who specializes in selling foreclosed homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the agency were to raise down payments sharply in those markets, price declines would become a "self-fulfilling prophecy," says Mr. Stevens. "If you stop lending, you're going to perpetuate the declines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stevens says first-time buyers are key to clearing inventory in markets such as Las Vegas. James Smith, a 42-year-old air-conditioning repairman, might not have been able to buy a $188,000 home out of foreclosure recently in Henderson, Nev., were it not for the low FHA down payments. To make the 3.5% payment, he used around $4,300 of his own money and borrowed the rest from this father-in-law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was actually a great thing," he says. He repaid his father-in-law after receiving an $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers. Mr. Smith, who earns around $50,000 annually, makes monthly payments of $1,466.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stevens says he expects to get heat from industry and consumer groups no matter what he decides to do to tighten credit standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as the FHA considers how to scale back, some members of Congress are pushing it to expand its role. In 2008, in the midst of the credit crisis, Congress temporarily raised the maximum FHA loan from $362,790 to as high as $729,750 for the most expensive housing markets. Lawmakers have introduced a bill to make that increase permanent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A $500,000 loan in Massachusetts is like a $300,000 loan in Nebraska," says Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Barney Frank, who favors raising limits to $800,000 in the most expensive markets. "All we're trying to do is control for geography."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stevens argues the expanded limits should stay temporary, in keeping with the FHA's traditional focus on first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FHA says the loans it is guaranteeing these days will turn a profit because the credit profile of its borrowers has improved. The average credit score for FHA borrowers has risen to 681, from 630 two years ago. The median U.S. score is about 720. Much of the improvement came as the FHA's lenders raised their own credit standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stevens, for his part, is painfully aware of how far the housing market is from recovery. He listed his northern Virginia home for sale last fall and already has slashed the asking price by $100,000, to $1.4 million. Before Christmas, he pulled the five-bedroom colonial off the market with plans to relist it later this year. He says he wants to live closer to Washington. "The commute is very hard," he says, "and the hours are very long."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- The Fairchild condominium development in lower Manhattan opened for sale in December 2008, just after the collapse of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings</span> rippled across the financial sector and paralyzed the Big Apple's real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gerard Longo, principal of Atlantic Walk Vestry, which developed the 21-unit building, saw just two sales in the first six months. It took cutting the asking prices by about 15% -- a three-bedroom unit that was to go on the market for $3.6 million sold for $3.1 million -- to generate activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, these days, Mr. Longo is upbeat, cheered by the return of buyers ready to spend Wall Street bonuses. Roughly half of last week's 30 appointments to view condos came from employees in the financial sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're more aggressively looking, and now we're starting to see the offers come in," he said. More than half of the 21 units are under contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While public outrage looms over Wall Street's 2009 bonuses, potentially record payouts expected in coming weeks, New York's real-estate community is outright giddy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local brokers said the money will help stabilize the nation's quirkiest sales market by boosting sales, particularly in the $2 million to $5 million range, and restoring confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a happier feeling," said Paul Purcell, co-founder of <span class="companylink">Charles Rutenberg Realty</span>. "Our leading indicator is the Street. . . . We're grabbing on to anything that is a positive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Statistics on residential sales in January and February won't be available for months, but anecdotal evidence supports the view that workers on Wall Street are window shopping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers said that visits to their Web sites have increased and foot traffic is rising at open houses. Appointments, which show more serious interest, particularly during the recent cold snap, also are up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, an employee from a big bank inked a contract in the $6 million range for a four-bedroom unit on Central Park West, said Jacky Teplitzky, managing director with Prudential Douglas Elliman, who considered the deal a good start to the new year and a good sign of more deals to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It shows a comeback," she said. "Four months ago, they didn't feel comfortable buying," she said. Now, however, "after they found out what their bonus was going to be they felt very comfortable proceeding with the purchase."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, at PS90, a Harlem elementary school converted into condos, a financial-services employee is expected to sign a contract for a two-bedroom penthouse with an asking price of $799,000 by Friday. The potential buyer declined to be interviewed. The expected deal shows how some secondary condo markets are feeling the ripples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York apartment sales have long been tied to the fortunes of Wall Street, as bankers, traders and money managers used a large portion of their bonuses to find new digs. And price tags often didn't matter. To prepare for a return to brisk sales, some agents are rehiring assistants laid off during the downturn, and marketing is being ramped up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while some brokers are hopeful that the pickup in interest will turn into solid sales, analysts aren't so sure. They see several factors that could keep sales down. First, thousands of jobs that were lost on Wall Street still haven't returned. So while the employees who are left will reap big bonuses, the total number of workers with big pay packages will be smaller, and some bonuses payments will be made in stock, not cash, limiting the amount available for real-estate purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, credit remains tough to secure, particularly at higher price points, and buyers are becoming more conservative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I wouldn't assume that these large bonuses are going directly back into real estate. That was an assumption that was made in a previous era," said Sofia Song, vice president of research for real-estate Web site StreetEasy.com. "This is a new economy and people are thinking differently and valuing things differently."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such conditions took a toll on the market's sky-high prices. Since peaking in the third quarter of 2008, co-op prices have fallen 13%, to a median of $622,250, while condos, which peaked the next quarter, have plunged 22%, to a median of $1.033 million, according to a fourth-quarter report by <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> and PropertyShark.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with many markets nationwide, falling prices sparked activity. Fourth-quarter closings soared nearly 50% from a year earlier. But much of that activity came in under $1 million, considered Manhattan's lower end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, brokers report increased interest in pricier units, as well as the new product planned during the heyday but now ready for quick sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, brokers report that this year's bonus crowd is skipping the flashiness. Prospective buyers aren't being overindulgent, and they aren't bragging about expected payouts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's sort of a whisper factor about it," said Pamela Liebman, Corcoran's chief executive. "In the go-go days, they would stretch to buy the biggest, most luxurious apartment they could find. Now, we have this era of hush-hush conservatism."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Snowmass Village, Colo. -- Roaming through her 10,000-square-foot, eight-bedroom vacation home, clad in a gray hooded sweatshirt, Karen Davidson said it was time for a change. "It's got everything but a post office," she said of her 10-acre property here, which in addition to the main house also has two guest houses, a former stable and two barns. "I just want to downsize."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Dec. 29 Ms. Davidson -- whose husband Bill Davidson, owner of the Detroit Pistons, died last March at age 86 -- put her property on the market. The asking price: $47 million, making the estate, called Stony Creek Ranch, one of the most expensive listings in the country, in a resort area that has been hard-hit by the housing bust. In 2006, four area homes priced at $20 million or more sold; in 2009, just one did. After more than a year on the market, the asking price of a $60 million home on 44 acres in West Buttermilk was cut earlier this month to $47.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents say there are tentative signs of life. Last summer New York money manager Lewis A. Sanders purchased a 10-bedroom contemporary and guest house on 4.5 acres in nearby Aspen for $43 million, believed by brokers to be the priciest residential U.S. sale in 2009. "It's more active now," says real-estate agent Joshua Saslove, whose firm Joshua &amp;Co. was on both sides of that deal. "Buyers and sellers are getting closer together."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Stony Creek Ranch, "this property is missing the acreage, and it's missing the views," says Craig Morris, of Morris &amp;Frywald <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>. "But to be so close to downtown Aspen and so close to skiing in Snowmass, and to have all those structures, all those bedrooms and all that privacy, that is very tough to come by."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Davidson calls her estate a "landmark" property and says she believes the $47 million asking price is fair. One of the few residential properties in the county that's allowed to have several structures, Stony Creek Ranch's buildings offer 16,000 square feet of living space; its white-trimmed red barn is a familiar sight on a two-lane road connecting Aspen and Snowmass Village. Larry Jones and Katie Grange, both of BJ Adams and Company, have the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite its square footage, most of the rooms in the main house are modestly sized. The decor is typical Rocky Mountain luxury -- radiant stone floors, warm-toned wood -- with an emphasis on animal-based accessories. Rooms are decorated with paintings of bison and cows, elk-antler chandeliers, mounted deer heads and upholstered cowhide chairs. The "bovine bathroom" has walls upholstered in black-and-white cowhide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Framed photos of various Pistons teams sit atop tables. In another photo, Mr. Davidson beams at an infant grandson ensconced in the bowl of the Stanley Cup, which his Tampa Bay Lightning won in 2004. (He sold the Lightning in 2008.) On the walls of the downstairs hallway, Ms. Davidson has hung several posters of movies in which one of her daughters, Elizabeth Reaser, has appeared; in the "Twilight" series, she plays Esme Cullen, the adoptive mother of the vampire hero Edward. Aspen trees and lilac bushes dot the property, which abuts 160 acres of common pasture land with views of Red Mountain in the distance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1996, Mr. Davidson (who was dating Ms. Davidson at the time) bought the property for $8.25 million from Wall Street trader Boyd Jefferies, now deceased, and his wife, Sharon. The Davidsons liked the property's potential as a compound for their growing families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property opened up another side of Mr. Davidson, says Arnie Kander, a longtime friend and the Pistons' strength and conditioning coach. In Detroit, Mr. Davidson, who made his fortune from glassmaker <span class="companylink">Guardian Industries Corp</span>., was always clean-shaven and dressed in his uniform of suits; in Aspen, he sported cowboy hats, blue jeans, plaid shirts and stubble. "He was in his element," says Mr. Kander.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, Stony Creek Ranch was the setting for sprawling family reunions over Thanksgivings and summer holidays. Now that she's alone, Ms. Davidson, 61, says she's looking for a smaller property in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has since assumed ownership of the Pistons -- "Thank God it's not baseball," she says -- but continues to leave the day-to-day management to Joe Dumars, the team's president of basketball operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a personal level, she said she's unsure what the future holds. "Since Bill passed away, we've had two new grandsons. There's a new generation," she said. "Life just continues."</p>

</div><div class="author">By M.P. McQueen </div><div>1102 words</div><div>14 January 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As buyers ease back into the battered real-estate market, they're often hitting a stumbling block: fibbing by home sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eager to unload their abodes, some sellers exaggerate the size of their lots or their houses. Others minimize their property-tax or utility bills, conveniently forget about pests, or play down flooding problems or noise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate experts say that while such misrepresentations aren't new, the tough market of the past few years has made buyers more wary, partly because they can't expect rising home prices to bail them out of costly mistakes. As a result, deals are taking longer, and more of them are falling apart as buyers find properties sometimes aren't all they're supposed to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 30 states have disclosure laws requiring sellers to tell prospective buyers and agents about leaky roofs and other problems, according to the National Association of Realtors. But there's often a gray area involving the disclosure of problems the seller may not know about, such as a long-ago flood or hidden mold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">States are also increasingly passing laws requiring homeowners to disclose environmental issues, such as the presence of radon gas, a contaminant linked to lung cancer, and underground fuel tanks. In California, the checklist of required disclosures is so long that a cottage industry has sprung up of firms that help sellers prepare the forms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the complexity of disclosure laws, it's not surprising that potential buyers don't hear about every problem in a house. Besides the issue of fibbing, sellers may genuinely not know about problems. And even if they do, the laws generally don't apply to bank-owned homes transferred in foreclosures, which now constitute a larger share of sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers need to do their own due diligence and not rely exclusively on what sellers and agents say. They should hire an independent home inspector or home-inspection engineer, one not referred by the seller -- and be aware that real-estate agents typically represent the seller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some of the common misrepresentations and white lies that buyers may hear as they shop for a house, according to real-estate experts and state regulators:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- "This house is on two acres." Disputes about property dimensions -- how many square feet in a house or condo, or its exact boundaries -- are common. Sometimes buyers don't learn the exact dimensions until the lender's appraisal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listing agents usually accept a seller's word on property dimensions, says Diane Saatchi, a senior vice president at Saunders &amp;Associates, a real-estate firm in Bridgehampton, N.Y. "We tell everyone to verify," she says. Smaller dimensions also can cause an appraisal to come in lower than the agreed-upon purchase price. Low appraisals are a leading cause of ruined deals in today's market. A properly worded appraisal contingency in the purchase contract would allow you to scuttle the deal or find other financing if the appraisal comes in low, says New York real-estate attorney Michael Xylas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- "We don't have pests." A basic home inspection generally doesn't include a peek inside walls or underground for termites and mold, which are among the top complaints. Inspections for mold and radon gas also generally aren't included; usually buyers must order these inspections separately. Other inside-the-wall problems include faulty wiring and old plumbing, which also may require specialists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Holtzman, a financial adviser at Legend Financial Advisors Inc. in Pittsburgh, says sellers of the 1901 house he bought in August 2006 said its electrical wiring was completely upgraded, yet an electrical inspection revealed only one of three floors had been totally upgraded. The seller then knocked $6,000 off the sales price before they went to contract so Mr. Holtzman, 35 years old, could pay for the necessary work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- "This place never floods." Even arid states such as Arizona and New Mexico have occasional flash floods, and water and drainage problems aren't always obvious. June Walbert, 52, a certified financial planner at <span class="companylink">USAA</span>, a financial-services company, says her San Antonio house received a clean bill of health from a home inspector before she bought it six years ago. But 10 days after she moved in, the sewer backed up, flooding the house, and she had to fork over $2,800 for repairs. "It was a rude surprise," says Ms. Walbert, who adds she asked her home inspector and the seller for compensation, but didn't get it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Richardson, outgoing president of the American Society of Home Inspectors, says a general home inspection wouldn't catch that unless the sewer line was visible from the basement or water backed up into sinks and tubs or toilets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- "Taxes and maintenance costs are low." Home buyers often gripe about tax and utilities bills that are higher than sellers said they were. Homeowner association and condo dues and assessments are also common complaints. Sometimes sellers simply underestimate the bills, or forget to include recent or expected increases, agents and brokers say. Taxes can also be deceptively low because of unrecorded improvements like decks and finished basements. Ask to see recent bills, and check with the tax assessor's office for up-to-date information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- "This is a quiet neighborhood." Sellers may play down distractions that could drive you crazy, such as barking dogs or idling buses. A charming park by day could be a teen hangout at night. Your best bet is to view a property at different times of the day. "I can't tell you how many times in my career buyers didn't go there in the night time, even though I told them to. You spend more time in the house at night than during the day," says Ms. Saatchi, the New York real-estate agent. Talk to neighbors and peruse the local newspapers and blogs to get a feel for a place, and check with police for crime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- "There's going to be a golf course, a pool and a party room." Builders of many developments that broke ground during the housing boom ran out of money before the project was completed. Many homeowner and condo associations also are strapped because of delinquencies and defaults. Some states require upfront disclosures about this, but you should also ask neighbors, not just sellers, about any promised facilities. Also, check titles to be sure that specific parking spaces, storage units or other facilities are included in a property sale.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">J-Lo and Marc Anthony Sell</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Angeles to Financier</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony have sold their home in Los Angeles's Bel-Air neighborhood for $7.5 million to hedge-fund manager Mark Spitznagel, noted for a hugely profitable bet against the market in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-bedroom, five-bath house was originally listed for $8.5 million in 2008. Billed as a French-style villa, the walled-and-gated 0.75-acre property includes a guest house, swimming pool, stream and garden with an arbor. The 1941 home has hand-distressed oak floors and several fireplaces. Ms. Lopez and Mr. Anthony bought the 7,357-square-foot house in 2005 through a trust for $6.25 million and redecorated. The deal with Mr. Spitznagel included $1.3 million for the furnishings. Brett Lawyer of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> was on both sides of the transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple is also in contract to buy a three-acre estate outside Los Angeles, in the Hidden Hills area of the San Fernando Valley. The property, with a $10 million asking price, has more than 17,000 square feet of living space, as well as a 20-seat theater and recording studio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Spitznagel, 38 years old, is the founder and chief investment officer of Santa Monica-based Universa Investments LP. His bet on market volatility through Universa's Black Swan funds resulted in triple-digit returns in 2008. Universa now has assets of $6 billion, up from $300 million in 2007, and is betting that inflation will surge. Mr. Spitznagel previously rented a house in Santa Monica and also has a summer home in Northport Point, Mich.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Mudd, who lost his job as chief executive of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> when the government took over the mortgage giant in 2008, has bought a 15,000-square-foot home in Greenwich, Conn., for $6.45 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stone-and-shingle home purchased by Mr. Mudd and his wife, Maura, was originally listed for $11.2 million in 2007, when it was built. On about two acres, the house has six bedrooms and three family rooms. Patte Nusbaum of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> had the listing, and Giselle Gibbs of Prudential Brad Hvolbeck Real Estate represented Mr. Mudd. He now heads the Manhattan private-equity and hedge-fund firm <span class="companylink">Fortress Investment Group</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom DeLonge, frontman for the pop punk band Blink-182, has cut the price on his San Diego-area home to just under $5 million, about 25% less than what he spent on the house, renovations and decor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The single-story house, first listed for $6.25 million in 2007, sits on 1.1 acres in a gated golf community of Rancho Santa Fe, about 25 miles north of San Diego. The guitarist and vocalist paid $5.5 million for the house in 2005 with his wife, Jennifer, an interior designer who redecorated the home. The five-bedroom, five-bath house of 6,500 square feet was built in 2003 and comes with a pool. The DeLonges are looking for a bigger property for their family, according to their agent, Laura Barry of Barry Estates.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>787 words</div><div>7 January 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment vacancies hit a 30-year high in the fourth quarter, and rents fell as landlords scrambled to retain existing tenants and attract new ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vacancy rate ended the year at 8%, the highest level since <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a New York research firm that tracks vacancies and rents in the top 79 U.S. markets, began its tally in 1980.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents fell 3% last year, according to Reis, led by declines in San Jose, Calif., Seattle, San Francisco and other cities that had brisk growth until the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York City, the vacancy rate improved by 0.1 percentage point for the second straight quarter, but around 60% of rental buildings dropped their rents in the fourth quarter from the previous quarter. Effective rents -- which include concessions such as one month of free rent -- fell 5.6% in New York last year, the worst since Reis began tracking the data in 1990.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords now must entice tenants to renew leases. "We'll shampoo their carpets. We'll paint accent walls. We'll add <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> cards," said Richard Campo, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Camden Property Trust</span>, a Houston-based real-estate investment trust that owns 63,000 units. He said the first half of 2010 should be "pretty ugly," but was optimistic the sector would pick up later in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few markets have been spared. During the fourth quarter, vacancies increased in 52 markets, while they improved in 17 and stayed flat in 10. Vacancies increased most sharply for the year in Tucson, Ariz.; Charlotte, N.C.; and Lexington, Ky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vacancies are tied to unemployment, because many would-be renters move in with family members or double up during a downturn. Apartments have been squeezed because younger workers, who are more likely to rent, have experienced the brunt of job losses during the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords were also hit last year by competition from a wave of new supply that hit the market. The 120,000 units that came onto the market last year, including some busted condo projects that had to be converted to rentals, represented the most new construction since 2003, according to Reis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of those developments had secured financing before credit markets seized up. The credit crunch has frozen most new development, which means that new apartment completions should fall by half in 2011. That's one potential silver lining for apartment owners: The limited new supply should give them the ability to boost rents quickly whenever job growth returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you are renting a place, now might be a good time to renegotiate that lease," said Victor Calanog, director of research for Reis, who added that the sector could see a recovery in the second half of the year, buoyed by either job growth or at least the perception that the economy was turning around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such oversupplied markets as Florida, Phoenix and Las Vegas are hurting, even though housing sales have picked up. "Landlords aren't benefiting because jobs aren't recovering," said Hessam Nadji, managing director at Marcus &amp;Millichap, a real-estate firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marcus &amp;Millichap is to release a separate report on Friday that forecasts a further 2% to 3% drop in apartment rents over the next year, most of which will be concentrated over the next six months. The report forecasts Washington, D.C., will be the healthiest rental market in 2010 for the second straight year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government efforts to prop up the housing market also threaten the apartment sector by making it easier for some renters to buy homes. Some landlords have reported a slight uptick in renters moving out to buy homes. Around 13% of Camden Property's move-outs last summer left to buy homes, up from 11% at the beginning of the year. But that is still roughly half of the rate seen during the housing boom, when mortgage standards were much looser. "During the housing boom days, you had people who weren't qualified to rent but could buy a half-million-dollar home," said Alexander Goldfarb, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Sandler O'Neill &amp;Partners LP</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to falling home prices and record low mortgage rates, it now costs less to own than it has in the past decade on a mortgage-payment-to-rent basis. But falling rents are expected to offset some of the recent improvement in affordability, making renting more attractive than owning in some markets.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes listed for sale declined in many U.S. cities in December as house shopping slowed for the holidays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts expect a jump in listings early this year. More foreclosed homes are expected to hit the market, and more sellers may plant for-sale signs, hoping to attract buyers seeking to qualify for a federal tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of available homes for sale in 27 major metropolitan areas at the end of December was down 4.8% from November, according to figures compiled by ZipRealty Inc., an Emeryville, Calif., real-estate brokerage firm. The data cover all single-family homes, condominiums and townhouses listed on local multiple-listing services in metro areas where the firm operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with the year-earlier month, the December inventory in the 27 metro areas was down 26%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories typically fall in December, with a holiday lull in house hunting. Zelman &amp;Associates, a research firm, says nationwide listings have declined an average of 11% in December compared with the prior month over the past 27 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Zip data don't cover New York City. Miller Samuel Inc., an appraisal firm there, reports there were 6,851 cooperative apartments and condominiums on the market in Manhattan at the end of December, down about 11% from November 2009 and 25% from December 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes listed for sale fell sharply in much of the country in 2009. Many people who don't have to sell a home have withdrawn from a weak market, awaiting signs of stronger demand. In addition, the number of foreclosed homes available for sale has dropped -- for now -- because efforts to prevent foreclosures through loan modifications have slowed the process. But an estimated 7.5 million households are behind on their mortgage payments or in the foreclosure process, and many of those homes eventually will hit the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This spring, many builders and other home sellers will be counting on buyers wanting to qualify for tax credits on purchases. To qualify, buyers must sign a purchase contract by the end of April and complete the transaction by the end of June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit is up to $8,000 for first-time home buyers and up to $6,500 for people who have owned a home for at least five consecutive years during the previous eight years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The credit is available for individual taxpayers with annual incomes of up to $145,000 or joint filers with incomes up to $245,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A major focus of both political parties is job creation. Underlying the discussion is a glorification of the merits of the "small business" at the expense of "big business." The commonly quoted statistic from the Small Business Administration (SBA) is that 65% of all new jobs are created by small businesses, defined as any business employing 500 people or fewer. Armed with that bias, and appealing to populist sentiment, there is growing support in Washington for tax reforms aimed at helping small businesses by cutting the taxes they pay or by offering them tax breaks for new hires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But here is what many people do not realize: 99.7% of all companies in America meet the SBA's definition of small business. This implies that the remaining 0.3% of American companies -- big business -- create 35% of all new jobs in this country. While cutting taxes in general is always a good idea for kindling economic vitality, ignoring the important role that big business plays in job creation is a short-sighted mistake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the aforementioned statistic, combined with the fact that most low-paying companies fit into the small business definition, it is not a stretch to conclude that large companies are disproportionately responsible for creating both higher paying and stable jobs. Small companies clearly create jobs, and occasionally these companies provide stable, long-term employment. But the large majority of jobs created by this group are both very low-paying and highly unlikely to be around for the long term. According to the SBA, 56% of all startups fail within their first four years of operation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is actually within large companies that an entrepreneur can find, already in existence, much of what it takes to insure a venture's success. This includes the capital required to fund startup costs, the marketing presence to create a near-instant reach to customers, and the standing required to gain trust of both vendors and customers. The two largest bond fund managers in the world, Pimco and Blackrock, were born inside of existing large companies -- Pacific Mutual Life and Blackstone, respectively -- and flourished under entrepreneurial leadership. Blackrock then went on grow immensely after it was sold to Mellon Bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Apple Computer</span>, a great example of a small company success, at one point was solely focused on computers. Yet in the past several years Apple's success has been driven by many new business lines including the iPod and iPhone. These product-line successes illustrate how a big company can entrepreneurially exploit its brand name, related technological expertise in the industry, access to capital, and sales and marketing reach. There is no doubt that if someone tried to launch either the iPhone or the iPod from his garage the results would not be what they have been for Apple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In my own career I've had a number of opportunities to build new businesses within existing big companies. In 1993, with financial backing from Nomura Securities, my partners and I built a commercial real estate finance business in which we applied securitization techniques to the market in a comprehensive way for the first time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At our peak we directly employed approximately 500 people around the country and indirectly many more. At Nomura we were credited with having inspired the creation of the Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS) market, which peaked in 2007 at $230 billion in new issue volume that year. As a consequence, we directly created thousands of high-paying jobs and helped to create many more jobs indirectly through the related services required to serve the new market (including legal, accounting, and rating agency and more).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently I joined CB Richard Ellis Investors, another large company, to build a new business line addressing the financing needs of the commercial real estate industry. My partners and I have been seeded with some capital from our parent company along with many other extraordinary benefits that have allowed us to jumpstart our operation in a challenging business environment. We've hired about a dozen people thus far and our plan calls for significant growth which, if we are successful, will lead to the creation of many new jobs. Perhaps, as was the case with Nomura, our success will inspire other companies to follow in our footsteps and many more jobs will be created.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Meena Thiruvengadam and Jeff Bater </div><div>339 words</div><div>6 January 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of housing-market activity plunged in November, largely reflecting a surge of home buyers in October racing to beat a deadline for a tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a separate report showed growing demand in November for a wide range of U.S. factory products, signaling the potential for stronger-than-expected growth in fourth-quarter gross domestic product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' index for pending sales of previously owned homes slid 16% to 96 in November, from an upwardly revised 114.3 in October, the industry group said Tuesday. Pending home sales fell across all regions of the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is uncertain how much demand was pulled forward by the original expiration date of the [first-time home buyers'] tax incentive, but today's report indicates that it was considerable," MFR Inc. chief U.S. economist Joshua Shapiro wrote to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite November's steep drop, the pending home sales index for the month was 15.5% higher than it was a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed that factory orders rose 1.1% to a seasonally adjusted $365.30 billion in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jump partly reflected higher oil prices. Orders for nondurable goods -- short-lived items and consumable goods, such as petroleum products -- climbed 1.8%. Orders for longer-lasting "durable" goods rose 0.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for nondurable goods "suggests more strength in . . . GDP than previously thought," said Zach Pandl, an economist at Nomura Securities in New York. Nomura boosted its estimate for fourth-quarter GDP to 3.6% from 3.3% after the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another key measure tracked by the report also showed strength. Nondefense capital-goods orders excluding airplanes surged 3.6%. That category is seen as a barometer for capital spending by U.S. businesses. The jump followed a 2.1% fall in October and a 2.9% increase in September.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(See Corrections &amp; Amplifications item below.)[U10379062375VVC]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A group of wealthy investors represented by a unit of <span class="companylink">HSBC Holdings PLC</span> has purchased a 90% stake in a Washington office building, in a further sign of the relative strength of the U.S. capital's office market and the dominant role foreign investors are playing as buyers of commercial property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">HSBC Alternative Investments Ltd</span>. paid $203.4 million in debt and equity for 1625 I St., a fully leased 85,000-square-foot building about two blocks from the White House. The deal values the property at about $587 a square foot, one of the highest prices paid per square foot in Washington during the past 12 months, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a New York real-estate research firm. The seller was <span class="companylink">Brookfield Properties Corp</span>., which will retain a 10% interest and management responsibility for the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the values of commercial real estate have fallen as much as 50% in some areas, the Washington office market has held up relatively well thanks to demand for space from government agencies and the Obama administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office vacancies in the metro area rose to 14.7% in the third quarter from about 11.9% a year ago, but the levels were still well below the national vacancy average of 19.4%, based on the major U.S. markets tracked by Property &amp; Portfolio Research, a unit of <span class="companylink">CoStar Group Inc</span>. In addition, the rents landlords are asking for in Washington's central business district aren't expected to experience as drastic a decline as in some markets in the U.S., according to PPR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Washington has been the most consistently performing market in the nation for a long time," said Ric Clark, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Brookfield Properties</span>, in an interview Monday. He said Brookfield is selling to shift capital from core assets into more opportunistic ventures like buying distressed property. "Any prudent asset manager doesn't buy, hold and die. They recycle capital," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> deal also is the latest in a number of high-profile acquisitions of commercial properties in the U.S. by non-U.S. investors. While there were few big deals of any kind in 2009, many of the notable transactions were driven by foreign buyers. In September, <span class="companylink">DekaBank Deutsche Girozentrale</span> paid $208 million for 1999 K St., a 12-story office building designed by Helmut Jahn and located in the central business district. And earlier this year <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> was on the opposite side of the table when it sold its office tower in New York to Israeli investor IDB Group for $330 million. Swedish construction group <span class="companylink">Skanska AB</span> also acquired a stalled office development near the White House for $85 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Clark said that Brookfield received five "strong offers" for the property as well as numerous other feelers. Of the five offers, three were from foreign investors. "There's a lot of capital around the world particularly in countries whose currencies have floated up versus the dollar," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brookfield purchased 1625 I St., known locally as Eye Street, in late 2003 for $157 million just as it was being completed by <span class="companylink">the Union Labor Life Insurance Co</span>. At that time, it was about 50% leased, Mr. Clark says. <span class="companylink">HSBC</span>'s purchase of the 90% stake values the property at about $226 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harry Heathcoat Amory, associate director of <span class="companylink">HSBC Alternative Investments Ltd</span>., said the deal was the group's first direct property acquisition in the U.S. since it added its real-estate fund-management business about three years ago. <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> Alternative invests in property on behalf of its private-banking clients, a majority of which are high net-worth individuals based in the Middle East, Asia and the U.K., though some also are in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Amory said <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> is looking at making more property acquisitions in Washington as well as other mature U.S. markets such as New York and Boston where new supply is constrained. "Those other markets are also places to look but Washington is the strongest office market in the U.S.," Mr. Amory said. "It's weathered the storm."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Amory said the deal, which included the assumption of about half the price in debt and the rest in equity, computed to a 7.5% capitalization rate, a measure of the property's income relative to acquisition price. Near the peak of the market, average cap rates were in the mid-5% range in the Washington area, according to Real Capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Knott, a senior analyst with Green Street Advisors, said Brookfield agreed to the deal earlier in 2009 before the national economy and Washington office market had begun to strengthen. "Things have moved in sellers' favor since the deal was struck," Mr. Knott said. "My guess is if they had to do it over again, they would require higher pricing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While foreign investors are interested in U.S. property, the volume of deals remains down sharply because of financing issues and the reluctance of most owners to sell when most markets are slumping. Last year, the total value of commercial properties sold to foreign investors and valued at $5 million or more fell to about $2 billion, down from $33.4 billion near the peak in 2007, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. The level was still a relatively small part of the $48.7 billion transactions completed overall in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany is among the leading foreign buyers of U.S. real estate while many Irish and Australian investors have become sellers, according to a report by <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign investors like to reduce risk by focusing on trophy buildings or occupying properties with strong architecture and long-term leases, said Andrew Weir, a managing director in Washington with Holliday Fenoglio Fowler. "There aren't a lot of deals that fit their parameters," Mr. Weir said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">HSBC</span>, which has been in discussions with Brookfield about the property for about 12 months, was advised in the transaction by Edge Fund, a Washington real-estate-investment adviser. As the talks continued and the market improved, Mr. Amory said it became increasingly aware of the opportunity it had to buy a property as market sentiment was improving but while competitors that would have pushed up pricing remained on the sidelines. "The timing was spot-on," Mr. Amory said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building's largest tenant is the Washington office of the Los Angeles-based law firm <span class="companylink">O'Melveny &amp; Myers</span>.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK—Options traders rallied around Hess and <span class="companylink">Millicom International Cellular</span> after research analysts expressed support for the companies' stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trading in Hess jumped to four times the normal level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That activity came after analysts at Raymond James upgraded their rating on the New York-based energy company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bulk of the trading took on a bullish tone, with investors picking up 26,000 "calls" that allow them to buy Hess shares and 2,000 "puts" that allow them to sell them, according to Trade Alert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in the session, one investor rolled out a bullish position from January to February contracts, selling January $65 calls and buying longer-dated February $65 calls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The February contracts are priced at $2.10 and make money if Hess shares rise above $67.10 before Feb. 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That level is about 6% above the closing price of $63.16 Monday, which represented a 4.4% gain on the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly thereafter, another investor rolled out a bullish position from January 2010 to January 2011, buying January $75 calls that expire early next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's activity followed a decision by Raymond James to upgrade the company's stock, to "strong buy" from "outperform."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said Hess was particularly well-positioned to take advantage of an increase in oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In <span class="companylink">Millicom International Cellular</span>, meanwhile, traders picked up 7,000 calls and 200 puts after analysts at <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> started coverage of the company with a "buy" rating, saying the current environment presented a "material buying opportunity" for investors who want to own stock in the telecommunications company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders in this case appeared to be extending bullish positions in <span class="companylink">Millicom International</span>, unwinding out of January $75 calls and buying longer-dated February $85 calls. Priced at $1.90, the latter contracts make money if Millicom's stock climbs above $86.90.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millicom shares closed the day at $78.06, gaining 5.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, traders kept a close eye on two real estate investment trusts, <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group</span> and <span class="companylink">Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust</span>, after stocks in the sector showed a bit of weakness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bulk of the action in <span class="companylink">Simon Property</span> took place early in the morning, when one investor pursued a bearish "put spread" in the company's April contracts. The investor bought April $75 puts and sold April $70 puts, paying about $1.60 for a position that makes money if <span class="companylink">Simon Property</span> shares dip below $73.40.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock closed at $78.92, down 1.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In <span class="companylink">Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust</span>, meanwhile, traders scooped up batches of April calls that allow them to buy the shares for $10. These traders could be speculating on gains or hedging a short position in the stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust</span> gained 2.7%, to close at $8.69.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was also noteworthy volume in <span class="companylink">Jackson Hewitt Tax Service</span>, a tax-preparation company based in New Jersey. Traders took mostly bearish positions in Jackson Hewitt, picking up 9,000 puts and 1,000 calls. Traders gravitated toward February $5 puts, as well as February $2.50 puts, hoping to protect a portfolio of Jackson Hewitt stock against declines or speculating on such moves taking place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock closed at $4.43, up three cents or 0.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jackson Hewitt recently announced that a bank that had previously provided financing for its refund-anticipated loan program wouldn't be able to deliver funding this year. That program allows Jackson Hewitt to extend loans to tax filers who anticipate a refund from the government.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. manufacturing activity expanded last month at its fastest pace in more than three years, as increasing orders prompted factories to step up production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management reported Monday that its purchasing-managers index rose to 55.9 in December, the highest level since April 2006. Any number over 50 indicates expansion. The ISM's new-orders index rose to its highest level in five years, and an increase in its employment index suggested that manufacturers were hiring back workers to keep up with rising demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surveys of purchasing managers in Asia and Europe similarly showed that the pace of manufacturing expansion quickened in December, offering further evidence of a global manufacturing rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factories around the world sharply cut production early last year, as demand dried up in response to the financial crisis. Now, with an influx of new orders, they are ramping production back up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's looking very good, and not just in the U.S.," said Zach Pandl, an economist with Nomura Securities in New York. "The economy has a lot of momentum right now -- it's a good sign that we're turning a corner."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Pandl cautioned that despite the rebound in manufacturing, there have been scant signs so far that firms are boosting either investment spending or hiring. Both will be necessary to ensure that the recovery in the economy that most economists believe started last year is able to sustain itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our customer base, they all seem to think that things are coming back," said Robert Mosey, owner of Moseys' Production Machinists in Anaheim, Calif., which makes components for aerospace, laser, medical-technology and oil-drilling equipment manufacturers. "Everyone's attitude is 2009 is past us now, we can look ahead and do business. It won't jump back up to 2008 levels, but we should start seeing some movement."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, even though U.S. manufacturing activity appears now to be growing quickly, the level of activity still is down sharply from where it was when the recession began. In November, according to the U.S. Federal Reserve, manufacturing production was 13.3% below its December 2007 level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In India, the <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> purchasing-managers index hit its highest level since May, and in China it rose to the highest level in 20 months. The data came as Asian countries considered dialing back fiscal-stimulus efforts and easy monetary policies adopted during the crisis. Australia's central bank was among the first to raise its key policy rate, and market watchers are waiting to see whether recovering nations such as India and South Korea will follow suit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The data are coming at a time when Asia has ultra-low interest rates, strong growth and very accommodating monetary policy," said Sean Darby, a strategist at <span class="companylink">Nomura International</span> in Hong Kong. "The better growth rates are, the greater the likelihood that inflation will be greater than the market is estimating."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchasing-managers indexes for Germany, Italy and France also rose. In Britain, the manufacturing sector expanded at its fastest pace in more than two years, indicating that the U.K. economy may have emerged from recession in the fourth quarter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. manufacturing sector finished 2009 on a high note, helped by improving production and ordering activity, according to data released Monday by the Institute for Supply Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, U.S. construction spending fell more than expected in November, pulled lower by the housing and commercial sectors as the recovering economy deals with high unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM's manufacturing purchasing managers' index rose to 55.9 last month from 53.6 in November. December's reading was above the 54.0 forecast by economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires. Readings above 50 indicate expanding activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The manufacturing sector grew for the fifth consecutive month in December as the PMI rose to 55.9, its highest reading since April 2006 when it registered 56," said Norbert Ore, who directs the survey for the ISM.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM's new-orders index increased to 65.5 last month from 60.3 in November, while the production index rose to 61.8 from 59.9. Both indexes suggest orders and output were increasing strongly in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factory employment also showed gradual improvement. The index stood at 52.0 in December, up from 50.8 in November. Economists expect total December payrolls to show little change when government data are released Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory index increased to 43.4 from 41.3 in November. Steep inventory drawdowns subtracted from real gross-domestic-product growth for most of the recession. Economists are expecting restocking to have added strongly to GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price pressures showed some uptick. The prices index increased to 61.5 in December from 55.0 in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S. construction sector, meanwhile, spending fell 0.6% in November from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $900.08 billion, the Commerce Department said Monday. Year over year, spending was down 13.2% from November 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires estimated outlays would decline 0.2% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending in November on residential construction projects fell 1.6% to $258.9 billion. Year over year, residential spending was 19% below the November 2008 level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial construction fell in November. Outlays on nonresidential projects decreased 0.2%. Spending dropped for hotels, office buildings, roads and schools. Year over year, spending for commercial construction was down 10.9%, as office vacancy rates have climbed with unemployment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp;Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than $1.4 trillion in commercial mortgages will come due by 2013, according to a Deutsche Bank analysis. An article about the real-estate market in Monday's Year-End Review of Markets &amp;Finance incorrectly gave the number as $1.4 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ January 05, 2010)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate, which sparked the global economic downturn in 2008, struggled to recover in 2009. But the path to a full return to health is littered with land mines that could send the sector spiraling downward again, possibly upending the nascent economic revival.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The past year's progress in the housing market has relied on government programs that are scheduled to be phased out. The commercial real-estate market is faced with huge amounts of unoccupied space and a deluge of defaults and foreclosures that are putting new stresses on banks and other financial institutions that already are on life support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outlook for 2010 is uncertain, at best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the bright side, housing markets stabilized in 2009 as the Federal Reserve's policies drove mortgage rates to 50-year lows for much of the spring and fall. Home prices posted six consecutive months of modest gains through October. The supply of foreclosed homes for sale has declined, in part the result of an ambitious program the Obama administration launched in February designed to keep at-risk borrowers in their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the underpinnings of the positive trends are fragile. The Fed brought down mortgage rates by committing to purchase up to $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities. That program, already extended once, is set to expire in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates could rise by a full percentage point after those purchases end, sapping any housing recovery, says Ronald Temple, portfolio manager at <span class="companylink">Lazard Asset Management</span>. He predicts that prices could fall by 15% to 20% if the program ends as planned in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales also have been supported by an $8,000 tax credit for first-time buyers. It, too, was set to expire in 2009 but was extended by Congress through the first half of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the foreclosure front, the government's battle is far from won. Loan servicers signed up 728,000 borrowers through November for trial loan modifications under the Obama program. Just 31,000 have received a permanent fix so far, or fewer than 5% of those eligible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the problem, the number of struggling homeowners is steadily mounting. One in seven households with mortgages was either in foreclosure or delinquent on payments at the end of September, the most recent data available from the Mortgage Bankers Association. Some owners are defaulting because they have lost their jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some are giving up their homes because the value has fallen below what they owe. Prices have fallen 29% from their July 2006 peak to October 2009, based on the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, which tracks home values in 20 cities. Nearly one in four mortgage holders owe more than their homes are worth, according to First American CoreLogic, leaving many potential "move up" buyers trapped in homes they can't sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You don't see the normal food chain working," says Ivy Zelman, chief executive of Zelman &amp;Associates, a housing-research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More foreclosures are expected next year as loan delinquencies climb. "It's really hard to envision a positive scenario of home prices going up when you've got this huge overhang," Lazard's Mr. Temple says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the pain is just beginning for commercial-property markets. Deal makers who took out huge loans to buy property during the boom often justified the sky-high prices they paid by assuming that rents and occupancy rates would keep rising. Instead, both have plummeted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take Midtown Manhattan, the most expensive office market in the U.S. The amount of available space has increased by 16 million square feet since the beginning of 2008, according to brokerage <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group Inc</span>. That is roughly equivalent to 16 empty 40-story office towers. Midtown building owners have dropped their asking rents by more than 30% since November 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As rents and property values fell and the extent to which banks are exposed to commercial-real-estate losses became increasingly clear, the government scrambled to contain the damage. The <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>., which has been seizing banks hurt by bad property loans, is offering private investors lucrative financing to buy and work out those loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the biggest such deal, Barry Sternlicht's <span class="companylink">Starwood Capital Group</span> last fall led a group of investors who paid $2.8 billion for a portfolio of 112 construction loans made by Chicago's Corus Bank with a face value of $5 billion. Small and midsize banks are particularly vulnerable to being dragged down by their real-estate portfolios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are going to be huge losses and a huge number of banks failing," says <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> commercial-real-estate analyst Richard Parkus. "This is just the tip of the iceberg."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than $1.4 billion in commercial mortgages will come due by 2013, and as much as 65% of those will have trouble getting refinanced, Mr. Parkus says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One major wild card in 2010: When will big investors get back into the market?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, institutions that control more than $100 billion in unspent capital earmarked for real-estate deals have been gun-shy, waiting for prices to drop and more distress to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research firm <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span> recorded only $42 billion in U.S. commercial-real-estate transactions through November 2009, compared with $136 billion in the same period in 2008 and $489 billion in 2007. But optimists believe that all that money on the sidelines will make for a quick rebound when investor sentiment improves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When confidence returns to the markets," says Dan Fasulo, Real Capital's head of research, "I think things are going to spiral upwards again very quickly."</p>

</div><div class="author">By William Boston  Special to the WSJ  </div><div>845 words</div><div>30 December 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Asia Edition)</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the credit crunch hit European property markets in 2008, speculative office development screeched to a halt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As office rent began to decline and vacancies rose over the past year, one hope remained for Europe's landlords: Almost no one was ready to sink money into a new office construction pit. The combined forces of a coming squeeze on office space and a robust economic recovery reviving demand would cause rents to rise again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nice theory. But chances are it won't play out that way. Europe's economic recovery isn't likely to be as strong as anticipated by financial markets. Unemployment is still rising, which is one of the factors that is driving vacancies for European office space close to 10%. And political meddling could have unexpected consequences for commercial property markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One example of that political monkey wrench is the outrage in London banking circles over the U.K. government's plan to impose a 50% income tax on discretionary bonuses greater than GBP 25,000 at all banks in the UK.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After word leaked out this week that James Dimon, chief executive of <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co</span>., spoke to Alistair Darling on Dec. 9 on the telephone about the tax, speculation emerged that Mr. Dimon threatened not to build a new European headquarters for the bank at Canary Wharf if the UK government moves ahead with the tax. <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> purchased the land in 2008 and is to decide this year whether to move forward with the GBP 1.5 billion ($2.4 billion) project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There were no threats made on the call and we have made no decisions on people or buildings based on the super-tax announcement," a <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> executive said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recovery theory goes like this: The development cycle will peak in 2010 in terms of new office completions. Then, in 2011, just as the economy gets under way, rising demand for office space from banks, multinational corporations, law firms and other tenants will run into a dearth of available space, driving rents higher again. Landlords, who now routinely offer long rent-free periods to lure tenants, will make money, and developers, spotting the opportunity, will start investing, banks will start lending, and the cycle will start again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, the likely amount of space that will hit the market is shrinking. Property consultants <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> estimates that as of the end of September, developers expected to complete about eight million square meters of new office space by the end of 2010, or 4.4% less space compared to developers' expectations at the end of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, Europe's office landscape is uneven. Expected office completions in Barcelona, a major office market in Spain, were down 31.5%, the steepest decline in Europe, according to CBRE data. The big exception was Milan, where expected new completions more than doubled. The report didn't explain the broad range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the credit crunch hit, developers delayed or cancelled many projects. As a result, CBRE expects a slight increase in completions next year but the number of new office completions will drop dramatically in 2011 when past projects are completed and few new projects are launched. Richard Holberton, a director on CBRE's European research team in London, says the lack of new development could produce "a possible fall in completions of around 40%, which would take [the decline in new completions] close to the levels that followed the early 1990s recession."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Holberton says that the reduced supply of new office space coming onto the market will "act as a general cushion against the worst effects of subdued demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In London, expected development completions in London in 2011 and 2012 will hit a 30-year low, broker Drivers Jonas LLP said in a note to clients. "This scarcity of premium product will drive rental growth," it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Up against this are vacancy rates. By the end of the September, vacancy rates in major European markets had risen to 9.7%, according to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. This year, European office markets experienced office oversupply of more than 500,000 square meters for the first time since 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given the fragile prospects on the demand side, vacancy levels are expected to rise further and significant amounts of space will leave rents under pressure," <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> said in the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the squeeze scenario emerges and new offices are in short supply, it is uncertain how much support the lack of supply will give to rents because tenant demand will remain sluggish as long as the economy is weak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With the speed and strength of economic recovery still uncertain, a more widespread recovery is tenant demand across different markets and grades of space could be a very gradual process," Mr. Holberton says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices stabilized in October, but the latest reading on the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index of home prices didn't dispel fears that prices are heading for a second dip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a separate Conference Board survey found that consumers turned more optimistic in December on their expectations that the economy will improve in the next six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller index of home prices for 20 cities increased a seasonally adjusted 0.4% from September, the fifth consecutive monthly increase. Before seasonal adjustment, the index was unchanged. Home prices are 7.3% lower than a year ago, a less-steep annual rate of decline than in previous months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index, which is closely watched because it tracks the sale of the same houses over time, showed home prices in October were at the same level as they were in the fall of 2003 and 29% below the peak in the second quarter of 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All in all, this report should be described as flat," David Blitzer, the chairman of the S&amp;P index committee, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After plummeting during the recession, home prices began to rise in the summer as a tax credit for first-time home buyers spurred sales. Existing home sales have been strong recently. But sales of newly built homes have been soft, evidence that the housing market remains shaky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The potential for another wave of foreclosures is clouding the housing outlook. One in four mortgages is greater than the market value of the underlying house, according to data from First American <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, said Patrick Newport, an IHS Global Insight economist. That could be a sign that more mortgages will head into foreclosure in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A stream of new foreclosures could flood the market and depress home prices. "Despite the recent positive reports on housing prices, we believe that prices have further to fall -- about another 5% to 10%," Mr. Newport wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists don't expect the winter months to bring substantial improvements in home prices, as demand is usually lower. But adjusted for that seasonal trend, home prices on the whole seem to be stabilizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, seasonally adjusted home prices increased in 11 of the 20 cities included in the Case-Shiller index. Prices have recovered, albeit modestly, in some areas where the housing boom was less pronounced. Areas that were hardest-hit when the housing market collapsed are taking longer to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year, house prices in Las Vegas, which have declined for 38 months, had taken the biggest hit; they are down 26.7%. Denver, meanwhile, has fared the best in the past 12 months. Prices there have fallen just 0.1% over the past year.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty  </div><div>889 words</div><div>30 December 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MIAMI -- The three-tower Icon Brickell condominium project is turning into a test case for how lenders should deal with distressed real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As they acquire control of more condo towers in Miami and other cities, banks face a dilemma: Should they sell whole buildings or large blocks of condos to big investors looking to acquire property on the cheap? Or sell condos one by one to individuals?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Selling in bulk brings cash in quickly and avoids the risk that prices will keep falling. But investors interested in bulk purchases insist on steep discounts from the prices buyers of single units would be expected to pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of Icon Brickell, which features a 100-yard-long pool on a deck with Japanese blueberry trees and whose early residents include the singer Jennifer Lopez, lenders led by <span class="companylink">HSBC Holdings PLC</span>, which effectively control the project since the developer ran into trouble over debt payments, have opted to sell more than 1,600 remaining condo units one by one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are counting on lots of demand from Latin Americans able to pay cash and eager for a prestigious address in Miami. And they believe they can get a better price selling "retail" to end users rather than "wholesale" to investors, even if it means they must hold and manage the properties longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The distress opportunities may not be as great as we all expected" because banks aren't being forced to sell huge quantities of condos in a hurry, said Manuel de Zarraga, executive managing director at <span class="companylink">Holliday Fenoglio Fowler LP</span>, which advises real-estate developers and investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is partly because federal regulators have given banks some slack: In October, regulators issued guidelines that let banks keep loans on their books as "performing" even if the values of the underlying properties have fallen below the loan amount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Icon Brickell will be competing for buyers with a group of investors led by <span class="companylink">Starwood Capital Group</span> that has become the largest player in the Miami condo market. That group in October bought control of 14 condo buildings in Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach, among other real estate, in a $2.77 billion purchase of construction loans made by Corus Bank of Chicago before regulators shut it down in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starwood has indicated that it isn't planning to dump its property back on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In many cases, the best option will indeed be to be a long-term hold as there were many attractive properties in the Corus portfolio," a Starwood spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the slow-sell strategy could backfire if prices keep falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Zalewski, the owner of Condo Vultures Realty LLC in Miami, said lenders would be better off arranging a sale of one or two of the three Icon Brickell towers to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He believes that it will take too long, perhaps several years, to sell the units to individual buyers. Meanwhile, the lenders will have to cover tax and maintenance costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo supply remains in a glut. In Miami-Dade County, 16,665 units were listed for sale at the end of November, or enough to last 18 months at the recent sales rate, according to Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell Inc., or EWM, a real-estate brokerage in Miami. Still, that is down from a peak of 24,905 listings in May 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a quarter of the condo listings are priced at $100,000 or less, a price category that barely existed three years ago. "Miami is 50% off," said Ron Shuffield, president of EWM. "It's just like having a sale at <span class="companylink">Macy's</span>."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If priced low enough, properties can move. Units at the 46-story building called Brickell on the River South sold out quickly after the developer, Groupe Pacific, cut prices last spring to a range of $175 to $225 per square foot from $325 a square foot in 2008, said Scott Wadler, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Holliday Fenoglio Fowler</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But whether sales will go quickly at more expensive buildings, such as the Icon Brickell, remains unclear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Icon Brickell is the marquee project of Related Group, a Miami condo developer. Related has invested about $1 billion in the three towers, including $15 million for giant statues of heads that resemble those on Easter Island, according to the closely held company's chairman, Jorge Perez. In a recent interview, Mr. Perez said loans secured by the three buildings total about $700 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the Icon Brickell was completed in 2008 and 2009. So far, 117 purchases have been completed, a Related spokesman said this month. The average price was cut in October to $419 per square foot from a peak of about $650. A typical two-bedroom unit now would cost about $550,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zalewski, of Condo Vultures, said prices at Icon Brickell will have to come down further if the units are to be sold quickly. He said the typical market price in the neighborhood is now $200 to $215 per square foot, and Icon's cachet can't support more than a 35% premium to that.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took a strong stomach, and a lot of luck, to get commercial real-estate deals done in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With lenders loath to extend credit and property values plummeting, transaction activity was scant. As of Monday, $48.8 billion of commercial-real-estate deals had closed, down from $150.8 billion in 2008 and $533.4 billion in 2007, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a New York real-estate-research firm. Real Capital counted transactions valued at $5 million and above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is a look back at a few of the more interesting transactions highlighted in past Deal of the Week columns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Sears Tower Name Game: The iconic Chicago building formerly known as the Sears Tower served up an example of just how far the pendulum has swung in the tenant's favor. In March, <span class="companylink">Willis Group Holdings Ltd</span>. announced that the name of North America's tallest building would be changed to the Willis Tower. The change was a condition of Willis signing a 15-year agreement to lease about 140,000 square feet of office space in the 3.8-million square-foot building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Willis made its request early on in its negotiations with the tower's owners, which include American Landmark Properties Ltd. of Skokie, Ill., and New York investors Joseph Chetrit and Joseph Moinian of the Moinian Group. With Willis eager to increase its North American brand awareness, the insurer made the "had-to-have" name requirement clear as far back as the summer of 2008 when it first toured the tower, said Kent Ilhardt, executive vice president of Cushman &amp;Wakefield of Illinois who represented Willis in the negotiations. Willis agreed to pay $14.50 a square foot annually, at the low end of typical rates in the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a better economy, Mr. Ilhardt said the London insurer mightn't have had much of a shot at getting such a good deal. "The timing was good," Mr. Ilhardt said. "The market was down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- A Not-So Big Easy Deal: The $42.1 million sale of a largely empty office tower, mall and parking garage next to New Orleans's Superdome almost didn't happen. Hertz Investment Group of Santa Monica, Calif., acquired the former Dominion Tower, New Orleans Centre Mall and a parking structure in 2003 for $36 million. After the buildings were damaged by Hurricane Katrina, Hertz struggled to sell or fill them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the state-appointed agency charged with running the Superdome let an option to buy the properties for $45 million lapse as it grappled with the deteriorating economy. It was the property's location near the Superdome that helped trump the financial crisis. Judah Hertz, chief executive of Hertz Investment Group, said he still is amazed the deal closed given the lack of buyers for office buildings nationwide. "It was a fluke," Mr. Hertz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A company wholly owned by the family of Tom Benson, owner of the National Football League's New Orleans Saints, purchased the complex in September and will lease most of the office building back to the state of Louisiana. The deal helped pave the way for Mr. Benson to sign the Saints to continue playing in the Superdome through 2025 and for New Orleans to host the Super Bowl in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- LA Buzz Off: One of the most watched office-sale sagas in Los Angeles has fizzled out. <span class="companylink">Macquarie Office Trust</span>, an Australian real-estate investment trust, took One California Plaza off the market last week, according to a person familiar with the property. The decision comes about one year after the 992,000-square-foot, glass-clad office building in the tony Bunker Hill neighborhood was put on the block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lukewarm response of bidders likely led in part to the decision. The 42-story building was in negotiations with at least one potential buyer for a price in the $220 million range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, the difficulty that potential buyers have had nationwide cobbling together financing also likely was a factor, some brokers said. A Macquarie spokesman declined to comment on the status of the building. But the move also may signal the company's confidence in a recovery. In a briefing with unit holders this month, Macquarie executives seemed to suggest a change in its U.S. asset strategy. This year, Adrian Taylor, Macquarie's chief executive, said the company would sell some U.S. assets. In the more recent briefing, the company said it planned to invest in the U.S. portfolio as the markets start to recover rather than to sell assets at a low point in the cycle, according to a document posted on the company's Web site.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Juliet Chung </div><div>1112 words</div><div>30 December 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>29</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TIBURON, Calif. -- Bay Area real estate has always demanded patience on the part of buyers. Many spend months scouring listings in hopes of finding "the one."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is Lidia Pringle. The 58-year-old former reporter for <span class="companylink">United Press International</span> became something of a legend in local real-estate circles for conducting one of the longest and most tenacious house hunts that brokers here can recall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've always given 110% to whatever it is I do," says Ms. Pringle. "If I'm looking for a dream house, of course I'm going to follow the same methodology."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors says the average buyer visits 10 to 12 homes before buying. Over 2 1/2 years, Ms. Pringle personally inspected 298 homes in Marin County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collecting flyers along the way, she amassed enough data to fill a meter-tall box. She looked at so many homes that real-estate brokers would sometimes ask for her opinion on new listings they hadn't yet seen themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House hunts have gotten lengthier as buyers have gotten choosier during the housing downturn. A recent survey of California home buyers by the California Association of Realtors found that buyers who used brokers, on average, spent 10.3 weeks searching for homes this year, compared to 8.7 weeks in 2008. National data show a similar pattern, with an average search time of 10 weeks during the second half of 2008 and early 2009, compared to eight weeks in 2005 and 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fussy buyers are called "tire kickers" or "fence sitters." Brokers love to hate them. "I don't know of any broker who doesn't have one," says Ron Phipps, president-elect of the National Association of Realtors. "The problem is, you don't know" who will be one. "There's no DNA for me to know that. There's no psychological profile."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, Cristiano Mancini estimates he looked at 200 apartments over three years in his quest for a charming one-bedroom in a prewar building for under $1 million. Several brokers gave up on him, he says, because he was interested in only a handful of streets and buildings. After a decade of renting, Mr. Mancini refused to settle for something other than what he wanted. "I believe in the feng shui and the spiritual part of it," says the public-relations director for fashion house Roberto Cavalli. He expects to close on an apartment in January. "When you step into the right place, you know," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Pringle, a reporter for decades, is highly methodical. She has file drawers filled with notes from years-old projects. She keeps spices in alphabetical order, and her record albums, from Abba to Warren Zevon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Pringle says she loved her home, a nearly 4,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style four-bedroom in Mill Valley that she and her husband, Doug, had built for $1.5 million in 1999. But her home office started to feel cramped when her husband, a real-estate developer,began working there, too. Local regulations prohibited adding on, and the Pringles had no spare space to convert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, sensing a softening in the market, Mr. Pringle suggested his wife start looking. "Little did I know that that would start a three-year saga," he says. He praises his wife's tenacity, but says that after the first year and a half, he began to wonder whether they could find better ways to spend their time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Pringle says prices surprised her at first. "It was amazing how little, in 2007, you could get" for $6 million, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She didn't make it easy for herself. She wanted the light colors and open spaces of Mediterranean-style homes like her own. But she also was interested in contemporaries, English Tudors and colonial-style homes. She compared every house to her own. Her broker, Lindy Emrich of Alain Pinel Realtors, directed her to home after home. Ms. Pringle found the properties wanting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A $5.25 million contemporary in Mill Valley was in great condition and had walls of windows,but its design felt uninviting and the road leading to it was too windy. A $4.9 million, 7,000-square-foot colonial in San Rafael looked impressive and had top-tier finishes, but it was too far from San Francisco and major supermarkets. Three homes in Tiburon -- a Tuscan-style five-bedroom, a brick colonial and a white contemporary -- were promising, but lacked two home offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crisscrossing Marin County in her red Mercedes, Ms. Pringle, who by now was seeing many homes on her own, rejected properties at a steady clip. Some were too small. Others didn't have enough light. Some had claustrophobic entryways. In one, the kitchen and garage were separated by three floors. The handful she liked either were already sold or were rejected by her husband.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Pringle was lucky in one way: Her search took so long that the housing bust really kicked in. She began noticing multiple price cuts on properties she'd seen earlier. "Why wouldn't you want to take advantage of this market?" she asks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the downturn that finally got Ms. Pringle what she wanted. A salmon-colored Tuscan-style home in Tiburon was originally priced at $9 million. Eventually, the owners cut the price by $2 million. After a series of offers and counteroffers, the Pringles closed on the home in September for $5.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Pringle found her dream home through a broker who took her to only one house. Ms. Emrich, the broker who had spent so many months working with her, wasn't part of the deal. "I have so many wonderful things in my life," says Ms. Emrich. "That is not one of them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, Ms. Pringle gave a tour of her new home, which sits off a private road in a hilly area. Marble and limestone clad a double-height entryway. In the cream-colored, step-down living room, 5 1/2-meter-tall windows look out on the Golden Gate Bridge and the San Francisco skyline. French doors open onto wrought-iron terraces. There's a pool, a theater and -- of course -- his-and-hers home offices. "It's like this house was made for us," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, almost. Ms. Pringle notes a general lack of shelving and that there's no built-in microwave.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher-End Homes Face the Price Pressure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the cheapest houses on the market may not get much cheaper, more-expensive homes still have further to fall, which will likely slow the broader housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home-price indexes for October are due on Tuesday morning. Economists estimate the index tracking prices in 20 major cities was down 7.7% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would mark the smallest year-over-year decline since November 2007, but would also leave prices slightly lower than in September, ending a four-month string of month-to-month improvements. That might cause some anxiety about the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite recent signs of a bottom, many observers expect home prices to fall an additional 10% before the bust ends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A pipeline clogged with future foreclosures is the most-cited reason for such forecasts. Another has to do with the shifting mix of home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far this year, between a third and half of all sales in any given month have been foreclosures and other "distressed" properties, which have mostly hit lower-priced homes, typically the most available to subprime borrowers. Distressed properties have kept home prices falling, even as the government tax credit has boosted sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worst of the subprime-mortgage defaults has likely passed, most analysts agree. That could explain why low-end homes are decreasing as a percentage of total foreclosures, while middle- and high-end homes are taking bigger shares, according to Zillow.com data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That shift suggests price declines will prove more pronounced in middle and higher-end housing brackets, which haven't yet fallen as far as the broader market. In San Francisco, high-end prices are down just 25% from their peak, compared with 39% for the broader regional market, according to Case-Shiller data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly payments for adjustable-rate mortgages, which helped many buyers afford more-expensive homes, could rise next year, either due to payment resets or rising interest rates. That trend threatens more defaults on higher-priced properties, which would weigh on prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further government aid could ease the sting, but may not be enough to offset market fundamentals -- it couldn't stop prices from falling this year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On his road to homeownership, Scott Leibfried has learned one thing: Expect the unexpected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leibfried and his wife had an offer accepted on a home, only to later find that foreclosure proceedings were about to begin on it. That's after they considered another home that was aesthetically pleasing but had major issues that came to light upon closer inspection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, they're trying to estimate the money they will need for closing costs and future expenses, hoping that they won't eat too much into their financial cushion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allan Glass, a Los Angeles real-estate agent who works with the couple, says "the biggest mistake buyers make is underestimating the costs" of buying a house and maintaining it over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners should have 1% of the purchase price of their home in savings for improvements and surprise expenses, he says. "That is the absolute minimum. It's better to have 2% to 3% socked away somewhere."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cushion often isn't easy for first-time home buyers to have. And there are many first-time buyers in the market now, due to affordable prices, low interest rates and a federal tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get a better handle on a house's condition, buyers should attend a home inspection and ask questions, says Bill Richardson, a home inspector in New Mexico and president of the American Society of Home Inspectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An inspector will estimate the age of major components, giving the home buyer a sense of when they will need replacing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look five years out and make a list of big-ticket home issues that you'll need to address, says Kelly Rogers, director of education for the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Orange County, based in Santa Ana, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fix small problems before they become large-scale projects. As soon as there's deterioration or cracking in the bathroom tile, for instance, address it, Mr. Richardson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimating monthly expenses can often trip up new home buyers as well. Homeowners have added expenses -- utility costs such as water, sewer and trash collection, property taxes, homeowners insurance and possible homeowners association dues. There also can be expenses unique to a location.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kelly Evans   </div><div>780 words</div><div>24 December 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy is showing more signs of recovery, but new data on housing and household income underscored concerns that the economy could lose momentum next year as the impact of government stimulus fades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes fell 11.3% in November to a seven-month low, the Commerce Department reported, as the government's tax credit for first-time buyers was originally set to expire. "The housing rebound has so far been largely supported by government programs, raising questions of sustainability as these programs come to an end next year," said <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> economist Anna Piretti.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The department also said U.S. personal income rose 0.4% last month, before inflation adjustment, boosted by government payments such as unemployment benefits -- though wage and salary payments to workers also showed an encouraging increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Growth may slow from its current pace," said Peter Newland, an economist with <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>, "but even as the government's fiscal boost fades, wages and salaries can provide underlying support for consumer spending." He added that it is unlikely the U.S. will get anything akin to a double-dip or another recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, inflation-adjusted consumer spending rose in November for the fifth time in the past six months -- the exception being September, after the federal "cash-for-clunkers" automobile trade-in program expired. A separate Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index, meanwhile, jumped 5.1 points in December to 72.5, as sentiment about both current conditions and the future rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in new-home sales to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 355,000 units followed a 7.4% increase the month before in the volatile measure, the Commerce Department said. Sales of newly built homes make up less than 15% of total home sales. Sales of previously occupied homes rose 7.4% in November to an annual rate of 6.54 million, the highest level in nearly three years, the National Association of Realtors said earlier this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales earlier this year were boosted by a tax credit of as much as $8,000 for first-time home buyers that had been set to expire Nov. 30, prompting some people to rush to complete their deals in anticipation of its expiration. Congress did, in the end, extend and expand the credit. But expectations that it would end boosted the existing-home sales measure for November, which reflects closing of deals, many made in September and October. The volume of existing-home sales was boosted by bargain-priced "distressed" sales such as foreclosures, which made up a third of all purchases last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, the new-home sales data largely reflect agreements to purchase homes, not completed deals, and thus reflect later decisions by home buyers. Data for earlier months reflected the rush to take advantage of the tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an encouraging sign, the number of unsold newly built homes for sale declined for the 31st month in a row, and is now down to seven months' supply, at the current sales pace. That was the lowest level in nearly three years and a marked improvement from the 12.4 months' supply in January. There are fewer unsold newly built homes on the market today than at any time since May 1971, according to IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department's new-home sales data are particularly volatile because they are drawn from a small sample. The government said it is 90% confident that actual sales were somewhere between down 0.3% and up 11.3% in November, an enormous range. As a result, the department says it takes four months to establish a trend in this measure. "A four-month moving average shows sales flattening out, after rising somewhat earlier this year," said IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, consumer spending gained 0.5% in November from the prior month, a rise of 0.2% after adjusting for inflation. That puts spending on track to grow at an inflation adjusted annual rate of 1.5% in the current fourth quarter after 2.8% growth in the third quarter, according to <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The personal-saving rate, which measures how much of after-tax income was unspent, held steady at 4.7% last month, the same as October, compared with near-zero levels during the boom. A price gauge closely watched by the Federal Reserve was unchanged, showing a 1.4% increase in prices last month compared with the prior year, roughly within the range the Fed considers to show price stability.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks rose slightly despite disappointing data on new-home sales, as gains in commodities drove energy and metals companies higher while the dollar fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.51 point to 10466.44. <span class="companylink">Alcoa</span> rose 1.3% and DuPont gained 1.1%. Merck fell 1.3% and <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> slid 1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.8%. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index edged up 0.2%, led by its materials and energy sectors. The energy sector's gains came as crude-oil futures soared following a bigger-than-expected drop in U.S. oil and fuel inventories. T</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar fell and Treasurys were mixed. The two-year note fell 1/32 to yield 0.926%, while the 10-year note rose 1/32 to yield 3.754%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The action came on particularly light volume heading into the Christmas holiday on Friday. Stock markets will close at 1 p.m. on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx, cautioned against reading too much into Wednesday's stock-market action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's definitely seasonality at play," Mr. Colas said. "At the very tail end of the year, people that want to show investments in stocks are buying stocks. On light volume, that demand will be what drives markets higher."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The small stock gains came despite the Commerce Department's report of an 11.3% tumble in sales of single-family homes for November, which pushed the seasonally adjusted annual rate to its lowest level since April. The plunge wiped out much of the gain made in the new-home market since the January bottom, and disappointed investors a day after they were cheered by a bigger-than-expected rise in existing-home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contrast between the existing-home sales and the new-home sales for November was due in part to the fact that new-home sales, unlike sales of existing homes, are recorded with the signing of a sales contract and not the closing. A big tax credit for first time buyers was due to expire at the end of November and caused concern in the housing sector. It was extended in November by Congress to next spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So here we're really seeing the impact that the new-home buyer tax credit had," said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial. "Hopefully we'll see them bounce back as the tax credit was reinstated."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Micron Technology</span> rose 6.2% after the company said late Tuesday it swung to a profit, helped by strong sales of memory processors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate-uniform maker <span class="companylink">Cintas</span> tumbled 11%. Its fiscal second-quarter results missed expectations as high unemployment cut into the need for uniforms.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- New-home sales plunged to their lowest level in seven months in November, a bigger-than-expected drop and a sign of a rocky housing-market recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the income of Americans in November gained by the largest amount in half a year, and consumer spending rose strongly, according to data indicating the economy might have picked up speed near the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new single-family homes decreased 11.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 355,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. The level was the lowest since 345,000 in April. The plunge wiped out much of the gain made in the new-home market since the January bottom. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had estimated a 1.2% drop to a 425,000 annual rate for November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The obvious culprit for the weakness is the previously scheduled expiration of the home-buyer tax credit," said Michael Feroli, an analyst at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span>. The credit was scheduled to expire at the end of November, though it was subsequently extended through the end of April 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That schedule may have pulled buyers into earlier months as they sought to have the purchase completed before the credit was to expire," Mr. Feroli said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said this motive should have had a more pronounced effect on November new-home sales than existing-home sales because new-home sales are recorded at the time of contract signing, earlier than existing-home sales, which are recorded at the time of contract closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts also blamed competition from the existing-home market. Home resales are up 44% over the past year as buyers vie to buy for foreclosed properties at a discount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"About one-third of existing-home sales are forced or distressed sales associated with foreclosures," said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics. "There are some tremendous bargains to be had, price-wise. This is generating tough competition for new-home sales."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report said new-home sales in October rose 1.8% to 400,000, revised from an originally reported 6.2% increase to 430,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year over year, November new-home sales were down 9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for a new home dropped in November, but not by much. It was down 1.9% to $217,400 from $221,600 in November 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a Commerce Department report Wednesday showed personal income increased 0.4% from October, and spending increased 0.5%. A key gauge of prices suggested inflation wasn't yet threatening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With income from wages and salaries growing again, it looks like the consumer will be able to keep spending," said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">October data were revised. Income that month rose 0.3% instead of increasing 0.2% as first estimated. Spending climbed 0.6% as opposed to rising 0.7%.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales surged to nearly a three-year high in November and prices steadied, but the sector's broader prospects for recovery appear uncertain, with tax incentives for buyers winding down and historically low interest rates unlikely to last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the U.S. Commerce Department revised down the economy's third-quarter growth rate to a lackluster 2.2% annualized rate, compared with the prior estimate of 2.8%, although economists said that could mean more robust growth in the current quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Although softer, the new estimate remained consistent with the view that the economy turned a corner in the summer months," said Michael Moran, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Daiwa Securities America</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing U.S. homes rose 7.4% in November from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.54 million units -- the highest rate since February 2007, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group's chief economist, Lawrence Yun, attributed the gain to "a rush of first-time buyers" not wanting to miss out on the government's tax credit of up to $8,000 that was initially set to expire at the end of the month. The credit for first-time buyers has since been extended through April 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales boost is helping the housing market work through its glut of inventory, which fell 1.3% in November to 3.52 million homes available for sale, or a 6.5 months' supply at the current sales pace, compared with a seven months' supply in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is also providing some support for home prices. The median sales price for an existing home last month was $172,600, down 4.3% from a year ago, a stark improvement from October's 7.6% decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, government stimulus accounted for a good part of the broader economy's growth during the third quarter, which was revised on Tuesday for a third time. Revisions tend to be volatile around turning points in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "cash for clunkers" program for car buyers helped boost spending on big-ticket durable goods by 20%, accounting for almost half the total gain in consumer spending, the biggest component of gross domestic product. Government spending, meanwhile, rose at a 2.6% annualized rate, helping offset larger declines in business investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A downward revision to inventory levels, however, suggested some fuel for growth in the current quarter, as firms slow their destocking and even start to order new merchandise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nothing in the big picture has changed, and we still expect better than 4% economic growth in the fourth quarter," said RDQ Economics in a client note.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. sales of previously owned homes surged in November amid tax relief and low borrowing costs, data showed Tuesday, in a positive sign for the U.S. economy's performance in the final quarter of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, a separate report showed the economy's recovery in the third quarter wasn't as strong as earlier thought as construction and inventory investments fell short of projections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales increased for the third consecutive month, rising by 7.4% to a 6.54 million annual rate from 6.09 million in October, the National Association of Realtors said. It was the highest level since February 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expected a 3.3% increase in sales during November to a rate of 6.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While credit conditions remain difficult and joblessness in the U.S. sits at 10%, an $8,000 tax incentive for first-time buyers, low borrowing costs and historically low prices are supporting home purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy, emerging from its worst recession since the Great Depression, expanded for the first time in more than a year between July and September 2009. But the Commerce Department said gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 2.2% in the third quarter, down from previous growth estimates of 2.8% and an originally reported 3.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new figure was below Wall Street forecasts. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires were expecting the GDP revision to show growth of 2.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing report Tuesday was another positive for the market, recovering from a big bust. Year-over-year, resales were 44.1% higher last month than the level in November 2008. October existing-home sales rose a revised 9.9%; originally, the NAR said sales surged 10.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average 30-year mortgage rate was 4.88% in November, down from 4.95% in October, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> data showed. The NAR reported the median price for an existing home last month was $172,600, down 4.3% from $180,300 in November 2008. The decline was the smallest since a 4.1% drop in November 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 6.54 million in overall U.S. resales, 33% were distressed, which includes foreclosures. That compares to a range of 45% to 50% in months during late 2008 and early 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, the third-quarter GDP numbers showed downward revisions to nonresidential fixed investment and to private inventory investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GDP breakdown also showed consumer spending rose a quarterly 2.8% in the third quarter, slightly down from the earlier estimate that spending had risen by 2.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, solid consumer spending and a sharp drop in stockpiles are expected to lift production and ensure continued expansion for the U.S. economy into 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong data out earlier this month indicated that GDP should grow by more in the final three months of the year compared to the July-September period.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New data on home sales and prices provided fresh signs of a stabilizing housing market, but a continuing flood of foreclosures and the eventual withdrawal of government life support threaten that trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said Tuesday that sales of existing homes rose 7.4% in November from October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.54 million units -- the highest rate since February 2007. Buoyed by a tax credit for buyers and low interest rates, sales were 44% above November 2008, when fears over bank failures were near their peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price last month was $172,600, up from $172,200 in October, the first monthly increase since June, the Realtors group said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the government Tuesday revised downward its earlier estimate of the economy's third-quarter growth rate to a lackluster annualized rate of 2.2% from the earlier estimate of 2.8%. Economists said details of the revisions, including signs that inventories were drawn down faster than previously believed, could mean more robust growth in the current quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Although softer, the new estimate remained consistent with the view that the economy turned a corner in the summer months," said Michael Moran, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Daiwa Securities America</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the recovery in the housing market is uneven. Prices have firmed up mainly for middle-class homes in areas with short commutes, where investors and first-time buyers are scrapping for bargains on foreclosed houses. But economists believe that prices of higher-end homes are likely to keep falling, because of a glut in supply and greater difficulty of getting loans for such properties. The markets for middle-class homes in much of California and the Washington, D.C., suburbs have shown big improvements in the past year, but much of Florida still suffers from a towering glut of condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate measure of home prices released Tuesday, the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>'s index, rose 0.6% in October from a month before. September's change was revised from flat to minus 0.4%. The FHFA index,which tracks the purchase price of homes backed by mortgages owned or guaranteed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, stands 10.8% below its April 2007 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another closely watched measure of home prices, the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, also is improving. Its national index rose in the third quarter of 2009 from the prior quarter, its second consecutive quarterly increase. That index is down about 28% from its peak in the second quarter of 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' chief economist, Lawrence Yun, attributed the rise in existing-home sales to "a rush of first-time buyers" afraid of missing out on the government's tax credit of up to $8,000, initially set to expire at the end of November. The tax credit has since been extended through April 2010 and expanded to include some people who already own houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers made up 51% of purchases in November, according to the Realtors. Sales of foreclosed and other "distressed" properties accounted for one-third of the purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales boost is helping the housing market work through its glut of unsold houses, whose number fell 1.3% in November from October to 3.52 million homes available for sale. That is 6.5 months' supply at the current sales pace, down from seven months in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, that inventory could balloon again in coming months as more foreclosures are completed. Banks' government-mandated efforts to rescue millions of distressed homeowners have slowed the flow of foreclosures hitting the market. But there remains a huge and growing backlog of homes likely to go through foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laurie Goodman, a senior managing director at Amherst Securities Group, predicted that around seven million homes on which mortgages are delinquent eventually would end up in the hands of banks or investors who own the mortage loans -- unless government policy changes. About 250,000 more home mortgages are becoming delinquent each month, she said. The problem isn't spread evenly across the country, but is concentrated largely in Arizona, California, Florida, Michigan and Nevada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospect of so many foreclosures may force politicians to take bolder action than they have so far, Ms. Goodman said. "From a public policy point of view, you can't have this number of units hit the market," she said. "So that argues that there will be one modification plan after another until a plan is successful."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of housing-market improvement could prove fleeting. "There has been less healing than meets the eye," said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Securities</span>, citing the temporary boost from first-time buyers and low mortgage rates. The Federal Reserve has pushed down mortgage rates by becoming the main buyer of securities backed by home loans. That Fed support is due to wind down in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revisions to the estimate of third-quarter economic growth, which was initially put at a much stronger 3.5%, reflect downwardly revised data on business investment and consumer spending on services. A downward revision to inventories, largely among manufacturers, suggested some fuel for growth in the current quarter, as firms slow their destocking and even start to order new merchandise. "Nothing in the big picture has changed, and we still expect better than 4% economic growth in the fourth quarter," said RDQ Economics in a client note.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Hannah Karp </div><div>1133 words</div><div>23 December 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most sports fans assume that once a stadium or arena is replaced by a newer model, the old house is immediately blown to smithereens in a pyrotechnics show that would make James Cameron proud. But many more than you think are still around. Some have historical value, while others are still bringing in funds to cash-strapped municipalities. Who knows, some may even be available to well-heeled holiday shoppers looking for a last-minute gift. Here are a few:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pontiac Silverdome</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pontiac, Mich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirty-five years after taxpayers spent $56 million to build it, this domed stadium, once home to the NFL's Detroit Lions and NBA's Pistons, was auctioned off last month for $583,000 to the highest bidder -- a developer from Toronto. After several lawsuits, the deal is expected to go through this month because the city can no longer afford to maintain it. The developer, Andreas Apostolopoulos, spent last week in Pontiac and says he is in discussions with Major League Soccer to bring a team to the Detroit area. He says the stadium might not be quite the bargain it appears, given the amount he'll have to invest to bring the facility up to speed. "There's a lot of work to do first," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reliant Astrodome,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houston</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world's first domed sports stadium, the Astrodome was nicknamed the "Eighth Wonder of the World" when it opened in 1965 to house baseball's Astros and football's Oilers. But since the Astros moved into Minute Maid Park (nee Enron Field) for the 2000 season, after the Oilers had already decamped for Tennessee for the 1997 season, the city has spent millions over the years on basic upkeep even though the dome has no major tenants. After plans fell through to convert the facility into a hotel and convention center, there are groups lobbying to turn it into everything from a movie studio to a planetarium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pyramid Arena</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Memphis, Tenn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opened in 1991, this 20,000-seat arena on the banks of the Mississippi -- one of the world's 10 largest pyramids -- housed the NBA's Memphis Grizzlies and the University of Memphis men's basketball team until both moved to the <span class="companylink">FedEx</span> Forum in 2004. Shelby County, which sold its half share in the arena to the City of Memphis this year, has considered refashioning the pyramid as a casino or an aquarium. A local congressman suggested opening a new branch of the Smithsonian Institution. Sporting-goods outfitter <span class="companylink">Bass Pro Shops</span> is renting the pyramid for $35,000 a month with plans to convert it into a megastore, but a spokesman says the company won't purchase the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former home of both the Redskins and baseball's second Senators franchise, which moved to Texas to become the Rangers after the 1971 season, the 48-year-old RFK hasn't been able to hook a new team for long despite $18.5 million in renovations for baseball's Nationals, which played there from 2005 through 2007. Critics pronounced it one of baseball's worst stadiums on account of its cramped quarters and awkward layout. The resident DC United soccer team hopes to have a new home by 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Balboa Stadium,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Diego</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built in 1914, this facility housed the Chargers during some of their winningest years from 1961 to 1966 and hosted three American Football League championship games during that period. Now owned by the city of San Diego and leased to the local school district, the stadium has fallen into such disrepair that many soccer players and runners fear injury on the worn-down track and torn-up turf. The city and district have said they can't afford renovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Olympic Stadium,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Montreal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designed for the 1976 Olympic Games by ambitious French architect Roger Taillibert, this structure -- which was part of a $1.5 billion project that was just paid off a few years ago -- has been plagued by problems since its inception, thanks to labor strikes, fires and a host of structural snafus. The inclined tower -- now the highest in the world -- wasn't finished in time for the Olympics, nor was the retractable roof, which proved unstable in high winds even when it was completed a decade later. Part of the roof collapsed before the Montreal auto show in 1999. Once home to baseball's Expos, a soccer team and the Canadian Football League's Montreal Alouettes, the stadium was used this month for a swine-flu-vaccination clinic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beijing National Stadium</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beijing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This stadium, built for about a half billion dollars before the 2008 Olympic Games and better known as the "Bird's Nest," was transformed into a snow park this month, much to the chagrin of environmentalists who say creating the artificial snow is a waste of water, especially given the continuing drought in the area. The snow festival is one of only a handful of events the stadium has hosted since the Olympics. With annual operating costs of roughly $10 million, the facility was placed under government management in August to curb financial losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alamodome,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Antonio</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opened in 1993, the nearly $200 million arena was forsaken seven years ago by the NBA's Spurs, fans of which complained of poor views from many seats in the designed-for-football stadium. (The Spurs now play in the <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span> Center). In 2005 the San Antonio City Council voted to spend close to $6.5 million to renovate the arena to lure a Major League Soccer franchise to the city, but it soon abandoned that plan, and the city hopes to someday draw an NFL team. One of Texas' least-utilized stadiums, it hosted the New Orleans Saints for a few games in 2005 when they were displaced by Hurricane Katrina. The stadium's bread and butter is playing host each year to college football's Alamo Bowl, which this season will feature Texas Tech against Michigan State.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Forum</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inglewood, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home of the Los Angeles Lakers and NHL's Kings until both moved to the Staples Center in 1999, this circular, $16 million arena was purchased by the Faithful Central Bible Church in 2000, though the church stopped holding regular services in the arena earlier this year. The church's Web site states "WE ARE AVAILABLE" for film shoots and rehearsal space; earlier this year the Lakers played a preseason game in the Forum to celebrate the team's 50th season in Los Angeles. The arena also has hosted big health clinics for low-income families.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks closed higher Tuesday as a bigger-than-expected rise in existing-home sales for November lifted <span class="companylink">Pulte Homes</span>, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> and a host of other companies connected to the housing market, while International Business Machines led strong gains in the technology sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Boeing</span> was one of the best performers, up 80 cents, or 1.5%, to $55.10, after the aerospace giant acquired Alenia North America's 50% stake in <span class="companylink">Global Aeronautica LLC</span>, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>'s latest move in its effort to get more control over the sprawling global supply chain that led to delays of its 787 Dreamliner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other big gainers on the Dow included <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, which rose 33 cents, or 1.1%, to 29.29, and IBM, which climbed 1.28, or 1%, to 129.93.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gains came as used-home sales for November were particularly strong. <span class="companylink">Pulte Homes</span> rose 44 cents, or 4.7%, to 9.86.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, George Feiger, chief executive at <span class="companylink">Contango Capital Advisors</span>, wasn't impressed with the existing-home-sales data. He pointed to still-languishing house prices and heavy volume in the foreclosure pipeline as worrying signs about the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The volume of sales doesn't say much to me," Mr. Feiger said. "You've had a massive collapse in home prices and, by any standards, these houses are cheap and they're going to get cheaper unfortunately if you look at the foreclosure pipeline."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">American International Group</span> climbed 2.99, or 11%, to 31.05 after Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter, that the insurer halted plans for an initial public offering of its Chartis property-casualty unit. CreditSights analyst Rob Haines said the move is a bullish indication that the company's ability to pay off the government bailout it received is "perhaps more on track" than it had been.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Justice Department said <span class="companylink">AMR Corp</span>.'s <span class="companylink">American Airlines</span> unit and <span class="companylink">British Airways PLC</span> need to make concessions to secure its approval for a planned extension of their Oneworld alliance. Still, AMR rose 50 cents, or 6.5%, to 8.14, while American depositary shares of <span class="companylink">British Airways</span> slipped 19 cents, or 0.6%, to 30.75, during a strong day for airline stocks. Other gainers in the sector included <span class="companylink">Delta Air Lines</span>, which increased 40 cents, or 3.5%, to 11.79, and UAL, which added 1.41, or 12%, to 12.93.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Jabil Circuit</span> swung to a fiscal first-quarter profit -- its second in a row -- on a large prior-year write-down and expanded margins in the latest quarter. The electronics-components maker also forecast second-quarter earnings and revenue above Wall Street's expectations. Its shares rallied 2.16, or 14%, to 17.18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Navistar International</span> swung to a fiscal fourth-quarter profit as the truck and engine maker posted fewer charges while saying its results were boosted by commercial truck volume and continued military sales. The company's shares gained 3.05, or 8.6%, to 38.56 as its reported quarterly earnings and revenue were better than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">Bucyrus International</span> continued to gain a day after the company announced its deal to purchase <span class="companylink">Terex</span>'s mining business. Longbow Research analyst Jonathan Hartzler raised his investment rating on Bucyrus to "buy" from "neutral" Tuesday, saying the deal expands Bucyrus's end market and geographic mix. Bucyrus rose 3.33, or 6%, to 59.17, on Nasdaq. <span class="companylink">Terex</span> rose 51 cents, or 2.4%, to 21.45.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jennifer Levitz </div><div>1210 words</div><div>18 December 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharaden Schneider's annual "Happy Hanukkah" letter has typically been chatty and upbeat. Sent to 100 friends and relatives, her dispatches have touched on son Jake's entry into law school, daughter Rachel's trip to Belize, and her own job marketing software in Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, she writes bluntly that her job "ended with the computer-software company and I became fully unemployed." At 62, Ms. Schneider is looking for work, but notes she is thankful she still has health insurance. In an interview, she says, "I certainly don't feel embarrassed about anything -- so many people are in the same boat."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Holiday letters, those typically peppy annual updates on family doings, are bringing tidings of a lot less joy. More hard knocks are creeping in as unemployment persists and the economy bumbles along. Laid-off holiday scribes are using the letters in their job hunts. Pink slips, the lousy housing market and tales of forsaken vacations have displaced some of the glad tidings of yesteryear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This year could be difficult for many people who dread writing or reading about hard times," says Janet Colbrunn, a retired elementary-school teacher who runs a Web site with tips on writing Christmas letters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, this season's letters may be more tolerable than they were in the boom years, when many mailings gloated about lives of conspicuous consumption. "Most of the letters end up being sort of a brag sheet," says Ann Burnett, director of North Dakota State University's Women and Gender Studies and a collector of holiday letters. "Everyone is doing all these wonderful things. Johnny is an A student and Jenny is a cheerleader who has lots of friends."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Kelly, a vice president at a car dealership in Falls Church, Va., has been writing his family's unpretentious Christmas letter for 10 years. This year's letter reports items large and small: He and his wife, Amy, have a new baby; Ms. Kelly "hit a deer with the truck."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In past years, Mr. Kelly glossed over work quickly to get right to news of the children. But a draft of this year's three-page dispatch soon to go out is full of sarcasm about sluggish car sales. "Well, this was just such a great year," Mr. Kelly writes in the letter. "I'm sure everyone still has their jobs and has received big Christmas bonuses. You may have heard rumors that I received a $100,000 pay cut, but we all know that's nonsense."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actually, it was a $106,000 pay cut, lowering his annual salary to $150,000, he says in an interview. He said his letter will say: "For God sake, buy a car!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some writers are looking for support, prayers or a job offer. "Hi! I hope you have a wonderful holiday," writes Bill Mayhew, a laid-off software manager in Natick, Mass. "If there was ever, in our lifetimes, a year when we need a little Christmas, this is surely it. . . . Please keep me in mind if you know of a Boston-area organization that can use entrepreneurial, business management, or technology management skills."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Off the page, he says: "I don't want to overburden the message of the Christmas card, but at this point, we really do need to help each other." His letter, which went to 50 friends, came after he sent out more than 100 resumes. Mr Mayhew, who is 57, says he is spending down his retirement savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's unclear exactly when the practice started, but mass-mailed Christmas letters became a big deal with the advent of home computing and easy photocopying. Ms. Burnett, the North Dakota professor, has gathered about 800 of them over the past 10 years. She believes more people are writing because "they are so busy flying from activity to activity and not making contact with friends, so there is this obligation people feel" to report what they've been doing over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some specimens in her collection are formatted like a newspaper, with names such as "Christmas Chronicle." Others list milestones in bullet points, such as: "-- Great-Grandma Joan went home with Jesus in October; -- John, Jr. bought a '96 Chevrolet pickup."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In her favorites, writers reflect appreciatively on the fleetingness of life. One, written by an elderly woman, says: "Some days I can hardly stand to stay in bed until dawn for fear that I might miss something."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, more letters began exhibiting a "busier than thou" message, Ms. Burnett says. One letter in her collection goes, "As if we were not busy enough in November" -- as a prelude to the news that the family acquired a St. Bernard that month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Colbrunn, the Internet adviser, recommends dispatches that balance bad news with "positive or amusing spin" and has authored such a specimen herself this year, entitled "A Fairy Tale Christmas 2009."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and her husband, Donn, a retired General Motors engineer, wrote: "We have devoted the past two years trying to sell our house in Michigan in order to live near most of our family in Ohio." They portray real events of 2009 through a mix of children's fables. They are Hansel and Gretel, seeking a home. The banks are the "Big Bad Wolves" who refused to lend enough to potential buyers after the "Wicked Witch" -- an appraiser -- undervalued their home because "the three pigs down the street had existing homes that had declined in value."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Bethesda, Md., Mayumi Okada's annual Christmas letter, now emailed to 80 people, used the newspaper motif, with headlines and stories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2007 edition carried an article about pounding "a new bamboo floor into the master bedroom. Looks Great!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2008 version described her new job at a consulting firm, where she had a "private office with a window," and was "enjoying . . . a good team, a nice client and a regular paycheck."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2009 edition included this headline: "Downsized."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Okada, who is 53 and job hunting after the consulting gig fizzled, writes that after a divorce, she's dating for the first time in 24 years. Her letter says: "What was I thinking? Here I am job searching -- that's hard enough! Why would I throw in dating? I forgot what an emotional basket-case you are as you try to date!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Struggles will also show up in Lisa Kelly's letter. In past years, Ms. Kelly, an associate dean at Feather River College in Quincy, Calif., wrote about family trips to Hawaii or national parks. This year, she says, "I can't brag about our summer vacation because there wasn't one."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The holiday letter she is now preparing says that if anyone is looking for her husband, Mike, he's 400 miles south in Los Angeles. Their marriage is fine, she says: Mr. Kelly had to leave home for a construction job and is living with her parents for the winter. "I wrote, 'If you want to find Mike, he's at mom and pop's.'"</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas-based memorabilia auctioneer Darren Julien says the future of his nostalgia-themed industry lies in Asia. So when the management of new Macau casino Ponte 16 paid US$420,000 last month for a collection of effects from late pop star Michael Jackson that he had auctioned off in New York, Mr. Julien delivered them in person.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Asia definitely has the most potential of any region in the memorabilia market," he says, after delivering a collection that includes a pair of diamond studded socks, a ragged costume from the "Thriller" video, and a white, diamond-soaked glove the late singer wore as he moonwalked across television screens in a 1983 Motown special. "We're really focused on developing this market right now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Precise figures for the size of the global market for memorabilia -- a rough term that includes autographs and artifacts from historical figures to modern celebrities, and whose buyers range from serious fans to even more serious investors -- are tough to come by. Insiders estimate around $50 million changes hands annually, depending on what comes to market, with so-called blue chip pieces -- items connected to global icons like Madonna or Charlie Chaplin, or historically important figures like Winston Churchill -- boosting sales in any given year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Asia, the market for memorabilia lags far behind that of the West, according to most in the industry. While in recent months wealthy Asian buyers have bid record sums to capture rare wines, prized art, sought-after stamps and more, the region's memorabilia market has yet to make the same sort of impact. The Asian outposts of major auction houses <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span>, Christies and Bonham's have no specialists on memorabilia in the region and refer questions on the market to their London, New York or Los Angeles offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, the desirability of memorabilia from Asia has yet to match the West. Notes jotted down by Bruce Lee or the signature of Emperor Hirohito -- sought after by enthusiasts of martial arts movies and by collectors of artifacts from World War II respectively -- are the exceptions to a paucity of interest in Asia-themed memorabilia. Sonny Yeung, chief executive of the Ponte 16 casino and a self-confessed Michael Jackson "super fan," says his firm "has no such plan" to collect items more directly linked to Asia the way it has with the U.S. pop star .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market in Asia is still quite young," says Geoff Anandappa, of London-based stamp and autograph broker Stanley Gibbons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it will grow quickly, he says, due to rising disposable income, improving access to auctions via the Internet, the more widespread use of credit cards, and increased exposure to Western media. On a recent visit to the region, he promoted to financial advisers the broker's investment products, which are backed by memorabilia. An average investment of about &lt;pound&gt;35,000, or $57,000, buys a portfolio of autographs and the like, which Stanley Gibbons commits to buy back after 10 years at a minimum guaranteed return of 5% per year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The demand for collectibles from Asia will drive the market in the rest of the world," says Mr. Anandappa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Anandappa and others in the collectibles industry say that memorabilia should be only a part of an investment portfolio. Most investors are also fans who like to display their investments in glass cases in their homes or offices, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest among Asian buyers has been growing, according to some memorabilia specialists. Matthew Paton, a spokesman for Christie's in London, says the venerable auction house has seen "a steady increase in Asian participation" at its South Kensington venue, which focuses in part on film memorabilia and posters. The proportion of winning bidders at the venue that come from Asia has almost doubled in the past two years, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Julien -- whose eponymous, 10-year old auction house has sold Marilyn Monroe's phonebook, Elvis Presley's microphone, and Bono's sunglasses -- says he first noticed a growing interest from Asia five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Japanese media would come to cover the bidding at our Vegas auctions, and clients from Asia would fly in to attend in person, whereas buyers in New York just phoned in their bids. The people from Asia really wanted to educate themselves about the market," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, up to 50% of those in attendance at Julien's U.S. auctions come from Asia, Mr. Julien adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether this interest will develop into a homegrown market for Asian memorabilia remains to be seen. Buyers from Asia are focused on memorabilia's investment potential, and that means they are more likely to buy the "blue chip" pieces that are desirable in a global market, says industry observers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm sure there are some Asian celebrities that are collectible," says Mr. Julien. "But what makes them worth more is if there is interest from Wall Street, London, Moscow and elsewhere."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Gwendolyn Bounds </div><div>288 words</div><div>16 December 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed "cash for caulkers" program aims to encourage homeowners to invest in things like caulking air leaks around windows, doors and in crawl spaces and basements, adding insulation in walls and attics, and installing more efficient heating and cooling equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such unsexy-sounding home improvements can be some of the most lucrative in terms of energy savings and make a home far more comfortable. The federal Energy Star program estimates homeowners can save up to 20% on heating and cooling costs just by sealing and insulating, or "weatherizing" against the elements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exactly how funds would be distributed and whether do-it-yourselfers could claim a piece of the action remain to be seen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under one proposed scenario, consumers would hire a professional "energy auditor" who evaluates where homes are most vulnerable to energy loss, said Adam Parker, president of Conservation Services Group Inc., which has been involved in discussions with the White House. Some tools of the trade: an infrared camera that produces images of warm and cold areas, and a fan contraption called a "blower door" that helps suss out air leaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These audits typically cost between $300 and $700, though aid often is available for low-income homeowners, and some utilities provide audits free. Afterward, the auditor would recommend a series of steps to improve the home's overall energy efficiency with caulk, insulation, updated windows and heating and cooling equipment. Key to the program's success or failure would be tracking and analyzing work so consumers don't fall victim to a rush of unskilled workers seeking to cash in.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Multifamily Drag on Housing Recovery</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-building is so far down it has nowhere to go but up -- but only to the second floor or so. High-rises will likely have to wait, as a recovery in multifamily construction will probably take even longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Census Bureau on Wednesday reports data on new housing starts in November. Economists estimate starts rose 7.7% from October to an annualized pace of 573,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weather improved in November from October, and Congress extended a tax credit for new homebuyers, buoying starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while new-home construction likely rebounded, it was still unusually slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November's estimated starts would be down 12.5% from a year ago and a universe away from the peak rate of 2.27 million units in January 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the industry remains shellshocked: the National Association of Home Builders said on Tuesday that its sentiment index fell in December to its lowest level since June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low mortgage rates and prices and government incentives have lifted demand, but not enough to match a lingering oversupply, which will worsen next year as more foreclosures hit the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oversupply of new single-family homes has dwindled. As of October, there were enough for 6.7 months of sales, only a little above the long-term average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Census Bureau doesn't track new multifamily unit inventories, but they are likely higher than single-family inventories. Rental vacancies are at a record high, and inventories of pre-owned condos and co-ops are well above long-term averages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Completions of apartment and condos are down 16% from two years ago, compared with a 54% decline for single-family completions, said National Multi Housing Council chief economist Mark Obrinsky, reflecting the slow reactions of multifamily builders to economic changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There will likely be payback: permits authorizing new multifamily projects were issued at an annualized rate of just 102,000 units in October, compared with the long-term average of 489,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IHS Global Insight estimates spending on single-family home construction will grow 32.6% in 2010. But multifamily construction will fall 47%, showing that while the worst may be over for home-building, multifamily starts will slow the recovery.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most major Asian markets ended lower Tuesday, with Chinese property and financial shares dragged down on renewed fears that Beijing may act to cool rising residential-property prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was caution a day after Abu Dhabi's move to provide $10 billion in financing to help Dubai cover its debts helped regional markets rebound, with investors also warily looking forward to the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting and a swathe of U.S. data this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ANZ senior economist Khoon Goh said investors will continue to keep a close watch on Dubai. "There is still a massive amount of debt that Dubai World needs to work off, and it is doubtful that Abu Dhabi will be willing to continue stumping up," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan's Nikkei Stock Average of 225 companies finished 0.2% lower at 10083.48, China's Shanghai Composite fell 0.9% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gave up 1.2%. India's Sensex fell 1.3% to close at 16877.16, dragged down by a sharp selloff in banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese property and banking stocks declined after China's State Council said that it would take steps to cool rapidly rising property prices in some cities and that it aims to improve supply of low-cost housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">China Vanke</span> lost 3.4% in Shenzhen and <span class="companylink">Poly Real Estate Group</span> gave up 3.4% in Shanghai, while <span class="companylink">Guangzhou R&amp;F Properties</span> shed 3.5% and Country Garden Holdings fell 4.8% in Hong Kong. Banks also dropped on worries about restrictions on credit flows to the property sector, with <span class="companylink">China Merchants Bank</span> falling 1% and <span class="companylink">China Construction Bank</span> losing 2.2% in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shipping stocks fell after the Baltic Dry Index extended losses from the previous day, with <span class="companylink">Nippon Yusen K.K</span>. falling 1.9% and <span class="companylink">Mitsui O.S.K</span>. Lines shedding 1.5% in Tokyo, STX Pan Ocean losing 1.2% in Seoul and <span class="companylink">China Cosco Holdings</span> dropping 2.3% in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Sydney, banks and resources stocks advanced. <span class="companylink">Australia &amp;New Zealand Banking Group</span> rose 1.3% and BHP Billiton gained 1.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate shares outperformed in Tokyo. Mizuho Investors Securities analyst Takahiko Kishi said the buying was due mainly to a Nikkei report that Secured Capital Japan, a leading real-estate fund, would buy the Pacific Century Place building in Tokyo's Marunouchi district for about 140 billion yen ($1.58 billion) this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Mitsui Fudosan</span> was up 2.1% and Mitsubishi Estate rose 2.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Mumbai, banks fell on fears of higher interest rates following a jump in November inflation and on concerns of weak quarterly results, dealers said. ICICI Bank fell 3%, while <span class="companylink">HDFC Bank</span> slipped 3.3%. <span class="companylink">State Bank of India</span> fell 3%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Mark Whitehouse </div><div>2247 words</div><div>16 December 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>16</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Palmdale, Calif. -- SCHOOLTEACHER Shana Richey misses the playroom she decorated with Glamour Girl decals for her daughters. Fireman Jay Fernandez misses the custom putting green he installed in his backyard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ever since they quit paying their mortgages and walked away from their homes, they've discovered that giving up on the American dream has its benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both now live on the 3100 block of Club Rancho Drive in Palmdale, where a terrible housing market lets them rent luxurious California homes -- one with a pool for the kids, the other with a golf-course view -- for a fraction of their former monthly payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's just a better life. It really is," says Ms. Richey. Before defaulting on her mortgage, she owed about $230,000 more than the home was worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People's increasing willingness to abandon their own piece of America illustrates a paradoxical change wrought by the housing bust: Even as it tarnishes the near-sacred image of home ownership, it might be clearing the way for an economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to a rare confluence of factors -- mortgages that far exceed home values and bargain-basement rents -- a growing number of U.S. families are concluding that the new American dream home is a rental.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some are leaving behind their homes and mortgages right away, while others are simply halting payments until the bank kicks them out. That's freeing up cash to use in other ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Richey's family of five used some of the money to buy season tickets to Disneyland, and plans to take a Carnival cruise to Mexico in March. Mr. Fernandez takes his girlfriend out to dinner more frequently. "We're saving lots of money," Ms. Richey says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S home-ownership rate has charted its biggest decline in more than two decades, falling to 67.6% as of September from a peak of 69.2% in 2004. And more renters are on the way: Credit firm Experian and consulting firm <span class="companylink">Oliver Wyman</span> forecast that "strategic defaults" by homeowners who can afford to pay are likely to exceed one million in 2009, more than four times 2007's level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stiffing the bank is bad for peoples' credit, and bad for banks. Swelling defaults could also mean more losses for taxpayers through bank bailouts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts at Deutsche Bank Securities expect 21 million U.S. households to end up owing more on their mortgages than their homes are worth by the end of 2010. If one in five of those households defaults, the losses to banks and investors could exceed $400 billion. As a proportion of the economy, that's roughly equivalent to the losses suffered in the savings-and-loan debacle of the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flip side of those losses, though, is massive debt relief that can help offset the pain of rising unemployment and put cash in consumers' pockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the 4.8 million U.S. households that data provider LPS Applied Analytics estimates haven't paid their mortgages in at least three months, the added cash flow could amount to about $5 billion a month -- an injection that in the long term could be worth more than the tax breaks in the Obama administration's economic-stimulus package.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a stealth stimulus," says Christopher Thornberg of Beacon Economics, a consulting firm specializing in real estate and the California economy. "The quicker these people shed their debts, the faster the economy is going to heal and move forward again."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the stigma of abandoning a mortgage wanes, the Obama administration could face an uphill battle in its effort to keep people in their homes by pressuring banks to cut their mortgage payments. Some analysts argue that's not always the right approach, particularly if it prevents people from shedding onerous debts and starting afresh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The effect of these programs is often to lead homeowners to make decisions that are not in their economic best interests," says Brent White, a law professor at the University of Arizona who has studied mortgage defaults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few places in the U.S. were better suited to attract true believers in home ownership than Palmdale. A farming community that expanded in the 1950s to accommodate the aerospace industry around nearby Edwards Air Force Base, the city more than doubled its population from 1990 to the present as it became the final frontier for Los Angeles-area workers looking to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About half of Palmdale's 147,000 residents endure a daily commute that can extend to two hours or more one way. In return, they get a homestead in a high-desert locale of haunting beauty, with Joshua trees dotting the landscape, and real-estate developments locked into a master grid of streets with anonymous names such as Avenue O-8 or Avenue M-4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People have come here to put roots in the ground and try to raise their families," says Rev. James Powell, who ministers to a congregation of 1,300 at the Palmdale United Methodist Church.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 3100 block of Club Rancho Drive, built by <span class="companylink">Beazer Homes</span> mostly in 2002, captures the essence of Palmdale's appeal. Winding along the southern edge of the Rancho Vista golf course just south of Avenue N-8, its spacious homes, verdant lawns and imported birch and sycamore trees exude a sense of middle-class tranquility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leslie Gowin, a real-estate agent, remembers how she and her family camped out for three days to get the home they wanted on Club Rancho. "The market was so hot," she recalls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Club Rancho became a solid community of owner-occupiers, many of whom stretched their finances to the limit. As of the end of 2007, total mortgage debt attached to the 13 houses on the block for which records are available had reached $4.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fast-forward to the end of 2009, and the picture changes radically. Thanks to a 50% drop in home prices, at least two owners on the block now owe between $60,000 and $160,000 more on their mortgages than their houses are worth. Four more homes have already passed through foreclosure into the hands of new owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the process, the block's total mortgage debt has fallen 37%, to $2.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of Club Rancho also has converted to rentals, a shift mirrored across Palmdale. Five homes on the 3100 block are now occupied by renters, up from only two in 2007. In the past six months, at least three families have moved into those rentals after walking away from other homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Richey, the teacher, arrived in Palmdale in 1999. In 2004, she and her husband, Timothy, bought a two-story home on Caspian Drive, near Avenue O-8, with a no-down-payment loan. They took pride in the amenities they installed: a powder room with granite countertops, a backyard pool and play area, and the purple-and-turquoise fantasy playroom upstairs for their three daughters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the value of the house plunged to less than $200,000 in 2009. Their $430,000 mortgage, with its $3,700 monthly payment, began to look more like an unwanted burden. By May, amid troubles getting tenants for two rental properties she also owned, Ms. Richey decided the time had come to cut a deal with America's Servicing Co., a unit of <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp;Co</span>. servicing the mortgage on the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After three months of wrangling, she says she finally received a modification approval. The new monthly payment: about $3,300, far more than she had hoped. A <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> spokesman confirmed the bank offered Ms. Richey a modification under the Obama administration's Making Home Affordable program, and said, "The Richeys turned down the lowest payment we could offer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Richey and her husband had already been working on Plan B -- exploring the neighborhood's "For Rent" signs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On one trip, they drove by the house at 3152 Club Rancho Drive. It was bigger than their house on Caspian, had a pool with three waterfalls, and boasted a cascading staircase that Ms. Richey says she could picture her daughters descending on prom night. The rent was $2,195 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation presented Ms. Richey with a quandary now facing more than 10 million U.S. homeowners who owe more on their mortgages than their houses are worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On one hand, walking away from her home would be easy. California is one of 10 states that largely prevent mortgage lenders from going after the other assets of borrowers who default. But she also had to consider the negatives. Her credit could be tarnished for years and, perhaps most importantly, she feared her friends and neighbors might ostracize her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was scary," she says, noting that people tended to keep such decisions to themselves for fear of being stigmatized. "It's still very hush-hush."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Sobelman, whose family of four lives across the street from Ms. Richey, at 3127 Club Rancho Drive, sees mortgages as a moral as well as financial obligation. He's still paying the mortgage on an investment property he owns nearby, despite the fact that the rent is about $1,000 a month short of covering his costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sobelman, 37, argues that people who choose to default are unfairly benefiting at the expense of taxpayers, who have put trillions of dollars at risk to bail out struggling banks. "All these people are gaming the system, and I'm paying for it," he says. "My kids are going to be paying it off."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sobelman has plenty of company. In a recent study of people who owe more on their mortgages than their houses are worth, economists Luigi Guiso, Paola Sapienza and Luigi Zingales found that about four out of five believe defaulting on a mortgage is morally wrong if one can afford to pay it. But they also found that the people become 82% more likely to say they'll default if they know someone else who defaulted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moral or not, the individuals who want to shed their mortgage debts are quickly transforming the Palmdale real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adam Robbins, who runs the local Realty World franchise and manages about 80 properties, says about 90% of his prospective tenants are people in Ms. Richey's situation. So he and other rental managers are loosening rules to accept people who have been through foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those are all good people," he says. "They just got bad loans or bought at the wrong time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Richey and her family made the move to Club Rancho Drive in August, when she was already several months behind on the mortgage. With Mr. Robbins's help, she recently sold the house on Caspian Drive for $195,000, money that the bank will accept to settle the $430,000 mortgage debt. She's also considering walking away from the mortgages on her two rental properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Showing a visitor the personal touches in her new home, including a $1,800 dining set she bought with some of her newly available income, she notes the advantages of being a renter rather than an owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You take a risk for the American dream," she says. "I don't have to worry about paying property tax, homeowners' insurance, the landscaping, cleaning the pool or any repairs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others on Ms. Richey's block have made similar moves. Mr. Fernandez, the firefighter, moved into 3139 in July, after stopping the $4,800 monthly payments on the home he owned around the corner on Champion Way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fernandez says he made four attempts to modify the larger of the two mortgages on his home, which add up to $423,000. Ultimately, he was offered a monthly payment that, together with back taxes, was higher than what he had been paying. Today he's working to partially reimburse his lenders, <span class="companylink">IndyMac Bank</span> (now OneWest Bank) and American First Credit Union, by selling the home, which he expects to fetch about $300,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for OneWest Bank said the bank "offered Mr. Fernandez the lowest payment possible under the [<span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>.] loan modification guidelines." A spokesman for American First said the company always seeks to help clients stay in their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With an income of about $8,300 a month and a rent of $2,200, Mr. Fernandez says he now has the wherewithal to do things he couldn't when he was stretching to pay the mortgage. He recently went to concerts by Rob Thomas and Mat Kearney. He also kept his black <span class="companylink">BMW</span> 6 Series coupe, which has payments of about $700 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't know if I'll buy another house again, because it's such a huge headache," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As cases like his become more prevalent, other people are paying attention. Joe Mayol, a local real-estate investor who owns the house at 3109, says that of the 15 houses he owns in the area, six are worth less than he owes on the mortgage -- a predicament that's tempting him to walk away. "The question is what will recover first," he says, "the price of the house, or your credit."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fairfield Residential LLC, one of the nation's largest apartment owners and developers, filed for bankruptcy Sunday, the latest casualty of the turmoil engulfing the U.S. real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fairfield, which has built some 64,000 apartments, condominiums and off-campus student-housing units throughout the country, failed amid an inability to refinance debt or sell investment properties. That left the private San Diego, Calif., company with a litany of near-term maturities on debts related to various development projects and other investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fairfield filed for Chapter 11 late Sunday afternoon in Delaware and listed assets of $958 million and liabilities of $834.9 million as of the end of September. In addition, Fairfield noted that many of its properties are worth less than their loan balances. That contributed toward putting Fairfield in violation of certain financial covenants with two main lenders: <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp;Co</span>.'s <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> and <span class="companylink">Capmark Financial Group Inc</span>., the big real-estate lender that recently filed for bankruptcy itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to development, Fairfield also buys and sells real-estate assets, including the Milano in Torrance, Calif., and a sale of the Castlegate apartment complex in the Washington, D.C., suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It acquired $7 billion of apartments over the past seven years, and has sold more than $12 billion of real estate since 1997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bankruptcy is also a blow to the California State Teacher's Retirement System and a subsidiary of <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi Corp</span>., both of which invested in Fairfield over the years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most major Asian markets ended lower Tuesday, with Chinese property and financial shares dragged down on renewed fears Beijing may act to cool rising residential property prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was caution a day after Abu Dhabi's move to provide $10 billion in financing to help Dubai cover its debts helped regional markets rebound, with investors also warily looking forward to the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting and a batch of U.S. data this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ANZ senior economist Khoon Goh said investors will continue to keep a close watch on Dubai as its debt burden hasn't completely eased off. "There is still a massive amount of debt that <span class="companylink">Dubai World</span> needs to work off, and it is doubtful that Abu Dhabi will be willing to continue stumping up," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan's Nikkei 225 Average finished 0.2% lower at 10083.48, China's Shanghai Composite fell 0.9% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gave up 1.2%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up two points in screen trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese property and banking stocks declined after China's State Council said it would take steps to cool rapidly rising property prices in some cities and that it aims to improve supply of low-cost housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">China Vanke</span> lost 3.4% in Shenzhen and <span class="companylink">Poly Real Estate Group</span> gave up 3.4% in Shanghai, while <span class="companylink">Guangzhou R&amp;F Properties</span> shed 3.5% and <span class="companylink">Country Garden Holdings</span> fell 4.8% in Hong Kong.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're stuck in a range now and people aren't doing much at all," said <span class="companylink">UBS</span> head of sales George Kanaan in Sydney. "The Dubai bailout was fine, but it's not going to generate sustained buying."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate shares outperformed in Tokyo. Mizuho Investors Securities analyst Takahiko Kishi said the buying was due mainly to a Nikkei report that Secured Capital Japan, a leading real estate fund, would buy the Pacific Century Place building in Tokyo's Marunouchi district for about 140 billion yen ($1.58 billion) this month in the biggest domestic real estate transaction since the financial crisis began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The real estate investment market had totally cooled down, but the report spurs hopes that it may pick up again," Mr. Kishi said. <span class="companylink">Mitsui Fudosan</span> was up 2.1% and Mitsubishi Estate rose 2.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil refiners declined in Seoul after crude prices fell Monday, with SK Energy dropping 0.9%.

</div><div class="author">By Bobby White </div><div>1110 words</div><div>10 December 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A19B</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EAST PALO ALTO, Calif. -- A wave of robberies and burglaries is hitting East Palo Alto, threatening to reverse the city's recent period of stabilization. One reason behind the crime surge is the financial troubles of real-estate firm Page Mill, say locals, law enforcement and other officials of the town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Page Mill Properties LLC, which began snapping up local apartments in 2006, became the city's biggest rental-unit landlord and attempted to transform the town by redeveloping properties into higher-end condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in September, Page Mill defaulted on a $240 million loan from <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp;Co</span>.'s <span class="companylink">Wachovia Bank</span> and closed its East Palo Alto offices, leaving its properties there largely untended. Since then, some residents say they have seen more vandalism and loitering around their buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There has definitely been an alarming number of robberies and burglaries over the last few months," says Ronald Davis, East Palo Alto's police chief. "Some of the responsibility has to go to Page Mill," he says, citing an environment where crime and blight could fester created by Page Mill's abandoning its properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent day, the consequences of Page Mill's departure were evident at some of its properties. At apartments on Woodlawn Avenue and Cooley Avenue, broken fences and uncut grass abounded. Discarded leaflets, broken bottles and loose paper littered the parking lot of 5 Newell Court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Money manager David Taran, who runs Page Mill, declined to comment. Sam Singer, a Page Mill spokesman, says the company was stymied by the downturn, which devalued its properties so the firm couldn't easily renegotiate its loan with <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>. He says no one wants to see East Palo Alto's neighborhoods revert to their troubled past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Page Mill owned 1,800 rental units in the city of 32,000 people, or about half the rental stock, according to city officials. Now a county court has placed Page Mill's apartments in receivership and appointed a third-party firm to oversee them, though city officials say many of the units are less supervised than in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Wald, who operates a realty-advisory firm in Pacific Palisades that is now temporarily overseeing Page Mill's East Palo Alto properties, declined to comment on Page Mill's actions before his appointment as receiver. Mr. Wald says he is working closely with the East Palo Alto Police Department to coordinate security at the properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Private security at the properties has been increased, and overall I believe that security at the properties has improved," says Mr. Wald.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The repercussions from Page Mill's loan default on East Palo Alto highlight the unexpected impacts rippling out from the recession and the credit crunch. In the aftermath, East Palo Alto -- a blue-collar town that had the nation's highest murder rate per capita in 1992, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation -- appears headed toward another violent chapter after a period of stabilization in the past few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all of East Palo Alto's recent difficulties can be traced to Page Mill. With the city's unemployment rate at 20.7% in September compared with 17% in Oakland and 9.7% in San Francisco, East Palo Alto is clearly hurting from the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, robberies in East Palo Alto soared 140% in September from a year ago, according to police records. That increase continued in October, when robberies jumped 44% and burglaries swelled 73% from a year ago. The rise came even as East Palo Alto's total crime rate fell 7% in September and 2% in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, robberies and burglaries have declined in other Bay Area towns. In Oakland, burglaries decreased 36% in September and fell 20% in October compared with a year earlier, while robberies rose 6% in September but dropped 10% in October from a year ago, according to city records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Lund, a local housing advocate, says one Page Mill-owned 60-unit apartment complex on Manhattan Avenue has a 30% vacancy rate. Page Mill's Mr. Singer acknowledged that the vacancy rate in the complex had risen since the company pulled out of East Palo Alto, but says he doesn't have exact figures. He added that vacancy rates across Page Mill's properties in the city are now around 20%, down from 30% before Page Mill bought the apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virginia Savalli, who lives in a four-unit apartment building that Page Mill acquired last year, says the changes in the neighborhood are striking. A nine-year resident of East Palo Alto, she says she had noticed less blight around the city in the past few years. After Page Mill shut its East Palo Alto management offices and fired its maintenance workers, however, blight around the properties began to creep back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, Page Mill's management became less responsive to maintenance requests, says Ms. Savalli, who is unemployed. A month later, she says she complained about rat droppings in the garage -- with no response. In October, someone broke into one of her neighboring unoccupied units. Mr. Singer says Page Mill responded to maintenance requests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation is a turnabout from Page Mill's move into the city in 2006. At the time, the company, flush with a $100 million investment from the <span class="companylink">California Public Employees' Retirement System</span> and a $240 million loan from <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span>, began buying up East Palo Alto real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Page Mill put up security cameras and removed bushes and shrubs that hid drug dealing and other illegal activity. In 2007, East Palo Alto's robberies fell 45% and burglaries plunged 23% from a year earlier, according to the FBI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some residents complained about the company's steep rent increases, says the Stanford Community Law Clinic, a legal aid clinic that sued Page Mill on behalf of tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, city legislators in December 2007 placed a six-month moratorium on rent increases of more than 3%. After Page Mill challenged the moratorium in court and won, the city attempted to permanently stop the increases by drafting a ballot measure. Page Mill sued again and stopped the city from putting the measure before voters. East Palo Alto Mayor Ruben Abrica said: "Page Mill tried to wear us down. They filed so many lawsuits and took a completely adversarial stance." Mr. Wald, the receiver, is negotiating with lawyers from the city and Page Mill to try to settle the claims.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>2082 words</div><div>9 December 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>16</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scottsdale, Ariz. -- FOUR YEARS after the collapse of the U.S. housing bubble, flipping homes is back in fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jon Mirmelli, a Phoenix real-estate investor, learned late in the morning of Sept. 28 that a never-occupied custom house on the northern fringes of this Phoenix suburb was going up for auction around noon the same day. The six-bedroom home, built on a 1.2-hectare desert plot, has a kitchen with two dishwashers, four ovens, "antibacterial" copper sinks, and a master "spa" bathroom with space for a flat-screen TV visible from the tub.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The minimum bid, as set by a unit of <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>., which had a $1.3 million mortgage on the home, was $379,900. After several minutes of bidding among investors and their representatives, some wearing shorts and flip-flops, Mr. Mirmelli won the home for $486,300. A week later, he agreed to sell it for $690,000 to a woman who moved in this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the housing boom, millions of Americans tried to make money by buying and then quickly reselling new houses and condominiums. That kind of flipping stopped several years ago as home sales stalled amid a surge in foreclosures and curtailed lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, a different breed of flipper is proliferating: one who seeks bargains at foreclosure auctions. Unlike the boom-time flippers, the latest generation needs cold cash, lots of local-market knowledge and strong nerves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors compete mostly with other full-time professionals who monitor foreclosure auctions at county courthouses across the country. The bidders often haven't had a chance to inspect the property or determine whether it's occupied by tenants, who may be hard to evict.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes "you have half an hour to make a half-million-dollar decision," says Damon Lines, an executive at PostedProperties.com, a Phoenix firm that provides information to foreclosure investors and bids on their behalf. "That's something most people can't or aren't willing to do."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the states where home prices have fallen the most, many local real-estate markets are dominated by foreclosed property, dragging down the value of neighboring homes. <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> estimates that banks and mortgage investors have 639,000 foreclosed homes for sale across the U.S., largely concentrated in Florida, California, Arizona and Nevada. That's equivalent to more than 10% of expected U.S. home sales this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flippers swoop in at public auctions of foreclosed homes, known as trustee or sheriff sales. In many states, the lender sets the minimum bid, and takes possession of the property only if no one bids more. In the past, the minimum generally was about equal to the mortgage balance due. But in today's market, in which many home values have dropped far below the loan balance, lenders wouldn't attract investors if they set the minimum at that level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So lenders, or the loan-servicing firms that represent banks and investors, are increasingly likely to set the minimum much lower. Their goal is to tempt others to buy the house and spare banks the headaches and costs that come with taking possession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sean O'Toole, chief executive officer of ForeclosureRadar.com, a research firm, estimates that in November about 21% of homes sold in trustee sales in California went to investors rather than to a foreclosing lender, up from 6% a year earlier. The trend is similar in some other areas with high foreclosure rates, including Phoenix and Miami.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The advantage of such an outcome for the bank is that it gets money for the property right away, even if it isn't enough to cover the loan balance due. The bank doesn't need to make repairs to the home, cover the taxes and insurance, or pay real-estate-agent commissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risk for banks is that if they set the minimum bid too low, the home might end up selling for much less than they could reap if they took ownership of it and sold it themselves. But with some 7.5 million U.S. households behind on their mortgage payments or in foreclosure, many lenders are overwhelmed. They're negotiating with distressed borrowers and figuring out how to sell the growing supply of foreclosed homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The banks are so screwed up," says Mr. Mirmelli, the Phoenix investor, that they don't always have a clear idea of the value of the property they are foreclosing on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help them set the minimum bid, banks often consult with local real-estate agents and use software that estimates housing values. <span class="companylink">American Home Mortgage Servicing Inc</span>., which collects payments and handles foreclosures on behalf of banks and loan investors, uses a formula designed to "achieve a fair value for the property and induce third-party bidders," says Christine Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the Coppell, Texas-based firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American Home starts with a broker's estimate and subtracts the expected costs of taking ownership of the house and selling it. The minimum bid is above the net proceeds American Homes believes it could get by acquiring and selling the property itself, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside the Maricopa County court building in downtown Phoenix, trustees, companies that are hired to handle foreclosure auctions, offer as many as 600 or 700 houses every weekday. A typical auction lasts only a few minutes. On a recent afternoon, a few dozen bidders and onlookers were clustered around a trustee employee seated on a lawn chair conducting auctions. He kept track of the bids on a laptop computer perched on one knee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the bidders are regulars at the sale, bidding for themselves or on behalf of investor clients. "We're all kind of like a little dysfunctional family," says Steve Mutsaers, a representative of PostedProperties, who was wearing black sunglasses, a white polo shirt and gray plaid shorts. During the summer, Mr. Mutsaers says, he wears a sombrero to cope with temperatures well above 38 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who attend trustee sales here and in other foreclosure hot spots around the nation say the auctions have recently been attracting more bidders. "Properties are getting bid up," says Hal Feinberg, a Phoenix property investor. "You can still get good deals, but you've got to be more patient than you were a year ago." He and other investors in the Phoenix area say they have been flipping a lot of the homes they buy to Canadians taking advantage of a weak U.S. dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying at these auctions is perilous. There are no public viewings, so bidders often can't know how much damage may have been done inside a house by occupants facing foreclosure. "We've seen everything," says Doug Hopkins, chief executive of PostedProperties. "We've seen people pour concrete down the toilets." Unless they've done their homework, bidders also don't always know whether they're buying a home subject to a lien from another lender, which can happen in cases where the borrower took out more than one home loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of such complexities, many of the bidders are people with experience in the property business. Jon Goodman, a real-estate lawyer in Boulder, Colo., for example, has bought 19 properties so far this year with other investors and sold 11 of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, the group won an auction for a home in Commerce City, Colo., near Denver, by bidding $142,000. Only afterwards did they discover that the previous owners had stripped the house of a toilet, much of the carpeting and a kitchen range. They replaced the missing items and made other minor improvements, eventually selling the house in May for $209,000. (The loan balance on the house had been $265,663.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Goodman says their expenses came to about $24,000, including about $8,000 for real-estate commissions. That left a pretax profit of about $43,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The foreclosure auction was handled by <span class="companylink">American Home Mortgage</span> Servicing. Ms. Sullivan, the spokeswoman for American Home, says the firm believes it didn't underprice the home and it received "a fair, market-value price for the property."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Miami, a group of investors led by Oded M. Kaiser recently bought a condo at auction for $170,000. Two weeks later, they flipped it for $330,000. The loan balance was about $466,000. A spokeswoman for <span class="companylink">Litton Loan Servicing</span>, which handled the sale on behalf of mortgage investors, declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all flippers come out on top. Mr. Goodman says one of his legal clients, bidding on his own, unwittingly bought a house that was still subject to a first-lien mortgage. To gain control of the property, the client had to pay off the first mortgage. As a result, says Mr. Goodman, the client, who declined to be named, is likely to have at least a small loss on the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, Phoenix investor Greg Thielen bought a home at an auction and later found that the former owner had stripped out air-conditioning units, granite countertops and kitchen cabinets, and uprooted palm trees from the lawn. Repair costs came to about $30,000, leaving Mr. Thielen with a small loss on the purchase. "It's not as easy as people think," says Mr. Thielen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Scottsdale property bought by Mr. Mirmelli was supposed to be the dream home for Brad and Michelle McCaughey and their three children. Mr. McCaughey, who grew up in Ann Arbor, Mich., was a minor-league hockey player and coach after graduating from the University of Michigan. About nine years ago, having moved to Phoenix, he says he discovered "a passion for real estate." He became a real-estate agent and began investing with his father and brothers-in-law in rental properties. Soon they had a dozen homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, Mr. McCaughey and his wife paid about $500,000 for 1.2 hectares of desert land and began building a home. By the time the house was nearing completion in 2008, the family rental-property business was in trouble because financing and other costs were exceeding their income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The McCaugheys started selling their rental properties and put their own house on the market. They hoped to avert a foreclosure by getting <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> to accept a short sale, in which a home is sold for less than the loan balance due. Before they could find a buyer, though, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> foreclosed on the home, and it went up for auction at the Maricopa County Courthouse this past September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> initially set the minimum bid at auction at $1.3 million, far more than the market value, given comparable sales in the neighborhood. Then, on the morning of the sale, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> lowered that minimum to $379,900. PostedProperties, which monitors Web sites for such price changes, sent out an email on the opportunity to Mr. Mirmelli.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mirmelli has his iPhone set up so he can call up the address of a home due to be auctioned, see a map of the neighborhood with a tap of his finger and then see panoramic photos of the street with another tap. While he researched the home, one of his partners drove out to see the exterior and make sure there were no occupants. A PostedProperties employee bid on their behalf and won the house for $486,300, a sum that then went through the trustee to <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After expenses of about $54,000, including real-estate commissions and minor repairs, Mr. Mirmelli and his partners expect a profit of about $150,000 on the flip. "It turned out to be a very good return," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> declined to comment on the transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The McCaugheys, who formerly owned the house, are now renting a smaller home. Mr. McCaughey now works for a telecommunications service and is thinking about going back into hockey-related work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over a bowl of soup at a Paradise Bakery &amp;Cafe in Glendale, a suburb of Phoenix, Mr. McCaughey says he sees a lot of real-estate bargains now and may jump back into the market at some point. As for the losses he's taken on his former holdings, he says: "It is what it is. You deal with it."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Chicago hotel that was part of developer Robert Falor's ill-fated effort to build a condo-hotel empire has sold for a fraction of its debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fund managed by Canyon Capital Realty Advisors of Los Angeles bought the 437-room Hotel 71 for $37 million. The all-cash deal wiped out tens of millions of dollars in debt, according to people familiar with the transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller was a special servicer managing about $68 million of debt backed by the property that was carved up and sold as commercial mortgage-backed securities. The bondholders were represented by a special servicer that took control of the 40-story building in a July 2008 foreclosure action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The history and sale of Hotel 71 shines additional light on the busted business model of condo-hotels, which typically allows unit owners to rent rooms when they aren't using them. At the peak of the real-estate boom, many small investors snapped up condo-hotel units. But the economic collapse, which has hit the hotel and condo markets the hardest of any commercial-property class, naturally hasn't been kind to the hybrid property type.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canyon plans to complete the renovation Mr. Falor started but has no intention of pursuing his condo-hotel strategy. Rather, the property will be operated as a traditional hotel, according to people familiar with the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hotel 71 deal also marks another loss for Mr. Falor's empire. At the peak of the market, Mr. Falor, 41 years old, was a prominent national developer of condo-hotels with numerous properties in Illinois and Miami. As the market soured, a number of Mr. Falor's projects have become mired in litigation and other problems. At Hotel 71, only about 309 of the rooms are operational as renovation plans have stalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Mr. Falor alleging that he misappropriated money from investors that was intended to fund the conversion of several properties in Illinois and Florida into hotel condominiums, and that Mr. Falor did so by taking funds intended for those projects and using the money instead for unrelated real estate, cars and private airplanes. Hotel 71 was not included in the properties named in the suit. A court filing on behalf of Mr. Falor states that the hotel condominium industry has proven not to be lucrative for Mr. Falor and others like him and states that some of the counts in the SEC complaint should be dismissed because they lack specificity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, Mr. Falor is scheduled to go on trial early next year in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, on a theft charge. In that case, the prosecution alleges Mr. Falor deceived a Cleveland businessman by persuading him to invest in a Chicago property that Mr. Falor didn't own, according to a spokesman for the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's Office. Mr. Falor pleaded not guilty to the theft charge. Mr. Falor's attorney didn't return calls for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite Hotel 71's problems, the project had one recent moment of glory: It was used in "The Dark Knight," a Batman movie. A ballroom on the 39th floor of the tower was turned into the fictional Bruce Wayne's apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hotel 71 saga stretches back to 2005 when Chicago H&amp;S Hotel Property LLC, then affiliated with Mr. Falor, bought it for about $95.5 million and loaded it up with about $128 million in debt. In 2006 Mr. Falor defaulted on a mezzanine loan originally valued at about $27.3 million that was provided by Los Angeles hedge fund and private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Oaktree Capital Management LLC</span>. Last year, Oaktree obtained judgments against the guarantors of the debt, a group that includes Mr. Falor, and is seeking to enforce them, said John Berry, an attorney for Oaktree. By mid-2007 the property was delinquent on a $68 million commercial mortgage-backed security originated in 2005, according to Trepp, a New York firm that tracks commercial real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hotel was put on the block in January by the special servicer. The sellers had hoped the property would sell in the $100 million range, but instead got nibbles and one written offer over the summer in the $20 million range, said Bill Hodges, chief executive of Hodges Ward Elliott of Atlanta, a real-estate brokerage firm that specializes in lodging properties which marketed the property. "It's a great property, great real estate with a great location but the industry has just really been hurt," Mr. Hodges says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, Canyon stepped up with the highest bid. Canyon isn't new to the property. The Los Angeles private-equity firm, was one of Mr. Falor's lenders, putting some $32.7 million of junior debt on the property that was eventually wiped out. But the purchase of Hotel 71 was described as an arm's-length transaction, with no special consideration or credit given to Canyon for their extinguished debt, said people familiar with the transaction.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>489 words</div><div>9 December 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes listed for sale declined in many U.S. cities in November, but more houses are likely to hit the market early in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes available for sale in 27 major metropolitan areas at the end of November was down 2.4% compared with a month earlier, according to figures compiled by ZipRealty Inc., a real-estate brokerage firm based in Emeryville, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories typically decrease modestly in November compared with the previous month, according to Zelman &amp;Associates, a research firm. Over the past 25 years, the average change has been a decline of 1.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The November inventory in the 27 metro areas was down 28% compared with the year-earlier period, according to ZipRealty. The ZipRealty data cover all single-family homes, condominiums and town houses listed on local multiple-listing services in metro areas where the firm operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Zip data, however, don't include New York. Miller Samuel Inc., an appraisal firm there, reports there were 7,667 cooperative apartments and condominiums on the market in the borough of Manhattan at the end of November. That was down 7.1% from the end of October, and down 18% from November 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exact level of supply is impossible to pin down, partly because multiple listing services don't include all the foreclosed homes that banks are preparing to put on the market. As of the end of October, banks and mortgage investors had 639,000 foreclosed homes for sale across the U.S., <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> estimates. That's equivalent to more than 10% of expected U.S. home sales this year. The bank-owned homes are largely concentrated in Florida, California, Arizona and Nevada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">October was the first month since January to show a rise in the estimated number of bank-owned homes. The supply had dipped over the summer because efforts to keep families in their homes with easier loan terms slowed down the legal process of foreclosure. Meanwhile, the backlog of homes heading for foreclosure has been building up. "We expect a rebound in distressed inventory in the coming months," says Glenn Boyd, a senior analyst at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimated 7.5 million households are behind on mortgage payments or in the foreclosure process, and a large share of those homes eventually are likely to be put on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, many homeowners have been awaiting signs of a stronger market before trying to sell. They are likely to put up for-sale signs early in the new year to attract buyers seeking to qualify for a federal tax credit on purchases of homes made before the end of April, says Patrick Lashinsky, chief executive officer of ZipRealty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is going to be a lot more inventory on the market by February or March," he predicts.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sari Krieger </div><div>711 words</div><div>7 December 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>R2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For home buyers, green is fast becoming a priority -- whether it's because they want to reduce their energy costs, minimize their carbon footprint or improve indoor air quality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are 10 questions that prospective buyers or renters ought to ask to find out how green a house or apartment is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. How big is it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bigger the home, the more energy it uses. The U.S. Green Building Council considers a "neutral size" home -- basically what most people need, without what might be considered luxury space -- to be 900 square feet for a one-bedroom home, 1,400 square feet for two bedrooms and 1,900 square feet for three bedrooms. A 100% increase in the size of the home adds anywhere from 15% to 50% to energy use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Where is it located?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can you walk to public transportation? Are there sidewalks or easy places to walk in the neighborhood, so you don't always have to drive? How close are shopping centers and other places you would frequent? The Web site walkscore.com rates the walkability of cities, neighborhoods and individual addresses and shows the distances to stores, restaurants, schools and amusements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. How is it oriented?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South-facing windows can trim heating costs in the winter. Shading from trees to the south and west can reduce cooling costs in the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Is it well insulated, and are doors and windows sealed tightly against air leaks?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Energy Star Web site, energystar.gov, features a calculator to help determine how much insulation you need, based on your location. To guard against air leaks, windows and exterior doors ideally should have an Energy Star rating, which indicates they meet a certain standard of efficiency in preventing the loss of heat in the winter and cooling in the summer. You may be able to feel air leaks, or you can hire an energy auditor to conduct a "door blower test" -- a big fan placed in a doorway sucks air out of the home, creating easily detectable drafts rushing in from outside wherever there's a leak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. Has the indoor air quality been tested?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well-insulated, well-sealed homes not only hold in heat and cooling, but also can retain toxins such as formaldehyde, mold, asbestos and lead. A test will show whether any toxins are present in levels that exceed the safe maximums established by the Environmental Protection Agency. You might also ask whether the home was constructed or renovated with nontoxic building materials and furnishings, like low- and zero-emission paints and sealants and materials like strawboard for the subflooring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. If it's an older home, have insulation, heating and cooling systems and appliances been upgraded?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newer products are far more efficient than those bought several years ago. Also, has higher-efficiency lighting been installed?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7. How efficient is the water usage?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are the kitchen and bathrooms equipped with water-efficient plumbing fixtures? If it's a house, does it have a water-conserving irrigation system for the grounds, and landscaping that minimizes the use of water? It may also have a rainwater collection and storage system, particularly in drier areas where water is increasingly scarce and costly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8. What's on the roof?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lighter-colored roof reflects more heat than a dark-colored roof, which absorbs heat, putting more strain on the cooling system. Does it have skylights that let in natural light?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9. Where do the home's materials come from?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recycled or salvaged building materials reduce the home's impact on the environment. Also preferable are materials that are locally available, can be processed with less energy and water, are reusable or recyclable, are durable, and are abundant in the environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10. Has it been certified green?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Green Building Council, the Environmental Protection Agency and others offer ratings on homes, based on inspections by trained third-party professionals.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Gwendolyn Bounds </div><div>1956 words</div><div>3 December 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B11</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, 40-year-old Shane Dawley and his 36-year-old wife, Rhonda, uprooted themselves and their four boys from their suburban Atlanta rental home and bought an old five-acre farmhouse in Ogdensburg, Wisc. Their goal: Flee the rat race and adopt a more self-reliant lifestyle amid the troubled economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Dawley, who had worked at a parking garage, hasn't found a full-time job yet, he's been working on nearby farms learning new skills (one person paid him with an old John Deere tractor), and his family is raising chickens while learning to garden and hunt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our generation has never seen anything like this," says Mr. Dawley of the economic downturn. "Fear sometimes is a good thing and will push you to do things you ordinarily wouldn't."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While urban and suburban real estate is still generally under pressure, the rural market is holding up better in many areas, thanks in part to buyers such as the Dawleys. Sometimes dubbed "ruralpolitans," these city and town dwellers are looking at land as their new safe investment, one they hope could prove more stable than their jobs and 401(k)s -- and provide a better lifestyle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Motivations can vary, but typically there are three groups: young people buying land as an asset or investment, with vague hopes to live on it someday; exurban commuters who have jobs in big towns or cities but want to escape the sprawl; and back-to-the-land types who want to dabble in hobby farming. While the 76 million-strong baby boomers eyeing retirement represent the largest ruralpolitan segment, they're being joined by a growing contingent of 20-to-early-40-somethings freshly imprinted by this recession's pain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathryn O'Shea-Evans, a 25-year-old freelance writer, moved from Portland, Ore., to New York on Dec. 31, 2006. When the economy began floundering, she was frugal -- living in a $650-a-month boarding-house room, buying clothing in resale shops, and socking away part of each paycheck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, this past August, she flew to Montana to look at a place to invest those savings: a $12,000, 12-acre parcel of land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"From the minute I landed in New York City, every job I've had I've been worried will end any moment," says Ms. O'Shea-Evans, who is now working on a "permalance" basis as an editorial assistant at Travel + Leisure magazine. She passed on the 12 acres but is continuing her rural-property search. "It's totally worth it to put every extra dime into buying something that I will know is there," she says. She is now looking for something with a house on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At United Country Real Estate Inc., one of the country's largest real estate groups dedicated to rural properties, the average residential sale price climbed 7% last year from 2006 levels, before the recession began. This year, says the firm, based in Kansas City, Mo., prices are expected to be up 2% from 2006. That's compared to an expected 22% median price decline nationally in existing single-family homes in 2009 from 2006 levels, as tracked by the National Association of Realtors -- -- a drop exacerbated by the number of distressed homes sold at discount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United broker Inez Freeman Pahlmann in West Plains, Mo., cites "a big, big trend toward the younger generation moving back to the rural" areas to be more self-sufficient, even if they earn a lower salary. Likewise, Ms. O'Shea-Evans's United Country agent, Tom VanHoose in Great Falls, Mont., says young clients in their late 20s and 30s have jumped from just a handful a few years ago to 15% of his business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most of these kids say they've just saved and want to put their money someplace that won't go away," Mr. VanHoose says. "They see General Motors go down and AIG go down and they are asking, 'Gee, can my company go down?' There's a lot of angst and anxiety."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Mossy Oak Properties Inc., a West Point, Miss.-based real estate franchise specializing in rural properties, royalties from sales rose almost 10% in the first three quarters of 2009 from a year earlier. Higher commodity prices in recent years have helped boost rural land values in some farming regions, says Lannie Wallace, Mossy Oak's executive vice president, who believes younger clients view farm and timberland as a long-term investment. "They've seen their parents' stock investments lose 30% to 40% and think: 'If I buy this piece of property and all else fails, I've still got this piece of property.' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly the country life isn't for everyone, and the grass can stop seeming quite so green when you actually get there. Surprises such as backed-up septic systems, murky well water, voracious weeds and assorted vermin add their own pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dawley's family wanted to raise chickens for eggs, but when they bought the generic "assortment" mix at the local cooperative, they ended up with more roosters than hens. He and his nine-year-old, James, decided to try killing one -- "My wife didn't want anything to do with that," he says -- and cooking it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turns out that roosters can be tough. "We took one bite and it was like, 'We can't eat this thing,'" says Mr. Dawley. Their garden ambitions fizzled after the soil turned out to be acidic (they didn't test it first) and half the crops died. "That will all be different next year," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, when Kent Wiles, 48, and his wife, Lynn, 50, and daughter, Zia, 11, first moved from Portland, Ore., to rural Clatskanie, they were eager to buy horses but didn't do enough homework. The first season, the horse destroyed the fields by overgrazing and punching holes in the pasture, until Mr. Wiles learned he needed to fence off sections and rotate the animals. And then there was the manure: "Horses are just massive pooping tubes with four legs," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He heaped the waste into smelly piles that attracted flies, before deciding to build bins. "I was out there in the winter in the dark with the headlights of the truck going, freezing my hands off building these bins," he says. "And I'm realizing, 'Hmmm, this isn't how I pictured it.' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">History shows economic downturns or disasters such as the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks frequently trigger a short-lived appetite for escape, and that those approaching retirement often crave more-remote properties. If baby boomers follow typical migration patterns, the rural population age 55-85 will increase by 30% between 2010 and 2020, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other factors, such as widespread Internet access, are giving this current ruralpolitan trend new longevity, particularly among younger generations. Enhanced renewable-energy options and associated tax credits mean homes can be more affordably powered by the sun or wind in areas where utility companies won't service cheaply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Younger buyers, such as Jesse Ptacek, 27, have time to reap payback from such investments. For the past few years, Mr. Ptacek has watched the U.S. economy flounder from Kuwait, where he's a firefighter for a U.S. Department of Defense contractor. Knowing he will likely face bleak job prospects upon his return home in January, he recently bought 62 acres of land in Montana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His new spread, for which he paid $225,000, includes a 2,100-square-foot, three-bedroom log home situated well off the grid. Its main heat source is a wood stove, there's bear, moose and pheasant hunting nearby, and Mr. Ptacek is erecting solar panels for electricity. He expects to commute up to 60 miles for work, likely in Great Falls or Helena.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've done the stock-market thing, and I lost money like everyone else," says the unmarried Mr. Ptacek, whose grew up in Rochester, Minn., population 100,845. "And I started to think about things, what's real, what's not real."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest in small-scale hobby farming has also bloomed, particularly among the young. When environmental-news Web site Mother Nature Network ran a piece called "40 Farmers Under 40" this year, it garnered nearly 100,000 hits, one of its most popular features since the site's launch. Visitors to the Web site of Living the Country Life magazine increasingly seek info on wood stoves, solar panels and windmills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a little like the pioneer spirit," says Betsy Freese, the magazine's editor. "They still want high-speed Internet but want to feel like they are doing something else for their families."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before his family moved to rural Clatskanie, Ore., Mr. Wiles says he was a classic "urban liberal" dweller, frequenting microbreweries, coffee shops and bookstores. Now his family lives on five acres where, in addition to horses, they also own goats and turkeys, among other animals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his wife run an employment-services company for people with disabilities. One travels 60 miles to Portland several times a week for business; otherwise, they work from home. Mr. Wiles has learned to operate a compact tractor and built a horse shed, and he has acquired several guns. "Look, we're not survivalists and storing powdered milk or anything like that, but if the s -- - hits the fan, I can grow all the food I want and take care of my family," he says. "It's liberating."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That pioneer spirit is also felt by manufacturers of compact tractors and small work-utility vehicles, such as the John Deere Gator. "What we are seeing in this [ruralpolitan] customer segment is growth," says Dan Paschke, product marketing manager for utility tractors at <span class="companylink">Deere &amp;Co</span>.'s agriculture and turf division. The biggest demographic growth segment for James River Equipment, an Asheboro, N.C., John Deere dealer, is someone who commutes to a metro market 30 to 45 minutes away. "They are buying small, easy-to-use equipment and don't have a lot of experience," says Clyde Phillips, a partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers also are tweaking seats and designs to suit this new generation of first-time users, including females. "We took a lot of women out on tests to make sure the vehicles are still badass for guys but comfortable enough for a woman to drive every day," says Aaron Hanlon, product manager for Cub Cadet Utility Vehicles, a brand of <span class="companylink">MTD Products Inc</span>. <span class="companylink">Polaris Industries Inc</span>., known for its powerful off-road utility vehicles, this month is rolling out its first low-maintenance, eco-model: an all battery-powered ride called the Ranger EV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some people, the break to rural living is a hedge against an unpredictable future. Brandon Peak is a 36-year-old technician at <span class="companylink">Intel Corp</span>. who works nights on the factory floor in Phoenix and rarely sees his wife and three children during the week. Mr. Peak's company laid off workers this year, and he's received no raise. So when his parents called recently to say they'd purchased 80 acres in Missouri, and asked if he and his family would join them to start a dairy farm, their son jumped at the chance. They're scheduled to move in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I can't tell you how many people at work say, 'Man, I'd like to do that,' " Mr. Peak says. "Everybody is looking for the next opportunity for hope."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Prices of long-dated Treasury securities were lower Tuesday morning as concern over Dubai's debt problems eased, cutting the need for low-risk government debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for the 10-year and 30-year maturities traded near session lows following the midmorning releases of U.S. economic data. The monthly gauge of the manufacturing sector from the Institute for Supply Management slipped from October, while construction spending was unchanged. Pending-home sales rose, adding to signs of a stabilizing housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long-dated Treasurys fell as riskier assets from global stocks to commodities rallied amid optimism that the fallout from Dubai's credit woes would be contained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Riskier assets tumbled late last week after Dubai said it planned to restructure Dubai World, which is struggling with liabilities of about $60 billion, and will seek a debt standstill from creditors. Dubai World broke six days of silence early Tuesday morning and announced details of its proposed debt restructuring, saying it was having constructive talks with banks over about $26 billion in affected debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of the buyers [of Treasurys] from last week are taking profits as the market realizes that the Dubai crisis was not as important in the big picture,"" said Michael Franzese, managing director and executive vice president of bond trading at Wunderlich Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, David Ader, head of government-bond strategy at CRT Capital Group LLC, said the bullish underpinnings for the market aren't gone, just set aside in favor of attempts at defining the range. Mr. Ader noted that the 10-year note's yield flirted with the 3.20% resistance level, a break of which may lead to a test of the 3.10% to 3% zone, leaving it a real possibility that the yield could dip below 3% before 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At late morning, the two-year note rose 1/32 to 100 6/32 to yield 0.6552%; the 10-year note was down 9/32 to 101 6/32 to yield 3.2344%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks climbed as concerns about the Dubai World debt crisis eased and reports on construction spending and pending home sales beat expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At midday in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.3% to 10475.58. Of the 30 Dow components, 28 advanced, led by <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span>, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> and Caterpillar, up more than 2.5% each. <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> and <span class="companylink">American Express</span> fell 1%, after Monday's late surge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The late-day rally in financial stocks Monday came after Dubai World said it was in constructive talks with banks to restructure $26 billion in debt, less than half of Dubai World's nearly $60 billion in total debt obligations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors moved back into riskier assets and away from the safety of the dollar. Gold hit another record, above $1,200, and crude-oil prices moved back above $78 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Were the Dow to hold onto Tuesday's gains, it would have recouped all of Friday's loss. The average sank 154 points as U.S. investors first reacted to the Dubai crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Clearly the Dubai issue was a jolt to the system to some degree," said Jeff Mortimer, chief investment officer at <span class="companylink">Charles Schwab</span>. "But the market seems to have digested that shock quite well, which says to me a lot of these issues are priced into the market already. While they'll jostle it a bit, they have not been able to knock it from its perch."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.6% to 2177.79. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500 stock index rose 1.3% to 1109.45, helped by gains in its energy and materials sectors on the rises in crude-oil and metals futures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European Markets</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European shares kicked off the final month of 2009 with a gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index rose 2.7% to 245.58 in a move led by cyclical plays. The index still is below the 247.96 close before the Dubai World news broke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European banks are seen as have having more exposure to the Middle East than Asian or U.S. lenders; the sector advanced Tuesday. <span class="companylink">HSBC Holdings</span> rose 2.7%; <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland Group</span> climbed 3.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hard-hit Greek banks also gained, with <span class="companylink">National Bank of Greece</span> rising 9.6% in Athens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index rose 2.3% to 5312.17. Germany's DAX index rose 2.7% to 5776.61. France's CAC-40 index rose 2.6% to 3775.74.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">French media conglomerate Vivendi advanced 4%. <span class="companylink">General Electric</span> agreed to buy Vivendi's stake in NBC Universal for $5.8 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Alstom</span> rose 6.7% and <span class="companylink">Schneider Electric</span> climbed 3.8% after the companies said they submitted a bid to buy the transmission and distribution assets of Areva.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. factory activity unexpectedly grew at a slower pace in November, although there were signs the sector is continuing to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, spending on construction in the U.S. was flat in October, and outlays for the preceding two months were revised far lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, a forecasting gauge of housing-market activity climbed to its highest level in more than three years in October, thanks to government tax credits that is drawing home buyers into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management reported Tuesday that its index of manufacturing activity for November moved to a reading of 53.6 from 55.7 the month before. November's reading was under the 55.0 economists had expected to see. A reading above 50 signals expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. is emerging slowly from its worst economic recession in decades. Confidence in the recovery has been based in part on the improving performance of the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While the rate of growth slowed when compared to October, the signs are still encouraging for continuing growth as both new orders and production are still at very positive levels," said Norbert Ore, who directs the survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders, a gauge of future economic activity, came in at 60.3, indicating improvement from October's 58.5, while inventories continued to shrink, at 41.3, from 46.9 the prior month. Production came in at a healthy 59.9 after October's 63.3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hiring remained a soft area for the factory sector, with the employment index at 50.8, from 53.1 the month before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. construction spending was unchanged in October, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $910.77 billion compared with the prior month, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September spending fell 1.6%; originally, Commerce estimated spending that month climbed by 0.8%. August spending dropped 0.9%, revised down from a previously estimated 0.1% decline. October spending was 14.4% lower than in October 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors said its index for pending sales of previously owned homes rose 3.7% to 114.1 in October from 110 in September. Analysts surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected pending sales would dip by 0.1%. The October increase marks the ninth consecutive rise in pending home sales.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anton Troianovski and William Boston </div><div>843 words</div><div>2 December 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Asia</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>10</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A move by Dubai's flagship conglomerate to sell some trophy properties could help turn the gears of a commercial real-estate market that's been stalled for more than a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dubai World hasn't said specifically that it plans to unload real estate in order to raise cash to pay its debts. But in a statement detailing debt-restructuring plans early Tuesday, Dubai World said the restructuring process would include "assessment of delevering options, including asset sales."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Dubai World spokesman declined to comment on possible property sales. Dubai World owns high-profile properties around the world, including office buildings in New York and London and luxury hotels across the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dubai's problems are coming to light as property investors navigate uncharted waters. Banks and troubled borrowers haven't flooded the market with cheap properties, even though rent and occupancy are still declining around the world, financing remains scarce and defaults are soaring. Lenders, hoping to avoid markdowns on their balance sheets, have largely shied away from foreclosing on overleveraged building owners. That has left investors thirsting for deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Perversely, increased availability of good quality assets to buy would improve liquidity in the market as there is strong demand at present for limited stock," says Peter Damesick, head of U.K. research at commercial real-estate services firm <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., the total value of all commercial real-estate deals of $5 million or more will reach just $49 billion in 2009, research firm <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span> projects. That is less than one-tenth of the $497 billion in deals done in 2007, and even less than the $79 billion in deals done in 2001. Meanwhile, real-estate private-equity firms around the world are sitting on $172 billion in commitments from investors, according to research firm Preqin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is no product out there, there is nothing to buy, and there's a lot of money out there that would love to buy," said Sam Zell, the real-estate "grave dancer" who made a fortune from earlier downturns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could be one of the few bits of good news for landlords who need to raise cash by selling buildings. Bidding has been especially heavy when prime properties---such as fully leased, trophy office buildings in major cities---have gone on the block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers have been most aggressive outside the U.S.. In Hong Kong, a wealthy investor in September purchased a 23-story office building for $465 million at a 4.3% yield---recalling values at the height of the bubble. In London, the average yield that buyers have been willing to accept fell one percentage point over the past six months, signaling an uptick in valuations, according to Real Capital Analytics research director Dan Fasulo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">International investors have also been looking for deals in the U.S., in some cases driving up values. German property-fund manager Deka stunned American real-estate investors when it agreed to buy a 12-story office building in Washington for $208 million. And in recent months, the Manhattan headquarters of <span class="companylink">HSBC Holdings PLC</span> drew 43 bids, according to Steve Collins of commercial brokerage <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Inc</span>., which worked on the deal. The top four second-round bidders were all international groups willing to pay all cash, Mr. Collins said. The building ended up going in October to Israeli investment company IDB Group for $330 million in cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dubai World's New York office buildings include Six Times Square, purchased for $300 million in 2007, and the 40-floor 450 Lexington Ave., acquired for $600 million in 2006, according to Real Capital. In London, Dubai World owns several postcard buildings, including the Metropole Building, 10 Whitehall Place, Grand Buildings on Trafalgar Square and the Adelphi office building on the Strand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dubai World borrowed heavily to ramp up its real-estate holdings. The company's investment arm Istithmar in the past few years borrowed about $1.1 billion to acquire five properties in the U.S., including four hotels and an office building, according to an analysis of public records by Trepp, a New York firm that tracks the commercial real-estate market. About $816 million of that debt was bundled into commercial-mortgage-backed securities, Trepp's study shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But top-of-the-market deals done with a lot of borrowed money may have little equity left to save, complicating any strategy to raise money by selling assets. For example, the $115 million mortgage used by Istithmar to buy the W Hotel in New York's Union Square was transferred in late September to a "special servicer" because of concerns over imminent default stemming from the hotel's dwindling cash flow, according to Trepp.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, 40-year-old Shane Dawley and his 36-year-old wife, Rhonda, uprooted themselves and their four boys from their suburban Atlanta rental home and bought an old five-acre farm in Ogdensburg, Wisc. Their goal: Flee the rat race and adopt a more self-reliant lifestyle amid the troubled economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Dawley, who had worked at a parking garage, hasn't found a full-time job yet, he's been working on nearby farms learning new skills (one person paid him with an old John Deere tractor), and his family is raising chickens while learning to garden and hunt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our generation has never seen anything like this," says Mr. Dawley of the economic downturn. "Fear sometimes is a good thing and will push you to do things you ordinarily wouldn't."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While urban and suburban real estate is still generally under pressure, the rural market is holding up better in many areas, thanks in part to buyers such as the Dawleys. Sometimes dubbed "ruralpolitans," these city and town dwellers are looking at land as their new safe investment, one they hope could prove more stable than their jobs and 401(k)s—and provide a better lifestyle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Motivations can vary, but typically there are three groups: young people buying land as an asset or investment, with vague hopes to live on it someday; exurban commuters who have jobs in big towns or cities but want to escape the sprawl; and back-to-the-land types who want to dabble in hobby farming. While the 76 million-strong baby boomers eyeing retirement represent the largest ruralpolitan segment, they're being joined by a growing contingent of 20-to-early-40-somethings freshly imprinted by this recession's pain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathryn O'Shea-Evans, a 25-year-old freelance writer, moved from Portland, Ore., to New York on Dec. 31, 2006. When the economy began floundering, she was frugal—living in a $650-a-month boarding-house room, buying clothing in resale shops, and socking away part of each paycheck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, this past August, she flew to Montana to look at a place to invest those savings: a $12,000, 12-acre parcel of land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"From the minute I landed in New York City, every job I've had I've been worried will end any moment," says Ms. O'Shea-Evans, who is now working on a "permalance" basis as an editorial assistant at Travel + Leisure magazine. She passed on the 12 acres but is continuing her rural-property search. "It's totally worth it to put every extra dime into buying something that I will know is there," she says. She is now looking for something with a house on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At United Country Real Estate Inc., one of the country's largest real estate groups dedicated to rural properties, the average residential sale price climbed 7% last year from 2006 levels, before the recession began. This year, says the firm, based in Kansas City, Mo., prices are expected to be up 2% from 2006. That's compared to an expected 22% median price decline nationally in existing single-family homes in 2009 from 2006 levels, as tracked by the National Association of Realtors——a drop exacerbated by the number of distressed homes sold at discount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United broker Inez Freeman Pahlmann in West Plains, Mo., cites "a big, big trend toward the younger generation moving back to the rural" areas to be more self-sufficient, even if they earn a lower salary. Likewise, Ms. O'Shea-Evans's United Country agent, Tom VanHoose in Great Falls, Mont., says young clients in their late 20s and 30s have jumped from just a handful a few years ago to 15% of his business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most of these kids say they've just saved and want to put their money someplace that won't go away," Mr. VanHoose says. "They see General Motors go down and AIG go down and they are asking, 'Gee, can my company go down?' There's a lot of angst and anxiety."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Mossy Oak Properties Inc., a West Point, Miss.-based real estate franchise specializing in rural properties, royalties from sales rose almost 10% in the first three quarters of 2009 from a year earlier. Higher commodity prices in recent years have helped boost rural land values in some farming regions, says Lannie Wallace, Mossy Oak's executive vice president, who believes younger clients view farm and timberland as a long-term investment. "They've seen their parents' stock investments lose 30% to 40% and think: 'If I buy this piece of property and all else fails, I've still got this piece of property.' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly the country life isn't for everyone, and the grass can stop seeming quite so green when you actually get there. Surprises such as backed-up septic systems, murky well water, voracious weeds and assorted vermin add their own pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dawley's family wanted to raise chickens for eggs, but when they bought the generic "assortment" mix at the local cooperative, they ended up with more roosters than hens. He and his nine-year-old, James, decided to try killing one—"My wife didn't want anything to do with that," he says—and cooking it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turns out that roosters can be tough. "We took one bite and it was like, 'We can't eat this thing,' " says Mr. Dawley. Their garden ambitions fizzled after the soil turned out to be acidic (they didn't test it first) and half the crops died. "That will all be different next year," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, when Kent Wiles, 48, and his wife, Lynn, 50, and daughter, Zia, 11, first moved from Portland, Ore., to rural Clatskanie, they were eager to buy horses but didn't do enough homework. The first season, the horse destroyed the fields by overgrazing and punching holes in the pasture, until Mr. Wiles learned he needed to fence off sections and rotate the animals. And then there was the manure: "Horses are just massive pooping tubes with four legs," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He heaped the waste into smelly piles that attracted flies, before deciding to build bins. "I was out there in the winter in the dark with the headlights of the truck going, freezing my hands off building these bins," he says. "And I'm realizing, 'Hmmm, this isn't how I pictured it.' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">History shows economic downturns or disasters such as the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks frequently trigger a short-lived appetite for escape, and that those approaching retirement often crave more-remote properties. If baby boomers follow typical migration patterns, the rural population age 55-85 will increase by 30% between 2010 and 2020, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other factors, such as widespread Internet access, are giving this current ruralpolitan trend new longevity, particularly among younger generations. Enhanced renewable-energy options and associated tax credits mean homes can be more affordably powered by the sun or wind in areas where utility companies won't service cheaply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Younger buyers, such as Jesse Ptacek, 27, have time to reap payback from such investments. For the past few years, Mr. Ptacek has watched the U.S. economy flounder from Kuwait, where he's a firefighter for a U.S. Department of Defense contractor. Knowing he will likely face bleak job prospects upon his return home in January, he recently bought 62 acres of land in Montana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His new spread, for which he paid $225,000, includes a 2,100-square-foot, three-bedroom log home situated well off the grid. Its main heat source is a wood stove, there's bear, moose and pheasant hunting nearby, and Mr. Ptacek is erecting solar panels for electricity. He expects to commute up to 60 miles for work, likely in Great Falls or Helena.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've done the stock-market thing, and I lost money like everyone else," says the unmarried Mr. Ptacek, who grew up in Rochester, Minn., population 100,845. "And I started to think about things, what's real, what's not real."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest in small-scale hobby farming has also bloomed, particularly among the young. When environmental-news Web site Mother Nature Network[http://www.mnn.com]ran a piece called "40 Farmers Under 40" this year, it garnered nearly 100,000 hits, one of its most popular features since the site's launch. Visitors to the Web site of Living the Country Life magazine increasingly seek info on wood stoves, solar panels and windmills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a little like the pioneer spirit," says Betsy Freese, the magazine's editor. "They still want high-speed Internet but want to feel like they are doing something else for their families."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before his family moved to rural Clatskanie, Ore., Mr. Wiles says he was a classic "urban liberal" dweller, frequenting microbreweries, coffee shops and bookstores. Now his family lives on five acres where, in addition to horses, they also own goats and turkeys, among other animals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his wife run an employment-services company for people with disabilities. One travels 60 miles to Portland several times a week for business; otherwise, they work from home. Mr. Wiles has learned to operate a compact tractor and built a horse shed, and he has acquired several guns. "Look, we're not survivalists and storing powdered milk or anything like that, but if the s—- hits the fan, I can grow all the food I want and take care of my family," he says. "It's liberating."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That pioneer spirit is also felt by manufacturers of compact tractors and small work-utility vehicles, such as the John Deere Gator. "What we are seeing in this [ruralpolitan] customer segment is growth," says Dan Paschke, product marketing manager for utility tractors at <span class="companylink">Deere &amp; Co</span>.'s agriculture and turf division. The biggest demographic growth segment for James River Equipment, an Asheboro, N.C., John Deere dealer, is someone who commutes to a metro market 30 to 45 minutes away. "They are buying small, easy-to-use equipment and don't have a lot of experience," says Clyde Phillips, a partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers also are tweaking seats and designs to suit this new generation of first-time users, including females. "We took a lot of women out on tests to make sure the vehicles are still badass for guys but comfortable enough for a woman to drive every day," says Aaron Hanlon, product manager for Cub Cadet Utility Vehicles, a brand of <span class="companylink">MTD Products Inc</span>. <span class="companylink">Polaris Industries Inc</span>., known for its powerful off-road utility vehicles, this month is rolling out its first low-maintenance, eco-model: an all battery-powered ride called the Ranger EV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some people, the break to rural living is a hedge against an unpredictable future. Brandon Peak is a 36-year-old technician at <span class="companylink">Intel Corp</span>. who works nights on the factory floor in Phoenix and rarely sees his wife and three children during the week. Mr. Peak's company laid off workers this year, and he's received no raise. So when his parents called recently to say they'd purchased 80 acres in Missouri, and asked if he and his family would join them to start a dairy farm, their son jumped at the chance. They're scheduled to move in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I can't tell you how many people at work say, 'Man, I'd like to do that,' " Mr. Peak says. "Everybody is looking for the next opportunity for hope."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK—Small-capitalization stocks rose as eased worries over the <span class="companylink">Dubai World</span> debt crisis and better-than-expected reports on construction spending and pending home sales sent investors back to riskier areas of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-cap stocks are widely considered riskier than their larger brethren because of their lower liquidity levels and higher volatility. In recent months, they began lagging behind large-cap stocks as investors appeared to be lowering their appetites for risk while looking for bigger, more stable stocks to put their money. Tuesday marked a reversal of that trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Dubai was a hiccup in the middle of a meal," said Bob Johnson, senior equity analyst at Satuit Capital Management. "It's not enough to deter what's going on over here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks rose 9.47, or 1.6%, to 589.20. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> SmallCap 600 index rose 4.55, or 1.5%, to 311.17.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technology sector was the S&amp;P 600's best performer, with its gainers including <span class="companylink">Sonic Solutions</span> and <span class="companylink">Symmetricom</span>. Sonic rose 95 cents, or 11%, to $9.53, while <span class="companylink">Symmetricom</span> rose 27 cents, or 6.2%, to 4.66.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health-care stocks also rose sharply among small-caps. <span class="companylink">Enzo Biochem</span> added 52 cents, or 10%, to 5.70, on the New York Stock Exchange, while <span class="companylink">LCA-Vision</span> rose 36 cents, or 6.5%, to 5.87%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the tech sector's gains, <span class="companylink">OmniVision Technologies</span> fell 1.56, or 11%, to 12.40. The Santa Clara, Calif., semiconductor company swung to a fiscal second-quarter profit, its first in a year on strong sales. But its third-quarter revenue forecast fell short of a consensus view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Netlist Inc</span>., an Irvine, Calif.-based designer and maker of memory subsystems, said a patent-infringement lawsuit filed Monday against the company by <span class="companylink">Inphi Corp</span>. "is without merit" and may be retaliation for a suit Netlist filed against Inphi in September. Still, Netlist shares fell 47 cents, or 8.2%, to 5.29. In its suit, semiconductor maker Inphi alleged some of Netlist's memory modules infringe two of Inphi's patents relating to memory-interface technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the consumer-discretionary sector, Universal Technical Institute fell 54 cents, or 2.9%, to 18.25, on the NYSE. The Phoenix provider of automotive and motorcycle technician training's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings soared, smashing its own expectations, thanks to a record-high student base. But shares dropped as investors were disappointed by the company's guidance for enrollment growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Ratings Services raised its rating outlook on Brunswick to "stable," saying the recreational-boat maker's liquidity will be enough to last through next year. The Lake Forest, Ill., company rose 69 cents, or 6.9%, to 10.73 on the NYSE.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Helix Energy Solutions</span> Group (NYSE) climbed 75 cents, or 6.4%, to 12.51. The Houston energy-services company said one of its units made two Gulf of Mexico oil-and-gas discoveries, and its new deepwater-pipelay vessel, Caesar, is on its way to the Gulf of Mexico where it will join the company's subsea construction fleet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Protalix Biotherapeutics (NYSE) fell 1.35, or 14%, to 8.51. Large-cap pharmaceutical giant <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> said it reached an agreement to help the Israel-based biopharmaceutical company develop and commercialize a treatment for Gaucher's disease. Investors appeared to be disappointed that Protalix didn't leverage its Gaucher's disease drug for a takeover, or that the terms of the <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> deal weren't more generous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building-products maker <span class="companylink">Beacon Roofing</span> Supply climbed 1.01, or 6.6%, to 16.38. The Peabody, Mass., company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings fell 24%, but earnings per share were slightly ahead of analysts' estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vanguard Natural Resources fell 77 cents, or 4.1%, to 18.05, on the NYSE. The Houston limited-liability company focused on acquiring and developing natural-gas and oil properties priced its offering of at least 2.3 million units at a 4.4% discount to Monday's closing price.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A move by Dubai's flagship conglomerate to sell some trophy properties could help turn the gears of a commercial real-estate market that has been stalled for more than a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Dubai World</span> hasn't said specifically that it plans to unload real estate in order to raise cash to pay its debts. But in a statement detailing debt-restructuring plans early Tuesday, <span class="companylink">Dubai World</span> said the restructuring process would include "assessment of delevering options, including asset sales." A <span class="companylink">Dubai World</span> spokesman declined to comment on possible property sales. <span class="companylink">Dubai World</span> owns high-profile properties around the world, including office buildings in New York and London and luxury hotels across the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dubai's problems are coming to light as property investors navigate uncharted waters. Banks and troubled borrowers haven't flooded the market with cheap properties, even though rent and occupancy are still declining around the world, financing remains scarce and defaults are soaring. Lenders, hoping to avoid markdowns on their balance sheets, have largely shied away from foreclosing on overleveraged building owners. That has left investors thirsting for deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Perversely, increased availability of good quality assets to buy would improve liquidity in the market as there is strong demand at present for limited stock," says Peter Damesick, head of U.K. research at commercial real-estate services firm <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., the total value of all commercial real-estate deals of $5 million or more will reach just $49 billion in 2009, research firm <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span> projects. That is less than one-tenth of the $497 billion in deals done in 2007, and even less than the $79 billion in deals done in 2001. Meanwhile, real-estate private-equity firms around the world are sitting on $172 billion in commitments from investors, according to research firm Preqin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is no product out there, there is nothing to buy, and there's a lot of money out there that would love to buy," said Sam Zell, the real-estate "grave dancer" who made a fortune from earlier downturns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could be one of the few bits of good news for landlords who need to raise cash by selling buildings. Bidding has been especially heavy when prime properties—such as fully leased, trophy office buildings in major cities—have gone on the block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers have been most aggressive outside the U.S.. In Hong Kong, a wealthy investor in September purchased a 23-story office building for $465 million at a 4.3% yield—recalling values at the height of the bubble. In London, the average yield that buyers have been willing to accept fell one percentage point over the past six months, signaling an uptick in valuations, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span> research director Dan Fasulo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">International investors have also been looking for deals in the U.S., in some cases driving up values. German property-fund manager Deka stunned American real-estate investors when it agreed to buy a 12-story office building in Washington for $208 million. And in recent months, the Manhattan headquarters of <span class="companylink">HSBC Holdings PLC</span> drew 43 bids, according to Steve Collins of commercial brokerage <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Inc</span>., which worked on the deal. The top four second-round bidders were all international groups willing to pay all cash, Mr. Collins said. The building ended up going in October to Israeli investment company IDB Group for $330 million in cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Dubai World</span>'s New York office buildings include Six Times Square, purchased for $300 million in 2007, and the 40-floor 450 Lexington Ave., acquired for $600 million in 2006, according to Real Capital. In London, <span class="companylink">Dubai World</span> owns several postcard buildings, including the Metropole Building, 10 Whitehall Place, Grand Buildings on Trafalgar Square and the Adelphi office building on the Strand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They own a lot of assets that a broad swath of investors would love to get their hands on," Real Capital's Mr. Fasulo said of <span class="companylink">Dubai World</span>. But, he added, "even if some of these prime assets do come to market, I think that any who believe that they're going to pick them up for pennies on the dollar are living in a fantasy land."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Dubai World</span> borrowed heavily to ramp up its real-estate holdings. The company's investment arm Istithmar in the past few years borrowed about $1.1 billion to acquire five properties in the U.S., including four hotels and an office building, according to an analysis of public records by Trepp, a New York firm that tracks the commercial real-estate market. About $816 million of that debt was bundled into commercial-mortgage-backed securities, Trepp's study shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But top-of-the-market deals done with a lot of borrowed money may have little equity left to save, complicating any strategy to raise money via asset sales. In New York, the $115 million mortgage used by Istithmar to buy the W Hotel at Union Square was transferred in late September to a "special servicer" because of concerns over imminent default stemming from the hotel's dwindling cash flow, according to Trepp. And in Miami, <span class="companylink">Dubai World</span> remains in talks with lenders to avoid default on a $670 million construction loan on the newly renovated Fontainebleau hotel there, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kelly Evans </div><div>496 words</div><div>2 December 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. manufacturing activity increased for the fourth consecutive month in November, although at a slower rate as the nation fumbles its way toward recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the housing market showed further signs of strength in October but nonresidential construction spending declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management said Tuesday that its index of manufacturing activity fell to 53.6 in November from 55.7 the prior month, although it remained above the key 50 level that indicates expansion. Although the employment and production components within the index slipped, new orders rose nearly two points to a level of 60.3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I didn't expect new orders to jump up like that so it shows some strength there, which ultimately results in strength in other components," said Norbert Ore, who leads the survey committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he cautioned that companies indicated some hesitance about hiring, and said only 12 of 18 industries surveyed reported overall growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors said its index of pending home sales, a leading indicator of actual sales, rose for the ninth consecutive month in October to a level of 114.1, its highest since March 2006. The group's chief economist, Lawrence Yun, credited the government's tax credit for first-time home buyers with "helping unleash a pent-up demand" for housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While surging demand for homes is helping to spur U.S. economic growth, weakness in other real estate continues to be a drag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall construction spending was flat in October. Spending on nonresidential projects, including hotels and office buildings, declined 1.5% to $652.2 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. That was offset by a 4.2% jump in spending on residential construction to $258.5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both housing and manufacturing activity are important barometers of the U.S. economy's health, and economists are trying to gauge whether the rebound seen in both areas this year can be sustained without the boost from government stimulus programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, for example, the ISM manufacturing index rose to 55.7 but new orders of big-ticket items known as durable goods actually slipped during the month, according to Commerce Department data released last week. A key gauge of business spending, nondefense orders for capital goods excluding aircraft, sank 2.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One bright spot: Inventories are shrinking, paving the way for an increase in future orders and production. A third of manufacturing respondents told ISM their customers' inventory levels were "too low" in November, while only 7% said they were "too high."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another boost: lower prices. Weak demand is keeping a lid on inflationary pressures. The prices component of ISM fell to 55 in November from 65 the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, the weaker dollar is helping to spur demand for exports, which ticked up half a point to an index level of 56 last month.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lingling Wei  </div><div>990 words</div><div>2 December 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A week after the first sale of commercial-mortgage-backed securities in more than a year, another deal is about to hit the market in the latest sign that capital markets are easing for corporate borrowers like real-estate investment trusts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inland Western Retail Real Estate Trust Inc., which owns some 300 retail properties nationwide, closed on Tuesday $625 million in new financing from <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co</span>. to pay down its existing debt. The bank is expected to convert the $500 million first-mortgage part of the financing into a CMBS offering and sell through private placements the remaining $125 million in "mezzanine," or junior, debt to investors hunting for higher returns, according to people familiar with the matter. A spokesman at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inland is a "nontraded" REIT whose shares are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission but don't trade on a stock exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move comes as investors at mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies and other institutions have regained their appetite for CMBS debt that features conservative underwriting, simple structures and greater safeguards for investors than CMBS sold during the boom years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This growing demand reflects a trend in the broader equity and debt markets, which have started to open up for REITs and other corporations. So far this year, REITs have raised more than $20 billion by selling shares and bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the turn of the capital markets is still tentative. But it has led scores of small and private real-estate owners -- the type that is still finding it hard to access capital -- to think about going public to raise capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We believe this transaction gives us a significant amount of credibility in the marketplace as we continue to focus on our refinancing and deleveraging strategies," Steven Grimes, Inland's Chief Executive, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The return of the new-issue CMBS market is considered essential to help avert what could be a serious crisis in the market for offices, hotels, strip malls and other commercial property. An estimated $1.4 trillion of commercial mortgages are expected to mature through 2013, but financing sources of all types including the CMBS market have dried up. According to <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> research, banks' lending to commercial real estate is down 86.5% from the market peak in 2007 and the lending by life insurance companies is down 71.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Inland offering, if successful, could provide more cheers to the CMBS market because it will likely get done without federal assistance. Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve expanded its Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, program to include CMBS because the Fed was concerned about the dearth of real estate financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first post-bust CMBS sale, the $400 million offering late last month by <span class="companylink">Developers Diversified Realty Corp</span>., was TALF-driven. But most investors in the deal opted not to use government funding. Institutional investors were attracted to the deal because it was viewed as a low-risk investment with relatively healthy returns when compared with other securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another CMBS deal being marketed to investors right now is a $460 million offering backed by properties owned by private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Fortress Investment Group</span>. That deal, led by <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>., also doesn't expect to use TALF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Buchta, a market strategist at Guggenheim Capital Markets, called the TALF program the "seal of approval" that helped drive demand for the Developers Diversified deal. "I would expect that all things being equal, a non-TALF deal would probably be priced at slightly wider spreads than a TALF deal because of this finance ability," Mr. Buchta said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Inland, of Oak Brook, Ill., the $625 million in new financing represents a big relief as it has about $789 million in debt coming due by the end of this year and another $1.5 billion maturing in 2010, according to the company's third-quarter report. So far, the company has refinanced almost all the debt maturing this year and a sizable portion of the debt coming due next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike publicly traded REITs, a private REIT like Inland doesn't have access to the common equity market. "They could go out and do an initial public offering and generate proceeds to pay down debt, but it's a difficult process," says analyst Nicholas Vedder at Green Street Advisors. If Inland is able to raise money from the secured debt market, "that would be a large advantage for them in the near term," Mr. Vedder says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $625 million in 10-year financing is backed by 55 retail stores owned by Inland throughout the country, and represents 75% of the property's value. The loan-to-value ratio is higher than the 50% of the Developers Diversified offering, which was collateralized by 28 shopping centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the relative high leverage, the Inland debt was underwritten based on factors including current property values, rent rolls and the potential for more downward pressures on cash flow as the health of commercial real estate typically lags behind that of the overall economy by a year or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, like the Developers Diversified deal, the Inland offering is expected to have greater safeguards to protect investors in the event of bankruptcy of the company. CMBS investors were rattled by the bankruptcy filing of <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties Inc</span>. in April because the company took 166 of its malls into bankruptcy with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surprised debt holders had believed the malls would be insulated from the parent's bankruptcy because of the way General Growth had structured the assets. That has since made investors wary of buying into CMBS deals backed by only one borrower, as opposed to multiple borrowers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Small-capitalization stocks rose as eased worries over the Dubai World debt crisis and better-than-expected reports on construction spending and pending home sales sent investors back to riskier areas of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, small-caps began lagging behind large-cap stocks as investors appeared to be lowering their appetites for risk while looking for bigger, more stable stocks to put their money. Tuesday marked a reversal of that trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Dubai was a hiccup in the middle of a meal," said Bob Johnson, senior equity analyst at Satuit Capital Management. "It's not enough to deter what's going on over here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks rose 9.47, or 1.6%, to 589.20. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> SmallCap 600 index rose 4.55, or 1.5%, to 311.17.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technology sector was the S&amp;P 600's best performer, with its gainers including <span class="companylink">Sonic Solutions</span> and <span class="companylink">Symmetricom</span>. Sonic rose 95 cents, or 11%, to $9.53, while <span class="companylink">Symmetricom</span> rose 27 cents, or 6.2%, to 4.66.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health-care stocks also rose sharply among small-caps. <span class="companylink">Enzo Biochem</span> added 52 cents, or 10%, to 5.70, on the New York Stock Exchange, while <span class="companylink">LCA-Vision</span> rose 36 cents, or 6.5%, to 5.87%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the tech sector's gains, <span class="companylink">OmniVision Technologies</span> fell 1.56, or 11%, to 12.40. The Santa Clara, Calif., semiconductor company swung to a fiscal second-quarter profit, its first in a year on strong sales. But its third-quarter revenue forecast fell short of a consensus view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Protalix Biotherapeutics (NYSE) fell 1.35, or 14%, to 8.51. Large-cap pharmaceutical giant <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> said it reached an agreement to help the Israel-based biopharmaceutical company develop and commercialize a treatment for Gaucher's disease. Investors appeared to be disappointed that Protalix didn't leverage its Gaucher's disease drug for a takeover, or that the terms of the <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> deal weren't more generous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building-products maker <span class="companylink">Beacon Roofing</span> Supply climbed 1.01, or 6.6%, to 16.38. The Peabody, Mass., company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings fell 24%, but earnings per share were slightly ahead of analysts' estimates.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For $28 Million in Kauai</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Movie executive Peter Guber has sold his Kauai home for $28 million, nearly four times what he paid 11 years ago. Mr. Guber first listed the Hawaiian estate about four years ago for $46.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roughly 174-acre property, which Mr. Guber named Tara Plantation, is on the eastern side of Kauai and includes a 13,154-square-foot plantation-style main house with six bedrooms, eight baths and a powder room. The property has two guest houses; horse stables, a pool, beach cabana and yoga studio; and a caretaker's house. The 67-year-old Mr. Guber, whose production credits include "Rain Man" and the 1989 "Batman," bought the oceanfront property for nearly $7.5 million in 1998 through Mandalay Properties Hawaii LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A former chief executive of <span class="companylink">Sony Pictures Entertainment</span>, Mr. Guber is chairman and CEO of Mandalay Entertainment Group. He had cut Tara Plantation's offering price to $39.5 million in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hannah Sirois of Kauai Heritage Properties represented the buyer, who remains unidentified. Barbara L. Sloan and Malia Powers of Coldwell Banker Bali Hai Realty represented Mr. Guber.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NFL's Ex-Giant Strahan</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lists His New York Loft</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retired New York Giants defensive end Michael Strahan is offering his loft in Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood for $1.875 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Strahan, 38 years old, is a football analyst on Fox NFL Sunday and stars in the Fox sitcom "Brothers." The 1,911-square-foot condominium has one bedroom, a home office and two bathrooms. The high-floor apartment, with 15-foot ceilings and sandblasted brick walls, is in a converted pre-World War II commercial building. It has a full-time doorman, a gym and a kids' playroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The defensive end, who holds the NFL record for sacks in a single season and played 15 seasons with the Giants before retiring in 2007, bought the apartment in August 2008 as a pied-a-terre, but he's hardly used the place given his television shooting schedule in Los Angeles, says his broker, Frances Katzen of Prudential Douglas Elliman. Mr. Strahan also owns homes in Texas and California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tennis's Wilander Cuts Price</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tennis champion Mats Wilander has trimmed the price of his home in the Idaho resort area of Sun Valley to $5.95 million, a 30% cut from the original listing price two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wilander, a seven-time Grand Slam singles-event winner, bought the 81-acre estate in the 1990s with his wife, Sonya, and built a home there in 1999. The 10,500-square-foot contemporary house has seven bedrooms, eight baths, a large exercise room and a soundproofed music room. There's also a lap pool and hot tub, a guest house and caretaker's residence. The estate, a 20-minute drive from Ketchum, is bordered by undeveloped private and public lands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trent Jones, of Hall &amp;Hall's Sun Valley office, has the listing.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Simon and James R. Hagerty </div><div>1085 words</div><div>25 November 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>9</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proportion of U.S. homeowners who owe more on their mortgages than the properties are worth has swelled to about 23%, threatening prospects for a sustained housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 10.7 million households had negative equity in their homes in the third quarter, according to First American CoreLogic, a real-estate information company based in Santa Ana, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These so-called underwater mortgages pose a roadblock to a housing recovery because the properties are more likely to fall into bank foreclosure and get dumped into an already saturated market. Economists from <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;Co</span>. said Monday they didn't expect U.S. home prices to hit bottom until early 2011, citing the prospect of oversupply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have fallen so far that 5.3 million U.S. households are tied to mortgages that are at least 20% higher than their home's value, the First American report said. More than 520,000 of these borrowers have received a notice of default, according to First American.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most U.S. homeowners still have some equity, and nearly 24 million owner-occupied homes don't have any mortgage, according to the Census Bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Negative equity "is an outstanding risk hanging over the mortgage market," said Mark Fleming, chief economist of First American Core Logic. "It lowers homeowners' mobility because they can't sell, even if they want to move to get a new job." Borrowers who owe more than 120% of their home's value, he said, were more likely to default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage troubles are not limited to the unemployed. About 588,000 borrowers defaulted on mortgages last year even though they could afford to pay -- more than double the number in 2007, according to a study by Experian and consulting firm <span class="companylink">Oliver Wyman</span>. "The American consumer has had a long-held taboo against walking away from the home, and this crisis seems to be eroding that," the study said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just months after showing signs of leveling off, the housing market has thrown off conflicting signals in recent weeks. On Tuesday, the U.S. home prices logged their fifth monthly increase in September, according to the S&amp;P Case-Shiller home-price indexes. But David M. Blitzer, chairman of S&amp;P's index committee, noted the gains in the most recent month are more modest than during the seasonally strong summer months, as fewer cities saw month-to-month improvements in September than in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jittery home builders and bad weather led to a 10.6% drop in new home starts in October, and applications for home-purchase mortgages have dropped sharply in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These same falling prices have boosted home sales from the depressed levels of last year. The National Association of Realtors reported Monday that sales of previously occupied homes in October jumped 10.1% from September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.1 million, the highest since February 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bump in sales was ahead of forecasts, spurred by falling prices, low mortgage rates and a federal tax credits for buyers. Congress recently expanded and extended the tax credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest First American data aren't comparable to previous estimates because the company revised its methodology. First American now accounts for payments made by homeowners that reduce principal, and it no longer assumes that home-equity lines of credit have been completely drawn down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes reduced the total number of borrowers under water -- although both old and new methodology show increases from the previous quarter. Using the old methodology, the portion of underwater borrowers would have increased to 33.8% in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners in Nevada, Arizona, Florida and California are more likely to be deeply under water, according to the analysis. In Nevada, for example, nearly 30% of borrowers owe 50% or more on their mortgage than their home is worth, said First American.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 40% of borrowers who took out a mortgage in 2006 -- when home prices peaked -- are under water. Prices have dropped so much in some parts of the U.S. that some borrowers who took out loans more than five years ago owe more than their home's value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even recent bargain hunters have been hit: 11% of borrowers who took out mortgages in 2009 already owe more than their home's value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Lunsford put 20% down when he bought his home in Las Vegas for $530,000 in 2004. Now, he said, his home was worth less than $300,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm to the point where I feel I will never get my head above water," said Mr. Lunsford, a retired state trooper who works for an insurance company. He said his bank won't modify his loan because he can afford his payments, and he's unwilling to walk away, he said: "We're too honest."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers with negative equity are more likely to default if they live in a state where the bank can't pursue their assets in court, according to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But borrowers who are less than 20% under water are likely to maintain their mortgage if their loan is modified and the payments reduced, said Sanjiv Das, head of <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>'s mortgage unit. "Beyond 120%, the most effective modification is a complete loan restructuring, including a principal reduction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage companies have been reluctant to reduce mortgage principal over worries about "moral contagion, with people not paying their mortgage or redefaulting because they believed the bank would reduce their principal," Mr. Das said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many borrowers are so deeply under water that they can't take advantage of lower rates and refinance their mortgage. "We're declining hundreds of loans each month," said Steve Walsh, a mortgage broker in Scottsdale, Ariz. "The only way we will make headway is if we allow for a streamlined refinance where the appraisal is irrelevant."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recovery could pay off for the roughly 30% of underwater borrowers who owe 110% or less of their home's value and are able to endure the slump. "Most people prefer to stay in their home" even if the value of their property has declined, said John Burns, a real-estate consultant based in Irvine, Calif.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors reported that home sales in October were up 24% from a year earlier.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 7.5 million households were 30 days or more behind on their mortgage payments or in foreclosure at the end of September, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

</div><div class="author">By Jeff Bater and Dawn Wotapka </div><div>863 words</div><div>24 November 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>UK8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. home resales jumped in October, rising more than expected and helping to fuel a rally in stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes increased 10.1% to a 6.10 million annual rate from 5.54 million in September, the National Association of Realtors said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories kept shrinking. Prices fell, but the NAR said the decline was the smallest in more than a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 6.1 million rate was the highest since February 2007. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expected a 2.3% increase in sales during October, to a rate of 5.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many buyers have been rushing to beat the deadline for the first-time buyer tax credit," NAR economist Lawrence Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The October sales came as buyers rushed to take advantage of the tax credit before it expired Nov. 30. Though the tax credit has since been extended, several industry experts said the once-robust buyer traffic has weakened, with no recent evidence of a rebound -- possibly, because the October land grab comprised buyers who would have been scooping up homes now or over the next few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should the slowdown continue, homes could sit on the market longer, pushing the inventory count higher. The winter months are usually slow for buyers and sellers. No one wants to shop in the cold -- snow storms and ice patches derail plenty of open houses -- and sellers "don't want to have people trudge through house when it's decorated" for the holidays, said Leif Thomsen, chief executive of Mortgage Master Inc., an independent mortgage company. He estimates between 20% and 30% of sellers hold back on listings until early January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from the tax credit, low prices and mortgage rates have drawn in buyers, concerned as the U.S. unemployment rate climbed in October to 10.2%. The average 30-year mortgage rate was 4.95% in October, down from 5.06% in September, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> data showed. The NAR reported the median price for an existing home last month was $173,100, down 7.1% from $186,400 in October 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory count is "a positive sign, but it's just an aberration based on where we are based on the calendar year," Mr. Thomsen said. Existing-home sales were 23.5% higher last month than the level in October 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The October surge in sales follows a disappointing housing-sector report last week showing U.S. construction tumbled in October to the lowest point in six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is still a large pent-up demand that can be tapped before the tax credit expires," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of previously owned homes decreased 3.7% at the end of October to 3.57 million available for sale. That represented a seven-month supply at the current sales pace, compared with an eight-month supply in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, sales in October compared to September rose 11.6% in the Northeast, 14.4% in the Midwest, 12.7% in the South, and 1.6% in the West. Of the 6.10 million in overall U.S. sales, 30% were distressed, which includes foreclosures. That compares to a range of 45% to 50% in months during late 2008 and early 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About one in seven American households with mortgages is behind on payments or in foreclosure, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association last week. That is up from about one in 10 a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group reported Thursday that 14.4% of first-lien mortgages on one- to four-family homes in the third quarter were 30 days or more overdue or in the foreclosure process. That is the highest rate since the MBA began reporting such data in 1972, and works out to about 7.5 million households at risk of losing homes. The percentage is up from 10% a year earlier and 7.3% two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loan defaults have been rising swiftly for more than three years. At first, the problem largely reflected loose lending practices during the housing boom that allowed millions of people to buy homes they couldn't afford. Now the problem is compounded by rising unemployment, which hit 10.2% in October, the highest since 1982.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unemployment may start gradually declining in next year's first half, said Jay Brinkmann, the MBA's chief economist. If so, he said, the percentage of loans that are delinquent could start to decline by mid-2010. But he said the number of loans in foreclosure is likely to remain elevated longer as banks struggle to figure out which borrowers might be able to stay in their homes if payments are lowered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing faces important problems, including continuing high foreclosure rates," Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said in a speech last week. "But residential investment should become a small positive for growth next year rather than a significant drag, as has been the case for the past several years."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robert C. Pozen </div><div>815 words</div><div>24 November 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A21</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few weeks ago, President Barack Obama signed legislation extending an $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers. The refundable tax credit, available even if a family has no taxable income, will enable many more buyers to close on a home. But it also could bankrupt the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and, by doing so, damage an already weak housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit was put in place as part of the stimulus package signed into law earlier this year. Initially, it was available only to first-time buyers with a combined income of $150,000 or less ($75,000 for individuals). Approximately 40% of all first-time buyers used the credit in 2009, so extending it was strongly supported by real estate brokers, home builders and their congressional allies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The extension the president signed makes the credit available to first-time buyers, but also to people who have owned a home for at least five years. In addition, it raises the maximum income for a qualified buyer to $225,000 a year for couples and makes the credit available until mid-2010. (It had been set to expire at the end of this month.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that the FHA insures mortgages of homes below certain price levels with such a low down payment that it can be funded solely by the refundable tax credit. And, as we've seen in the recent housing crisis, buyers with no skin in the game are more likely than others to default on their mortgages when the value of their home falls below their mortgage balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's how the credit allows buyers to avoid putting their own money at risk. Suppose a couple making $60,000 annually buys a home worth $200,000. They can get an FHA-insured loan if they put down 3.5% of the purchase price, about $7,000. The couple will also need to come up with another $1,000 in closing costs, for a total of $8,000. The couple can either dip into savings or borrow that money from relatives or somewhere else on a temporary basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After closing, the couple can quickly obtain the $8,000 refundable tax credit to pay off their temporary loan (or replenish their savings). In effect, they will have bought a home without putting any of their own money at risk. Owners who don't sink their own money into a house are much more likely to default on the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FHA already is facing a rising number of serious problems on its insured mortgages. Last week the agency reported that its cash reserves dropped to 0.53% of the $685 billion of total loans it insurers. This is well below the 2% federal law requires the FHA to have in reserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond these reserves, the FHA has roughly $28 billion in a capital surplus fund, established by Congress to absorb losses on insured mortgages over the next 30 years. With the reserves and capital in hand, agency officials believe they have enough cushion to avoid needing a federal bailout. But a recent government audit concluded that the FHA would run out of money in 2011 and need a federal bailout if we have a protracted recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deteriorating quality of the FHA's mortgage portfolio is a critical challenge to the housing market and the federal budget. By the end of next year, the FHA's portfolio is projected to rise to $1 trillion. Currently, over 20% of all new home mortgages are insured by the FHA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the tax credit for first-time home buyers is expected to cost the Treasury approximately $15 billion in 2009 -- more than twice the projected cost when Congress approved the stimulus package. Some of the cost overrun is due to fraud. At least 19,000 filers who claimed $139 million in tax refunds under this credit did not actually buy a home, according to Treasury officials. In addition, 74,000 filers claiming a total of $500 million in refunds seem to already have owned a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We all want to help first-time buyers acquire homes and support the depressed U.S. housing market. Without real down payments, however, new homeowners are likely to default on their mortgages, and the FHA will probably need a taxpayer bailout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration should increase the requirements to qualify for an FHA-insured mortgage. In addition to the 3.5% down payment, the administration should also require that buyers put down at least half of the tax credit they will receive for buying the home.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. home resales jumped in October, rising more than expected and helping to fuel a rally in stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes increased 10.1% to a 6.10 million annual rate from 5.54 million in September, the National Association of Realtors said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories kept shrinking. Prices fell, but the NAR said the decline was the smallest in more than a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 6.10 million rate was the highest since February 2007. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expected a 2.3% increase in sales during October, to a rate of 5.70 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many buyers have been rushing to beat the deadline for the first-time buyer tax credit," NAR economist Lawrence Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early afternoon in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 137.47 points, or 1.3%, at 10455.63.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September existing-home sales rose 8.8% to 5.54 million; the NAR originally reported sales for that month jumped 9.4%, to 5.57 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The October surge in sales follows a disappointing housing-sector report last week showing U.S. construction tumbled in October to the lowest point in six months. A reason for the drop might have involved uncertainty over a government tax incentive for home buyers that had been due to lapse in November. Congress extended the tax credit earlier this month through April, a move that is expected to boost sales and construction into the new year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is still a large pent-up demand that can be tapped before the tax credit expires," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from the tax credit, low prices and mortgage rates have drawn in buyers. The average 30-year mortgage rate was 4.95% in October, down from 5.06% in September, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> data showed. The NAR reported the median price for an existing home last month was $173,100, down 7.1% from $186,400 in October 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of previously owned homes decreased by 3.7% at the end of October to 3.57 million available for sale. That represented a seven-month supply at the current sales pace, compared with an eight-month supply in September.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lingling Wei   </div><div>859 words</div><div>23 November 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>033</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> officially closed the book on its disastrous $6.5 billion acquisition of <span class="companylink">Crescent Real Estate Equities Co</span>. by handing the keys to lender <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>—and the man who sold the properties to <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> near the top of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move is a sign of the storm in commercial real estate that is threatening the economic recovery. Office buildings, warehouses, shopping centers and other commercial properties are losing tens of billions of dollars in value. That is putting pressure on investors, banks and other financial institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the investors swooping in to pick up the pieces: John Goff, co-founder of the firm that sold Crescent to <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> in 2007. Mr. Goff now co-owns with the <span class="companylink">Barclays PLC</span> unit a venture that will take control of more than 17 million square feet of office towers as well as investments in resorts and hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given his extensive knowledge of the Crescent portfolio, John is well suited to manage the company going forward," said Haejin Baek, head of commercial real-estate capital markets at <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Barclays</span> continues to hold $2 billion of debt on the portfolio that came due Friday. <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> had gotten several previous extensions on the loan but was facing an imminent default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our first order of business right now is focusing on improving existing properties," Mr. Goff, chairman and chief executive of the new venture, said in an interview Friday. "We have plenty of capital to deploy towards that." He wouldn't disclose how much money he invested or how much equity he has in the venture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have been buying a substantial amount of real-estate debt. This is the first big asset acquisition that I have found compelling," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crescent has been an albatross for <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, one of the largest property investors and managers on Wall Street. The New York company took $951 million in write-downs and other losses from Crescent, which owned 54 office buildings, resorts and housing projects at the time of the 2007 buyout. No further losses are expected after the deal was completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s decision to hand over Crescent's holdings to <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> "means that the value of the properties is below the debt, and Morgan didn't think the value would come back up anytime soon," said Cedrik Lachance, an analyst with Green Street Advisors Inc., a research and trading firm. A <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> spokeswoman said the transfer was made "in exchange for a full release of liability on the loans."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Goff and renowned Texas investor Richard Rainwater founded Crescent in the early 1990s. The firm went on a buying binge that turned it into one of the largest real-estate owners in the U.S. Mr. Goff was Crescent's vice chairman and CEO when it went public in 1994 and when it was sold to <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1998, Mr. Goff launched Goff Capital Partners, a private-equity firm focused on real estate that now has more than $5 billion in assets under management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s ambitions for Crescent hit turbulence soon after it bought the company. The securities firm initially planned to put the properties in one of the real-estate funds it manages for institutions and wealthy individuals. But fund investors balked at buying the buildings at top-of-the-market prices, forcing <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> to keep the properties on its balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> loan was due Aug. 3, but the U.K. bank agreed to extend it several times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> has been scaling back its risk exposure by trying to sell illiquid mortgage assets, while hiring in other areas of bond trading where securities are viewed as easier to trade and the company doesn't have to commit as much capital to serve investors and issuers. The firm had $4.4 billion in real-estate investments as of Sept. 30, down from $4.9 billion at the end of March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But bets made on real-estate before the bubble burst still are coming back to haunt the company. In 2006 and 2009, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> announced raising at least $14 billion for its series of real-estate funds known as MSREF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the commercial-real estate market soured, clients took massive losses on investments in the funds. <span class="companylink">California State Teachers' Retirement System</span>'s $400 million investment in <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s MSREF VI International LP fund was down 80% as of March 31, and <span class="companylink">Calstrs</span>'s $137 million net investment in the MSREF V U.S. LP fund was worth just $300,000. Other <span class="companylink">Calstrs</span> real-estate stakes with <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> have fared better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MSREF's bad bets include an investment in <span class="companylink">Crescent Resources</span>, a North Carolina developer unrelated to <span class="companylink">Crescent Real Estate Equities</span> that filed for bankruptcy protection in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> hasn't lost its appetite for managing real-estate investments and is in the process of raising another fund for clients.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a Better Reading, Try New-Home Sales</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. existing-home sales have surged about 25% from January through September this year and probably hit a 2009 high last month. Yet that doesn't mean the housing market, or the broader economy, is following suit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forecasters expect sales of existing U.S. homes to rise another 2% to 3%, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.7 million units when the National Association of Realtors reports October figures Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">October sales likely were driven by the Nov. 30 expiration of the first-time home-buyer tax credit, which has since been extended through mid-2010, and bargain prices on "distressed" properties such as foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while Monday's report likely will garner headlines, sales of existing homes, which make up more than 85% of the market, aren't typically looked to as a leading indicator of U.S. economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For that, construction and sales of new homes hold far bigger sway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction feeds directly into the calculation of U.S. gross domestic product, while sales directly influence GDP only through brokers' fees and commissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And amid a glut of excess inventory and an expanding foreclosure pipeline, the signal from new homes right now is much more cautious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the Commerce Department said that new-home construction sank 10.6% in October to an annualized rate of 529,000 units, the lowest level since April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists, in turn, cut their estimates of this quarter's GDP toward 3% from 3.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What the housing sector, and the U.S. economy, badly needs right now is the formation of new households to move into vacant properties and help spur demand for new ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Absent that, sales of new homes have stalled in recent months at an annualized pace of about 400,000 units; forecasters expect that pace slowed to 395,000 units when Commerce reports October figures Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a short trading week crammed with data ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, Monday's existing-home-sales report likely will grab the market's attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Wednesday's read on new-home sales probably will be a more-telling indicator of what is in store for the economy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sells Connecticut Home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fashion mogul Tommy Hilfiger has sold his Greenwich, Conn., home for $20 million. He first listed the estate more than a year ago for $27.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Set on four acres and known as Stone Hill, his 20,000-square-foot Georgian mansion has eight bedrooms and nine baths. There's a movie theater, 2,000-bottle wine cellar, indoor basketball court, tennis court, gym, sauna, spa-treatment room and pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The designer, 58 years old, paid $18 million for the newly constructed home in 2005 and added custom millwork and exotic wall treatments including cashmere and crocodile skins, among other things. Mr. Hilfiger has moved to New York City, where he recently completed interior work on his duplex at the Plaza hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hilfiger had cut Stone Hill's offering price earlier this year to $21.9 million.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lists for $14.95 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thriller writer James B. Patterson, author of more than 60 novels, has listed his Palm Beach, Fla., home for $14.95 million as he moves his family to a larger house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 7,970-square-foot plantation-style colonial home that's for sale has five bedrooms, seven baths and two powder rooms. Built in 1955 and expanded in 1993, the property has a heated pool, spa, a boat dock and 136 feet of frontage on the Intracoastal Waterway. For a writing studio, Mr. Patterson used a wood-paneled office with water views and two balconies. "I try not to face [the water] while I'm writing. It's too distracting," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Mr. Patterson, 62 years old, published "I, Alex Cross," the latest in a widely read thriller series about a psychologist. (He calls the home on sale "the house that Alex Cross built.")</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The author is moving his family to a two-acre Palm Beach estate, with a 20,505-square-foot main house, that he bought for $17.45 million this summer. Betsey Hall of Fite Shavell &amp;Associates, who represented the Pattersons on that purchase, also has the current listing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The heirs of a California builder have listed the 600-acre Middle Ranch -- for half a century, the getaway spot of film director Cecil B. DeMille -- for $28 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The former equestrian estate is in California's San Fernando Valley. The late Charles Pankow, who founded a Pasadena-based commercial building company with offices as far away as Honolulu, bought the estate in 1986 and turned it into an equine boarding and training complex that can house up to 400 horses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are 11 lighted arenas, 20 barns and pastures for horses. Several one-, two- and three-bedroom residences dot the property.

</div><div class="author">By Jeff Bater and Luca Di Leo </div><div>306 words</div><div>19 November 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home construction declined sharply in October, an unexpected reversal that led some analysts to trim their economic-growth forecasts for the last quarter of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts in October erased months of gains as uncertainty over renewal of a U.S. tax credit for home buyers increased builders' caution. They decreased 10.6% to a seasonally adjusted 529,000 annual rate compared with the prior month, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, economists at Macroeconomic Advisers lowered its fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth forecast to an annual 3% from 3.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a 1.7% increase in October housing starts, to an annual rate of 600,000. The 10.6% fall carried construction to the lowest point in six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also said building permits slipped. Both single-family groundbreakings and apartment construction tumbled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surprise decline came as an $8,000 tax credit for first-time buyers approached a Nov. 30 expiration.This month, Congress approved the credit through April, ending months of speculation whether the incentive would be extended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector is struggling out of the long slump that followed its big boom earlier in the decade. The big fall in October starts marks a setback in the sector's recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. consumer prices continued to rise only moderately in October despite a sharp gain in energy prices, confirming the Federal Reserve's view that a slow economic recovery should keep inflation at bay. The seasonally adjusted consumer-price index rose 0.3% in October, the Labor Department said Wednesday, as energy prices increased 1.5%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Min Zeng   </div><div>868 words</div><div>19 November 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Prices of longer-dated Treasurys declined after a government report showed U.S. consumer prices rose more than economists' forecasts last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short-dated Treasurys recovered from early losses as housing starts unexpectedly dropped last month while a Federal Reserve official said the central bank could keep its key interest rate near zero until 2012. The two-year note, whose yield is closely tied to changes in official interest-rate outlook, was the outperformer. The yield touched as low as 0.734%, the weakest level since late January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said if the Fed sticks to the pattern set after the last two recessions, interest rates will remain unchanged until 2012. Mr. Bullard cautioned that this pattern isn't set in stone, because central bank officials are mindful of the possible mistakes of keeping interest rates too low for too long, as many believe was the case in the middle years of this decade. Mr. Bullard will vote on monetary policy in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benchmark 10-year note was down 12/32 point, or $3.750 per $1,000 face value, at 100 2/32. Its yield rose to 3.368% from 3.323% Tuesday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond was down 27/32 point to yield 4.299%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While inflation pressure near term remained subdued, the bigger-than-expected increase in the consumer-price-index data raised angst for many investors worried about the outlook for long-term price pressure. Mr. Bullard said the economy faces a "substantial" inflation risk, but that won't occur for another "two, three, or four years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation eats into bonds' fixed return over time and is a major threat to the value of long-dated Treasurys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Not only did prices rise more quickly than the market had expected for a second consecutive month, but Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has recently suggested that the soft U.S. dollar and rising commodity prices present a further risk," said Eric Lascelles, chief economics and rates strategist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> in Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, rallied in prices following the consumer-price-index report. The value of TIPS increases along with rise in inflation. Expectation on long-term inflation also increased as measured by the yield spread between a TIPS and similar-maturity plain-vanilla, or nominal, Treasury note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year break-even rate widened by 0.047 percentage point to 2.20 percentage points, signaling that investors bet on an average annualized inflation rate of 2.2% within a decade. The gap has widened from near-zero at the start of the year as deflation risks eased. Gold, another preferred financial instrument to hedge against inflation, set its latest exchange record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Josh Stiles, bond strategist and managing director with IDEAglobal in New York, said the year-over-year CPI is likely to recover further in coming months and could turn positive given the recent rise in crude-oil prices. That suggested that "the deflation story was a little bit overblown" given the aggressive global monetary and fiscal stimulus, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With another bout of government debt supply due in coming week, bond prices would be under some downward pressure, he said. Thursday morning, the Treasury Department will release the sizes for next week's two-year, five-year and seven-year Treasury note auctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">GE Capital</span> Will Price</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Islamic Bond</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">General Electric Capital Corp</span>., a unit of <span class="companylink">General Electric Co</span>., is expected to price its planned Islamic bond worth at least $500 million at around 1.75 percentage points over U.S. Treasurys, a banker aware of the deal said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">GE Capital</span>, which met investors in London, Dubai and Asia, may price the Islamic bond, or sukuk, as early as Thursday, the banker said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">GE Capital</span> mandated <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">National Bank of Abu Dhabi</span> PJSC, and Liquidity Management Center on the sale of the bond, the banker said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York Fed Brings</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage Plan In-House</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York Federal Reserve is gradually moving its mortgage purchase program in-house, taking some operations out of the hands of external investment managers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting late November, the bank will use its own staff "on select days" to carry out purchases of mortgage-backed securities issued by government-backed housing lenders <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and Ginnie Mae under a $1.25 trillion program initiated in January. In a news release late Wednesday, the N.Y. Fed said the move is a natural progression as its inhouse expertise has grown, reducing its reliance on outsourcing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank will continue using outside investment managers, but the trading days on which its own staff conducts purchases will gradually increase over the remainder of the program, the Fed said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage-purchase program is set to expire in March 2010. As of Nov. 12, the Fed held $775.6 billion in mortgage-backed securities.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert F.X. Sillerman, the media entrepreneur who runs the company that produces American Idol, acquired 17.7 acres in Las Vegas with dreams of building a casino resort with an Elvis theme. But the plan has become the latest victim of Las Vegas’s sagging economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sillerman’s company that owns the six contiguous properties, <span class="companylink">FX Real Estate and Entertainment Inc</span>., said last week in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that the land is set to be sold as part of a prepackaged bankruptcy agreement that it has reached with lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The collapse is yet another sign of the sharp downturn of the gambling industry, which has seen Las Vegas revenue and land values plummet while forcing a few casinos and resorts into bankruptcy. FX Real Estate was never able to fund its $3 billion Elvis resort that featured a luxury hotel casino with 2,269 rooms and 93,000 square feet of casino-floor space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the cash being generated by the businesses currently on the land that includes a Harley Davidson Cafe, Travelodge and Hawaiian Marketplace, hasn’t been enough to service the $475 million mortgage loan secured by the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expected bankruptcy also may provide a barometer of just how much Las Vegas real estate has suffered. This piece of available real estate sits on the Strip near <span class="companylink">MGM Mirage</span>’s new $8.5 billion City Center development. According to the FX Real Estate filing, a bankruptcy court will auction the property with a minimum bid of $256 million. Absent a buyer, it will be sold to a new private company with Mr. Sillerman as a principal and two partners who would get a new $260 million loan from the first-lien lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of Sillerman affiliates cobbled together the Park Central Property out of six contiguous properties over an eight-year period. The company invested about $275 million to buy the land, its existing buildings and leases, and to build the Hawaiian Marketplace. FX Real Estate acquired these companies in 2007, and used proceeds of the $475 million loan to pay off the existing mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loans were originally syndicated by a <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group</span> affiliate, with $280 million in first-lien loans going to three German banks and a U.K. subsidiary of <span class="companylink">Munich Re</span>, and $195 million in second-lien loans. About $259 million in principal is outstanding on the first-lien loan, and the entire second lien remains unpaid, according to filings. That means second-lien lenders are unlikely to recover much, if anything, unless there is a bidding war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sillerman declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts in Las Vegas land and property development are mixed on whether a buyer will emerge. Wall Street analysts say the major casino operators are struggling to keep their own operations profitable and don’t have the disposable cash or financing to expand. But, Las Vegas real-estate experts say the location of the property may be too good to pass up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is going to be some interests in that one. That’s one of the best remaining opportunities in the Strip area right now,” said Charles Jack, who runs an eponymously named land and appraisal company in Las Vegas. “It’s begging for a higher and better use.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news about home construction, at least from a pricing perspective, is that fewer houses are being built. The bad news: There still are too many houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Census Bureau is due to release October housing-starts data on Wednesday. Economists estimate starts rose to an annualized pace of 600,000 units from 590,000 in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That level of starts would be down 21% from a year ago and down 74% from home construction's peak rate of 2.27 million units in January 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction has crept higher since April, as housing demand has been revived by steep price declines; rock-bottom mortgage rates; and the offer, extension and expansion of federal tax credits for home purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improvement in starts has been shaky, however, bumping along near record-low levels. Permits for new construction, a leading indicator of starts, suggest starts could stall soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In past recoveries from steep housing declines, the annualized pace of starts was back to one million units six months after the trough. They are nowhere near that level six months after the most recent housing nadir.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what is different this time? For one thing, home vacancy is the highest since the Census Bureau started keeping track in the 1950s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the third quarter, about 14.2 million housing units, or a record 10.9% of all housing units, were vacant year-round.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homeowner vacancy rate, measuring the percentage of owned units either empty or for sale, was 2.6%, near a high. Homeowner vacancy rates have averaged 1.4% in past recoveries from steep housing declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rental vacancies, meanwhile, were at a record 11.1%, compared with about 6% in past recoveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where have all the renters and owners gone? Many have moved in with family members or roommates, analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The available inventory of new single-family homes has fallen to its lowest level since 1982, notes <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> economist Michelle Meyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But between high vacancy rates and a looming wave of foreclosures that will add more supply to the market, such a low level seems justified. Starts mightn't hit the one-million mark again until late 2010, Ms. Meyer estimates.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON -- After more than two years of falling property prices, the U.K. property market appears to be showing signs of stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest evidence was delivered Tuesday by <span class="companylink">British Land Co</span>., the U.K.'s second-largest real-estate investment trust by market capitalization, which reported the first rise in the value of its assets since 2007 and said it had started making acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A positive shift in investor appetite combined with limited stock have helped market valuations since June, the company said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The performance of <span class="companylink">British Land</span> mirrors last week's results from central London landlord <span class="companylink">Great Portland Estates PLC</span>, which said that the worst was over for the property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both developers remain cautious about the outlook, however. <span class="companylink">British Land</span> warned that transaction volumes remained low and that it was "mindful that the waves caused by the financial maelstrom of the last two years have not yet settled."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British commercial property in October posted its third consecutive monthly capital growth, at 1.9%, according to the <span class="companylink">Investment Property Databank</span> Index, with capital values buoyed by improving sentiment and returning liquidity. But the recovery appears to be fragile. "As long as the negative rental cycle persists, so will the concern that the upward trend in capital values could be broken," IPD said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But landlords now are coming back to the market to make acquisitions. <span class="companylink">British Land</span> earlier in November created new executive roles to prepare for acquisitions and investments. Chief Executive Chris Grigg told reporters Tuesday that he had invested £128 million ($215.5 million) in retail and Central London offices, made bids for £500 million of property and was screening a £2 billion of potential investments. Mr. Grigg said the bulk of the outlays would be invested in the company's core markets of retail and offices. Some 3% of <span class="companylink">British Land</span>'s assets are in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">British Land</span> owns over 30 million square feet of retail space, including 50% of the Meadowhall shopping center in Sheffield, one of the largest in the U.K. It also has a large London office portfolio, including a 50% share in the Broadgate estate near London's Liverpool Street Station, Regent's Place near Euston Station and York House in the West End.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The portfolio, including the group's share of joint ventures, rose 1.4% in value in the second quarter to £8.29 billion, although it has fallen 2.4% over the past six months, <span class="companylink">British Land</span> said. Net asset value increased 3.1% in the quarter to 372 pence per share, but lost 6.5% from March 2009. <span class="companylink">British Land</span> now has a loan-to-value ratio at 29% with £3.3 billion of cash and undrawn facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Great Portland last week bought two West End development properties and is in exclusive negotiations to buy £48 million of assets. It reported a 4.2% rise in adjusted net assets per share to 225 pence from the end of July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">British Land</span>'s rentals have also improved. It said Tuesday it expects to collect an extra £8.1 million in annual rent from rent reviews and lease renewals on 2.8 million square feet of space and 510,000 square feet of new rentals. At the same time, the proportion of occupiers in administration fell to 0.8% of total rent from 1.8% in March. Its portfolio is 94% rental, with 98% of current rent still contracted in three years' time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">British Land</span> lost 2.7% to 490 pence on a slightly lower London market amid concerns about the outlook for the real-estate market. Great Portland fell 1% to 290 pence.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty   </div><div>1918 words</div><div>17 November 2009</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>A21</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market has been in a slump for the past four years. When will it ever end?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, real estate has proven as jittery and unreliable as any other market. The average U.S. home price nearly doubled between January 2000 and April 2006, according to the First American LoanPerformance index. Since then, the average has fallen about 30%. The drop has been 53% in the Las Vegas metropolitan area and 39% in Miami, where about a quarter of all households with mortgages are behind on their payments or in foreclosure. The value of your home might be determined more by whether the neighbors keep their jobs than whether the house has ample light and closet space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is a guide to navigating a fractured and volatile market:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Is the housing market getting better?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has shown some signs of healing this year, but the much-touted recovery is tentative and fragile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales have increased from the severely depressed levels of 2008. The inventory of unsold homes listed for sale also is down. Bidding wars are breaking out for foreclosed homes in the sorts of neighborhoods (near jobs and decent schools) that attract both first-time buyers and investors seeking rental properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But more than 6.7 million U.S. households with mortgages, or about 13%, are behind on their payments or are in the foreclosure process, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Eventually, many of them will lose those homes, sending more supply onto the market. Unemployment has continued to rise, and the housing market is unlikely to show a sustained recovery until job growth resumes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the supply of middle-class homes on the market has declined somewhat, it remains ample in most places. And there is a huge glut of high-end houses for sale in many areas. That means prices of high-end homes might still have a long way to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. When will housing bottom out?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There probably won't be any clear turning point. Monthly indicators, such as home sales and prices, tend to bounce erratically from month to month, making it hard to discern the underlying trend. And the housing bust will end at different times in different places. House prices already might have bottomed out in the coveted Virginia suburbs with short commutes into Washington, D.C., for instance. But it probably will be years before all of the unsold condos find buyers in parts of Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generalizations about states or metropolitan areas don't say much about what is happening in your neighborhood. In Summit, N.J., known for good schools and an easy, 45-minute train commute to Manhattan, the median home price in September was up 1.2% from a year earlier, according to Otteau Valuation Group, an appraisal company. In Atlantic City, N.J., which suffers from too much speculative building of condominiums and weak demand for vacation homes, the median price is down about 12% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. What signals should I watch to determine whether my local market is improving?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way to get a sense of supply is to ask a good local real estate agent for stats on how many homes are listed for sale in your town and how many months it would take at the current sales rate to absorb that supply. Anything over about six months generally is considered high, meaning that sellers might have to cut prices. Another way to get a sense of a neighborhood's health is to count the number of for-sale signs and vacant houses. If there are more than a couple vacant homes in a block, that might be a bad sign, particularly if no one is taking care of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes listed for sale has fallen very sharply in some areas. But the supply is likely to balloon again in many areas with a renewed surge in foreclosures. Many local newspapers provide information on foreclosure filings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand depends heavily on the job market. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics provides unemployment rates by metropolitan area. In September, they ranged from 2.9% in Bismarck, N.D., to 30% in El Centro, Calif. State and local agencies provide job-market data, too. Celia Chen, a housing economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com, says help-wanted signs can be a useful local indicator; if you start seeing more of them around your neighborhood, that is a sign that business in your area could be starting to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. How can I figure out the value of my home?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You never know for sure what a home will fetch until you put it on the market, and then it is partly a matter of luck. Will the eager buyer who shares your taste in home style and neighborhood show up on day one or day 200?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Web sites -- including <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>, HomeGain.com and Cyberhomes.com -- provide estimates of individual home values. These estimates are largely based on recent sales of nearby homes, and in some cases they are wildly off the mark. But they often provide a ballpark idea of a home's value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might come closer to the real value by talking to a local agent and looking at recent prices for homes that you know are very similar to yours. If you want to be more scientific and don't mind paying a few hundred dollars, hire a professional appraiser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. Does it matter whether I'm "under water"?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least you have plenty of company. About 20% of owners of single-family homes with mortgages owe more than the current estimated value of their homes, according to <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you can afford your monthly payment and don't need to move soon, that might not be a big problem. But it is hard, and sometimes impossible, to refinance a mortgage if you are under water, and you will take a bath if you have to sell the home now. Some people who can afford to make their monthly mortgage payments are deciding it doesn't make sense to do so because they don't expect their home values ever to recover to past peaks, and they could rent similar houses for much lower monthly costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. If I lose my home to foreclosure, how long will it take to repair my credit record?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It probably will be three to five years before you can qualify for a home mortgage insured by the government, depending on your circumstances, and that assumes you have re-established a record for paying your bills on time. The foreclosure will remain a blot on your credit record for seven years, likely raising your interest costs even if you do get another loan. If you pay bills on time, keep your credit-card balances low and don't apply for too many cards, you can make a "slow, gradual improvement" in your credit score, says Tom Quinn, a vice president at <span class="companylink">Fair Isaac Corp</span>., which provides tools for analyzing credit records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7. If I'm renting, is now a good time to buy a house?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may well be. Prices in most areas are well below their peaks, even if they haven't hit bottom. Don't kid yourself that you can time the bottom of the market perfectly. But don't feel any pressure to buy in a hurry, because the supply of housing is likely to remain ample for years in many areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally, it doesn't make sense to buy unless you expect to remain in the house for at least four or five years, because the transaction costs -- including commissions for real estate agents and mortgage fees -- are heavy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now is clearly a good time to rent. Many landlords need tenants badly. The national apartment-vacancy rate in the third quarter was 7.8%, the highest in 23 years, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a New York research firm. So landlords are cutting rents and offering such sweeteners as free flat-screen televisions or several months of free rent to retain or attract tenants. Some owners of condos will "cut their throats to get some kind of rental income to cover part of their expenses," says Jack McCabe, a real estate consultant in Deerfield Beach, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8. Can I get a tax credit if I buy a home now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under an expanded and extended program approved by Congress earlier this month, tax credits are available to many people who buy or sign a contract to buy a principal residence by April 30 and complete the purchase by June 30. The tax credit is up to $8,000 for first-time home buyers and $6,500 for people who already have owned a home for at least five consecutive years during the previous eight years. The credit is available for individual taxpayers with annual incomes of up to $145,000 or joint filers with incomes up to $245,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9. Can I get a mortgage on attractive terms?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only if you have a good credit record, a moderate amount of debt in relation to your income and the ability to fully document your income. That last requirement is fairly easy for people who work for a salary and have had the same employer for more than two years, but it can be tough for self-employed people with incomes that vary substantially from year to year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A borrower with a strong credit score of 740 or higher (on the scale of 300 to 850) and the ability to make a down payment of at least 20% could get an interest rate of about 5% with no origination fees on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, says Lou Barnes, a mortgage banker in Boulder, Colo. But if your credit score is 680, the rate jumps to about 5.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who can't make a down payment of at least 20% generally are being funneled into loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration. That means paying extra fees for the FHA insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowing costs are steeper at the high end of the housing market. For so-called jumbo loans -- those above $729,750 in areas with the highest housing costs or $417,000 in places with the lowest costs -- interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages last week averaged 5.95%, according to HSH Associates, a financial publisher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10. Should I invest in foreclosed homes?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Probably not. A lot of investors chase these properties, and only the most experienced know how to deal with all of the pitfalls. Homes auctioned at trustee or sheriff sales are sold on an as-is basis, and there is no provision for an inspection before you take ownership. If after buying you find out that termites have been treating the floor joists as an all-you-can-eat buffet, that is your problem. You must pay for the full price within a day or two, so you need a lot of cash or access to special short-term loans for investors that come with interest rates of around 18%. This is a pursuit best left to people with a lot of time, nerve, cash and knowledge of the local market.</p>
