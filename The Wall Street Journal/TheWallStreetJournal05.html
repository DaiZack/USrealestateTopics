<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices continued to rise in October as demand increased for homes but tight inventories nationwide limited supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures prices for typical single-family homes across the country, rose 6.2% in the 12 months ended in October, up slightly from a 6.1% year-over-year  increase reported in September.  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/home-price-growth-gained-momentum-in-september-1511877892]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle reported the highest increase in home prices, jumping 12.7% year-over-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the rising cost of buying a home outpaces inflation, the pace of home sales has slowed. Sales of existing homes dropped 6.1% from March through September. Sales bounced back 8.4% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Since home prices are rising faster than wages, salaries, and inflation, some areas could see potential home buyers compelled to look at renting," said David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have said they aren't concerned about losing potential homeowners to the rental market [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-grew-robustly-in-october-1511795319?tesla=y] because prices are continuing to rise so briskly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think there's been a near-term shift in rental demand," said Zillow Senior Economist Aaron Terrazas, noting that the homeownership rate increased slightly during the third quarter, according to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Terrazas said home-building has begun to ramp up in recent months though it isn't enough yet to match demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-city index gained 6% year over year, up from 5.7% in September. The 20-city index gained 6.4%, up from 6.2% the previous month. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected the 20-city index to rise 6.2% in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate for a 30-year mortgage touched 3.94% last week, down from a year earlier when it averaged 4.3%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-over-month, the U.S. Index rose 0.2% in October before seasonal adjustment, with the 10-city and 20-city index rising by the same amount. After seasonal adjustment, each of the indexes rose by 0.7%.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax overhaul is expected to create winners and losers in housing markets across the U.S., dealing a blow to high-cost coastal regions but potentially fueling demand in the middle of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law caps the amount of property and state income tax filers can deduct, a provision that hits states like New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and California especially hard. It also limits the size of a loan on which homeowners can deduct mortgage interest to $750,000, down from $1 million, which could put a dent in pricey markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, real-estate agents and economic-development officials in less-expensive states believe they can benefit if the tax-law changes encourage people to reconsider their home address.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At some point this draws attention to the cost gap in high-cost areas and growing areas with growing resources like Raleigh, Austin and Charlotte," said Scott Hoyt, a real-estate agent in North Carolina. "That's going to be a boon."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At peak impact in the summer of 2019, home prices in Essex and Union counties in New Jersey and Westchester County in New York could be about 10.5% lower than they would have been without the tax bill, according to Moody's Analytics. For roughly 80% of counties in the country, the effect of the bill on home prices is likely to be negative, the firm estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some markets could see a slight boost to their economies and to home prices thanks to the bill, including parts of North Carolina, Alabama, Nebraska, Indiana and Tennessee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They don't get nailed by the elimination of the [state and local tax] deduction, but they do benefit in the change from the standard deduction and some of the manufacturers benefit from the lower marginal rates for businesses," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zandi cautioned the changes are modest. Even areas likely to see an additional increase in home prices are expecting a boost of around 1%. Overall, the national impact is likely to be negative. "What this is going to do is it's going to throw a wet blanket on [the housing market]. It's still going to move forward, but more slowly," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax overhaul[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/trump-cheers-gop-tax-overhaul-slams-democrats-who-opposed-it-1513795294] is expected to create winners and losers among housing markets across the U.S., dealing a blow to high-cost coastal regions but potentially fueling demand in places in the middle of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law caps the amount of property and state income taxes[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/what-the-tax-bill-does-to-homeowners-1513737287] filers can deduct, a provision that hits places like New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and California especially hard. It also limits the size of a loan on which homeowners can deduct mortgage interest to $750,000, down from $1 million, which could put a dent in pricey markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, realtors and economic-development officials in less-expensive states believe they can benefit if the tax-law changes encourage people to reconsider their home address.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At some point this draws attention to the cost gap in high-cost areas and growing areas with growing resources like Raleigh, Austin and Charlotte," said Scott Hoyt, a realtor in North Carolina. "That's going to be a boon."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At peak impact in the summer of 2019, home prices in Essex and Union counties in New Jersey and Westchester County in New York could all be about 10.5% lower than they would have been without the tax bill, according to Moody's Analytics. For roughly 80% of counties in the country, the effect of the bill on home prices is likely to be negative, the firm estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some markets could see a slight boost to their economies and to home prices thanks to the bill, including parts of North Carolina, Alabama, Nebraska, Indiana and Tennessee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They don't get nailed by the elimination of the [state and local tax] deduction, but they do benefit in the change from the standard deduction and some of the manufacturers benefit from the lower marginal rates for businesses," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Zandi cautioned, the changes are modest. Even areas that are likely to see an additional increase in home prices are looking at a boost in the 1% range. Overall, the national impact is likely to be negative. "What this is going to do is it's going to throw a wet blanket on [the housing market]. It's still going to move forward, but more slowly," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People are already migrating from high-cost states to lower-cost areas as home prices and rents in large urban centers skyrocket and it becomes easier for people to work remotely. The tax law is likely to accelerate that trend, economists said. Idaho, Nevada and Utah saw the largest percentage growth in population in the country from July 2016 to July 2017, according to U.S. Census data released this month. New York, New Jersey and California, meanwhile, ranked below the top 20 for percentage growth in population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the tax impact is likely to be felt more by businesses deciding to expand operations in lower-cost states, viewing local taxes as an even greater hindrance.</p>

Meanwhile, an affluent homeowner with an expensive home in Raleigh would pay just over $10,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A homeowner in similar circumstances in Chicago would pay about $12,000 in property and state income tax, while one in the same circumstances in Nashville would pay about one-quarter that much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Mosley, a Redfin real-estate agent in Nashville, said he has one client moving from Chicago who fast-tracked his closing to just three weeks, out of fear he will take a hit on his tax bill next year because of the cap on state and local tax deductions. Tennessee has no state income tax, although it does level a tax on investment income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the tax law is merely likely to nudge those already considering moving to a cheaper state. Most homeowners are likely to make other sacrifices before they uproot their lives over a modestly larger tax bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Bellone, county executive of Suffolk County on New York's Long Island, said he worries the law will hurt the area economically in the form of lower home values and less consumer spending. Long Island has already struggled to retain younger residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The cost of living is high and that's something we're always grappling with to try to keep people in the region and keep young people in the region. This is really a devastating blow to all those efforts," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Felicia Fleitman, a 34-year-old who owns a consulting business, Savvy Hires, that helps companies create internships and apprentice programs, said she and her husband pay about $10,000 on property taxes and another $5,000 on state income taxes for their 1,100-square-foot home on Long Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple has two children and Ms. Fleitman is pregnant with a third. She said they would make sacrifices such as taking fewer career risks or buying fewer toys for their children, in order to stay in their home close to family and friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At the end of the day, we're just going to have to figure it out and come up with the money, which means that other things might have to give a bit, which stinks," she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">FBI</span> said Friday that it found a martyrdom letter and several guns in the home of a former Marine who allegedly planned to carry out a Christmas Day attack on a San Francisco tourist destination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everitt Aaron Jameson, 26 years old, was arrested and charged Friday with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. It wasn't clear if Mr. Jameson had an attorney.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes rose in November to the highest level in more than a decade as the housing market appears poised to end 2017 on a high note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales increased 17.5% in November [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/new-homes-sell-at-best-pace-in-more-than-a-decade-1513954916] from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000, the Commerce Department said Friday. It was the strongest pace since July 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These are the exact kinds of new-home sales numbers the market has been desperate for the past few years," said Zillow Senior Economist Aaron Terrazas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is showing strength across the board. Existing-home sales, which make up the vast majority of the market, jumped 5.6% in November from the previous month to reach the highest level since December 2006, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the reason for the increase in new home sales was a downward revision in the previous month's sales pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, new homes sales account for a relatively small share of total home purchases and data can be volatile month-to-month. November's increase comes with a margin of error of plus or minus 10.4 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, new-home sales appear poised to end the year higher than last year. Through November new home sales were up 9.1% in 2017 from the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hurricanes in Florida and Texas and wildfires in California may also have provided a boost to new-home sales. The strongest growth in sales was in the West, where sales jumped 31.1% compared with a month earlier, and the South, where they were up 14.9% from the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think a lot of these people are buying homes to replaces ones that they've lost," said Tendayi Kapfidze, chief economist at LendingTree, an online loan information site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders increasingly are selling homes before they even start building them, an indication of strong demand and inventory shortages. About 35% of homes sold in November weren't yet started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales pace, there was a 4.6 month supply of new homes on the market at the end of November, the slimmest inventory since July 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is just another sign that the U.S. housing market has a supply problem and not a demand problem," said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at home-tracker <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of inventory is helping push up prices. Friday's report showed the median sale price for a new home sold in November was $318,700, up from the $315,000 median price in November 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect both new and existing home sales to continue improving but caution there could be a pullback in the early months of next year because of tax legislation signed into law Friday morning [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/trump-signs-sweeping-tax-overhaul-into-law-1513959753].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rob Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said he expects a slowdown in sales growth next year stemming from changes to the tax code that offer fewer incentives for homeownership [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/gop-tax-overhaul-makes-homeownership-less-appealing-1513765800]. Mr. Dietz expects new home sales to rise 5% in 2018 to more than 650,000—less than had the tax overhaul not happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The longer-run trends will remain in place but there are going to be transition effects due to tax reform," Mr. Dietz said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned U.S. homes rose in November to the strongest pace in more than a decade, a sign of solid momentum in the housing sector as 2017 draws to a close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales increased 5.6% in November from the prior month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.81 million, the strongest reading since December 2006, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected sales would rise a more modest 0.7%, to a 5.52 million annual rate last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Faster economic growth in recent quarters, the booming stock market and continuous job gains are fueling substantial demand for buying a home as 2017 comes to an end," NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in November were up 3.8% from a year earlier, and grew on the month in all regions except in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While part of the gain in sales could be catch-up after sale closings were delayed by late-summer hurricanes, the housing market appears poised for continued growth in 2018, said Ian Shepherdson, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The fundamentals remain favorable, with mortgage rates still low and the labor market very strong," Mr. Shepherdson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a 3.4-month supply of homes on the market at the end of the month, the lowest in records that go back to 1999. The supply shortage is, in turn, driving prices higher, Mr. Yun said. The median sales price in November was $248,000, up 5.8% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is highly likely that existing sales would have been much stronger in 2017 if supply had been more abundant," said David Berson, Nationwide chief economist.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Christina Rexrode </div><div>540 words</div><div>20 December 2017</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Republican tax-code overhaul would reduce or eliminate some of the benefits of homeownership that Americans have come to expect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners in areas with high home prices and hefty property taxes could be most affected, but real-estate agents, home builders and housing-industry groups say the effects would be felt by a wide swath of borrowers. This is because the tax bill could make existing homeowners less willing to move up to bigger homes. That, in turn, could make it harder for renters to enter the housing market -- a prospect that is already difficult, given the lower-than-normal supply of homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are a few ways the current bill could affect the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage interest deduction is the sacred cow of American homeownership. Current law allows homeowners to deduct the interest on mortgages of up to $1 million. The tax bill would cut that to $750,000 for future home purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This could make homeowners with mortgages of more than $750,000 less inclined to move, since it would cause them to lose part of their tax shield. (That is assuming they are moving to a comparable or more-expensive house.) Or, in some cases, they might not be willing to pay as much for a new home, a factor that could weigh over time on higher-end home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only about 4% of purchase mortgages made this year were for more than $750,000, according to housing-research firm Attom Data Solutions. But a few regions would get hit hard. In Manhattan, for example, 64% of purchase mortgages made this year were for more than $750,000, according to Attom. In San Francisco, that proportion is 58%, and the surrounding counties of San Mateo, Marin and Santa Clara register between 44% and 55%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Black Knight Inc</span>., a mortgage data and technology firm, calculates there are about 684,000 active mortgages with current balances over $750,000. Black Knight estimates that about 107,000 loans expected to be made in 2018 would fall above the $750,000 cap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, homeowners would no longer be able to deduct the interest they pay on home-equity debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overhaul would also curb how much homeowners can deduct for paying property taxes. Current law allows taxpayers to deduct state and local income or sales taxes, and also property taxes. Under the new bill, the amount that taxpayers can deduct per return for state income or sales taxes, as well as for property taxes, is capped at $10,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could be a jolt to taxpayers who already pay high property taxes. The median property tax bill in the U.S. is about $1,740, according to data company <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, and only three counties -- all in the New York City area -- have median property tax bills above $10,000. But dozens of other counties have median property taxes above $5,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Westchester County, the median property tax bill is nearly $14,000, the highest in the country.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">October permits were revised up to a 1.316 million rate from a 1.297 million rate. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated they were revised down. (Dec. 19, 2017)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—U.S. housing starts rose last month to the highest level in more than a year, driven by gains in single-family home building in the South and West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 3.3% in November from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.297 million [http://www.census.gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf], the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Residential building permits, which can signal how much construction is in the pipeline, fell 1.4% to an annual pace of 1.298 million last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 3.1% decrease for starts and a 2.3% decline for permits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month's gains were buoyed by new single-family construction, which grew to the highest level in a decade. Single-family building in the South and West both reached their highest monthly rates since July 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts in October, which rose after being held down by hurricane effects in September, were revised down to a 1.256 million annual pace from an initial estimate of 1.290 million. Permits, which tend to be more reliable, were revised up to a 1.316 million rate from a 1.297 million rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-starts data are volatile from month to month and can be subject to large revisions. Looking past monthly volatility, starts in the first 11 months of the year were up 3.1% from the same period in 2016. Permits during this period increased 5.8% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New residential construction hit a post-recession high in October 2016, and has moved sideways since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home building has held this year near the highest levels since before the recession began, while construction of larger buildings eased as the market for new condominiums and apartments has cooled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, multifamily construction of buildings with two or more units ticked down 1.6% from a month earlier, while permits for this same category declined 6.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">​Separate data ​showed home builders are optimistic about the housing market. Home-builder confidence in the market for newly-built single-family homes rose this month to the highest level in more than 18 years, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said Monday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regarding Edward Pinto's "To Spur Homeownership, Stop Subsidizing It" (op-ed, Dec. 5): The thought that homeownership can be increased by devaluing all homes is an idealistic and completely impractical premise. With respect to housing, the current U.S. tax code has existed for 100 years and as a result has been institutionalized. It is baked into the fabric of the U.S. economy. Entire industries are built around the housing market, and material changes have unintended consequences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pinto recommends that we devalue housing across the board believing that if something is cheaper, more people will own it. He fails to mention the massive disruption such an across-the-board devaluation would have on the U.S. economy. A general decline in the value of homes, which the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> and others believe would range from 5% to 15%, would be catastrophic. We don't have to theorize because we have real data: the great housing recession of 2006. A second devaluation of all homes would be massively disruptive and would likely plunge the U.S. economy into another housing recession. Academics like Mr. Pinto enjoy classroom theoretical exercises and what-if planning. What they don't like are the facts, as they get in the way of their good story. Destroying home values for hardworking U.S. families who still haven't fully recovered from the last recession is a very bad idea.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Mitchell and Nick Timiraos </div><div>1028 words</div><div>1 December 2017</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy is headed into the final stretch of 2017 powered by one of the sturdiest periods of growth in its nine-year expansion, a vigor that is helping drive stock-market indexes to new highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday jumped 331.67 points, or 1.39%, to 24272.35, crossing the 24000 threshold just 30 trading days after passing 23000. Consumer spending, home sales and business investment are among several recent indicators exhibiting economic strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Not only do I think the economy's in good shape today, I think the economic expansion is going to continue for some time," New York Fed President William Dudley said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are also cheering the prospect of more economic fuel in the form of potential tax cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending, a key ingredient in economic growth, grew 0.3% in October from the prior month after rising 0.9% -- the quickest pace in eight years -- in September, the Commerce Department said Thursday. The spending figures suggested the economy entered the fourth quarter growing at a slightly slower pace than in previous months but still well above the roughly 2% annual average pace of the overall expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross domestic product grew at a 3.1% annual rate in the second quarter, 3.3% in the third, and many economists estimate it is growing between 2.5% and 3% in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last two economic expansions were derailed when asset prices overheated -- tech stocks in the late 1990s and real estate in the mid-2000s. Investors aren't fretting about that at this point. An index of market volatility, dubbed the "fear gauge," has been hovering near its lowest levels on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The booming stock market has lifted household spirits and in turn their willingness to spend more and save less. The national saving rate stood at 3.2% in October, just a touch above September's 3% figure, which was the lowest rate of savings since November 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But robust growth raises complex questions about the $1.4 trillion tax cut the Senate began debating Thursday. Republicans see strong consumer spending as an outgrowth of improved business and household confidence associated with the prospect of lower taxes, in addition to lighter government regulation. Others wonder whether tax cuts are needed at all when the economy is already picking up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think what they're doing is just throwing a big can of gasoline on a fire that's already quite hot, and it just doesn't make any sense," said Ian Shepherdson, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists warn that low saving rates give Americans less of a financial cushion should the economy hit a rough patch down the road. A range of other measures in recent days add to evidence of an economy still enjoying a good run of momentum. New-home sales rose in October to a 10-year high, and contracts signed for existing homes rebounded strongly in October after several months of declines. Consumer confidence has also risen for five straight months to a 17-year high, according to the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">October's spending increase reflected higher spending on goods like prescription drugs, as well as on services like airfares for foreign travel, the Commerce Department said. It added that spending and income data in recent months have been skewed by hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which tore through Texas and Florida this summer. The Commerce Department said the storms affected the data for August and September, though it couldn't say by how much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shepherdson said if the economy performs over the next year as it did this year, unemployment will likely fall from the already low level of 4.1% in October to 3.5% at the end of 2018, a rate not seen since the late 1960s. Fed officials project that the economy can safely handle unemployment of between 4.5% to 4.8% without stoking a bout of crippling inflation. A rate much below that could entice the Fed to raise interest rates more quickly than planned to prevent an unwanted pickup in inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't really need fiscal stimulus from an economic perspective," Mr. Dudley said at an event in New York on Monday. In the interview with The Wall Street Journal Thursday, he added, "this is an above-average economic environment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, broad measures of inflation are restrained, a sign the economy isn't overheating. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, excluding volatile food and energy categories, rose 1.9% in October at a three-month annual rate, according to Thursday's Commerce Department report. That is below the Fed's 2% inflation target. It stood 1.4% higher than one year earlier. Overall prices, including food and energy, were up 1.6% from a year earlier in October, down from September's 1.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen told lawmakers on Wednesday that the Fed wouldn't necessarily try to prevent the economy from growing faster, as long as it doesn't stir inflation in the process. She wouldn't say whether she believed changes in the tax code would do that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Look, we welcome strong growth. The Fed is not trying to stifle growth," Ms. Yellen told Congress's Joint Economic Committee. "We're worried about trends that could push inflation above our 2% objective."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> expect the tax plan to boost growth by 0.2 percentage point in 2018 next year, raising GDP to 2.5%, and that the unemployment rate will fall to 3.7% next year and 3.5% by the end of 2019, which would be the lowest level since 1969.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the unemployment rate headed to such a low level, "if Congress stimulates the economy more, the Fed will have no choice but to respond to that with more hiking than they would have done," said Derek Kaufman, a former senior executive at hedge fund <span class="companylink">Citadel LLC</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home price growth accelerated in September as a strong economy boosted demand for homes and supply failed to keep pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which covers the entire nation, rose 6.2% in the 12 months ended in September, up from a 5.9% annual increase in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The September figure was the fastest annual rate since June 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The existing-home market has presented a mixed picture in recent months of robust price gains coupled with lackluster sales activity. Inventory is especially constrained in the bottom third of the market, where prices are growing twice as quickly as the top third, said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In order for the market to be healthy you would want to see more stable supply," Ms. Gudell said, along with renters converting more easily to buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales increased 2% in October from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.48 million, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday. But sales dipped 0.9% from the same month a year earlier, the second consecutive decline on an annual basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new-home market has shown more strength. Sales of newly built homes rose 6.2% in October, the second consecutive month of strong gains, driven by strong demand for starter homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wage growth, low unemployment and easing standards for mortgage credit all have helped drive housing demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But builders haven't kept pace, and new-home construction remains well below the historical average. That is likely to continue pushing prices up quickly in coming months, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most economic indicators suggest that home prices can see further gains," said David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. "One dark cloud for housing is affordability—rising prices mean that some people will be squeezed out of the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-city home price index increased 5.7% over the year, up from 5.2% in August. The 20-city index jumped 6.2%, up from 5.8% the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sixteen cities experienced accelerating annual price increases in September from the previous month and eight cities recorded record highs. Seattle reported the largest annual gain, at 12.9%, followed by Las Vegas at 9% and San Diego at 8.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While affordability is a growing concern in large coastal cities, many areas remain well below the previous peaks, and continued price gains are welcome news for many homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's still a lot of Americans that are still reeling from the credit crisis," said Sam Dunlap, a senior portfolio manager with <span class="companylink">Angel Oak Capital Advisors</span>, a mutual-fund firm specializing in mortgage-backed securities. "Not all of these cities have had such robust gains like Seattle and San Francisco. There are still areas that have a lot of room to run."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-over-month, the U.S. Index rose 0.4% in September before seasonal adjustment, while the 10-city increased 0.5% and the 20-city index edged up 0.4% from August to September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After seasonal adjustment, the national index rose 0.7% month-over-month, the 10-city index experienced a 0.6% increase and the 20-city index rose 0.5%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar edged slightly higher Tuesday, supported by strong U.S. data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, was recently up 0.3% at 86.66.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers are more confident than they have been since the early 2000s, data from the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> showed Tuesday. Its index of U.S. consumer confidence[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/consumer-confidence-remains-at-a-17-year-high-1511882286] increased to 129.5 in November from 126.2 in October, which was already the highest level in 17 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/home-price-growth-gained-momentum-in-september-1511877892]rose 6.2% in the 12 months ended in September, up from a 5.9% annual increase in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have been keeping a close eye on U.S. data, as they try to determine how aggressively the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> will be able to raise rates next year. Higher rates make the dollar more attractive to yield-seeking investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The dollar stands to benefit from any improvement in the data that confirms the view that the economy is accelerating into the year-end," said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at <span class="companylink">Commonwealth Foreign Exchange</span>, in a note to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. currency, as measured by the WSJ Dollar Index, is down around 7% this year.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes rose in October for the second consecutive month, driven by demand for entry-level homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes, a small portion of all U.S. home sales, increased 6.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 685,000 in October from the previous month, the Commerce Department said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The advance supports a longer-term positive trend in the market. In all, new-home sales were up 8.9% in the first 10 months of the year from the year-earlier period and have jumped nearly 19% in the past 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entry-level buyers are driving much of the activity. Sales of homes in the $200,000 to $300,000 range increased more than 35% in October from a year earlier. Demand for starter homes is expected to fuel continued sales growth if builders can ramp up construction quickly enough. Builders face a number of challenges, such as high land costs, labor shortages and rising material prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is starving for affordable new homes, and builders cannot and will not ignore this hungry market," said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at home listings website Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes that have been sold but haven't yet started construction jumped by 30% in October from a year earlier. That suggests housing starts should rise strongly in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The fact that you've got gains in homes sold but not started construction is confirmation that there is simply not enough inventory," said Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. "The markets that are going to grow are ones where builders can add that entry-level product."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is good news for the U.S. economy overall because it indicates consumers have confidence in their economic prospects and will be making ancillary purchases, such as new flooring, furniture and landscaping, in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"New-home sales are a leading indicator, and the jump in October sales are leading the economy higher as we finish out the year," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at financial-services firm MUFG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But inventory shortages remain a constraint. At the current sales pace, there was a 4.9-month supply of new homes on the market at the end of October, the lowest level this year and down from nearly six months in the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for a new home sold in October was $312,800, up from $302,800 in October 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">October's robust growth comes after new-home sales jumped 14.2% in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, U.S. new-home sales remain about half what they were during the last boom. In 2005 more than 1.2 million new U.S. homes were sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes, which makes up the bulk of the U.S. housing market, slipped 0.9% in October from a year earlier, the second consecutive decline on an annual basis, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said last week.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sluggish in October</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in areas hit by hurricanes, including Houston, Orlando and other major markets, showed gains from previous months, helping to drive the monthly increase in October, according to Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist.</p>

The Chancellor of the Exchequer is expected to offer a gloomy prognosis for public finances in Britain, after the official economic forecaster said feeble productivity in the U.K. is likely to weigh on growth and tax receipts in the years ahead.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—U.S. housing starts rose last month to the highest level in a year, a sign that builders are getting back on track after hurricanes lashed the southeast and dampened residential construction activity in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts increased 13.7% in October from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.29 million, the Commerce Department said Friday. Residential building permits, which can signal how much construction is in the pipeline, jumped 5.9% to an annual pace of 1.297 million last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists cautioned against being too optimistic about the uptick, however, because it was driven largely by a 37% increase in multifamily starts, which tend to be highly volatile. Single-family starts rose 5.3% from the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">October starts for single-family homes in the South were at the highest level in a decade, increasing 16.6% from September. September starts were held down by the effects of hurricanes Irma and Harvey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a little bit of a dead cat bounce after the hurricanes," said Terrell Gates, CEO of Virtus Real Estate Capital, a private-equity firm that invests in housing and other assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-starts data are volatile from month to month and can be subject to large revisions. Looking past monthly volatility, overall starts in the first 10 months of the year were up 2.4% from the same period in 2016. Single-family starts were up 8.4% through October, while multifamily starts were down 9.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those trends are likely to continue as multifamily developers pull back due to a glut of new luxury construction and single-family builders continue to ramp up in response to low unemployment, increasing wage growth and demand from millennials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All these things are suggesting we'll continue along this growth trend in 2018, with the wild card that we have to see how tax reform will play out," said Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dietz said tax reform could have a significant impact on home building, especially in high-cost markets such as California. The House bill proposes to halve the amount of mortgage interest that is deductible to $500,000 and the Senate bill would eliminate the deduction for state and local taxes, both of which could depress demand [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/republican-tax-plan-would-slam-california-housing-market-1510137001] for more expensive homes. Provisions in the House bill also could significantly reduce affordable-housing production [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/affordable-housing-production-under-threat-in-tax-overhaul-proposals-1510785380] and have an impact on multifamily construction overall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New residential construction hit a postrecession high in October 2016 but has trended lower since, and remains far below the levels reached during the bubble years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labor shortages, rising land costs and increasingly restrictive land-use regulations have helped create a shortage of inventory that is driving up home prices much more quickly than wages and inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors reported last month that homes are spending just three weeks on the market, the shortest period in three decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have to really put these numbers into the big picture. People are scrambling for housing right now and it's become really tough, and even tougher in the last year," said Robert Frick, corporate economist with <span class="companylink">Navy Federal Credit Union</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts rose in October for single-family construction and increased for multifamily construction. Permits last month were up for buildings with multiple units and rose for single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separate data showed home builders are feeling better about the market this fall. Home-builder confidence in the market for newly built single-family homes rose this month to the highest since March, when the index touched a post-housing-bubble peak, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home builders are building, and that signals greater confidence in the economy ahead," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at financial firm MUFG.</p>

Scana Proposes to Lower Rates After Ending Nuclear Plant Project; Company also plans to absorb some of the construction costs</span>
</div><div class="author">By Allison Prang </div><div>591 words</div><div>16 November 2017</div><div>13:29</div><div>WSJ Pro Bankruptcy</div><div>RSTPROBK</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2017, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Scana Corp</span>. said Thursday it will absorb some of the construction costs from its failed nuclear plant project [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/scana-halts-south-carolina-nuclear-power-project-1501524763] and roll back rates for South Carolina utility customers, as it faces pressure from state regulators and consumer groups over its handling of the development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After collecting more than a billion dollars from customers to develop the nuclear plant it has since stopped working on, <span class="companylink">Scana</span> subsidiary <span class="companylink">South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Co</span>. proposed reducing rates by 3.5%, or $90 million a year, over five years. The reduction, the company said, would result in monthly bill deductions of over $5 and return rates to March 2015 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A South Carolina state official said earlier this year that customers had paid $1.4 billion for the plant, which comes to about 18% of a typical residential bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've heard our customers' frustrations about paying for a power plant and having nothing to show for it," said Keller Kissam, <span class="companylink">SCE&amp;G</span>'s incoming president and chief operating officer, in prepared remarks. "This proposal gives customers additional power generation while also lowering rates for customers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Scana</span> also said its shareholders will absorb the net nuclear construction costs—pegged at $2.9 billion—through lower earnings over 50 years. It also plans to write off $810 million in costs related to the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't clear whether the proposal would alleviate the political pressure the company faces to pass on more of the costs to its shareholders. <span class="companylink">Scana</span>'s plan requires approval from South Carolina's utility regulator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">South Carolina Public Service Commission</span> didn't immediately return a request for comment on <span class="companylink">Scana</span>'s plan. But the state's governor weighed in, calling it unsatisfactory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The governor asked <span class="companylink">Scana</span> over a month ago to stop charging customers for this failed project and to give them their money back. Today's proposal does neither, and that's completely unacceptable," said Brian Symmes, a spokesman for Gov. Henry McMaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Scana</span> shares rose 4.8% in morning trading, but are down 37% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company stopped its plans to build the V.C. Summer Nuclear Station this summer. Utility company <span class="companylink">Santee Cooper</span> had anticipated the total cost of building the plant would be around $25.7 billion, more than double the $11.5 billion the plant was estimated to cost in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since July the company has faced questions from local political officials about when it knew the project was in trouble, and why it didn't take steps sooner to avoid cost overruns. Federal officials have also been probing the project and how the company handled it. The company has pledged cooperation with subpoenas it received from the U.S. Attorney's Office in South Carolina and the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, <span class="companylink">Scana</span> announced its chairman and chief executive officer, Kevin Marsh, would leave the company at the end of year. Scana Finance Chief Jimmy Addison will become CEO Jan. 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SCE&amp;G</span> also said Thursday it would buy a natural-gas plant for $180 million to make up 40% of the power the nuclear plant was supposed to provide. The Gaston, S.C., plant is owned by Columbia Energy LLC. <span class="companylink">SCE&amp;G</span> has been the plant's main customer, the company said, and it aims for the deal to be approved next year.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto, Christina Rexrode and Chris Kirkham </div><div>1299 words</div><div>2 November 2017</div><div>18:12</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House Republicans on Thursday unveiled a tax bill [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/republicans-stick-with-big-corporate-tax-cuts-in-house-bill-1509629510]that would reduce or eliminate virtually all of the tax incentives of homeownership, promising to reshape an industry that accounts for nearly one-sixth of the U.S. economy and drives the biggest financial transaction most Americans make in their lifetimes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed legislation would cut in half the size of loans that qualify for deductions of mortgage interest, to $500,000 from $1 million. At the same time, it would nearly double the standard tax deduction, to $24,400 for married couples in 2018, ensuring that only a tiny sliver of homeowners, primarily in the priciest housing markets, will continue to itemize their returns to capture the break.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill also appears to eliminate the mortgage interest deduction for second homes and further limits, for top earners, a break on capital gains from real estate sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's one step removed from the worst-case scenario, and that's a small step," said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Compass Point Research &amp; Trading, a Washington, D.C.-based investment bank. "It is basically the sum of all [the industry's] realistic fears."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of home builders and residential real-estate brokerages tumbled after the bill was unveiled. The S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF ended the day down 2.5%, while shares of luxury builder Toll Brothers Inc. fell about 6% and shares of <span class="companylink">Realogy Holdings Corp</span>., a residential brokerage company, shed about 7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage lenders worried the bill could hurt their business and weren't clear on how the loan refinancing market might be affected. Housing-industry groups such as the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> and <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> came out in opposition to the bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The corporations are getting a major tax cut, and it's getting paid for by the equity in American homes," said Jerry Howard, chief executive of the NAHB.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The legislation "threatens home values and takes money straight from the pockets of homeowners," said NAR President William E. Brown, a California Realtor. "Tax hikes and falling home prices are a one-two punch that homeowners simply can't afford."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One silver lining for the housing industry: the bill would retain a deduction for property taxes, albeit with an annual cap of $10,000, which is a blow to homeowners in high-tax states like New York and New Jersey. In all, roughly 3.7 million U.S. households paid more than $10,000 a year in property taxes in 2016, including 30.5% of owner-occupied homes in New Jersey, according to an analysis of census data by the <span class="companylink">NAHB</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even without the $500,000 cap, the mortgage interest deduction already was hobbled by a plan to increase the standard deduction. The <span class="companylink">Tax Policy Center</span>, a nonpartisan group headed by a former Obama administration tax official, previously estimated that the blueprint released earlier this fall could reduce the share of taxpayers who claim the deduction to 4% from 21% currently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally just 2.8% of mortgage loans have a balance greater than $500,000, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span>. Of the 7.7 million single-family-home mortgages made last year, 548,000—or 7%—were over $500,000, according to the trade publication Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the changes come at a sensitive time for the housing industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home prices rose on an annual basis in 92% of 177 U.S. metropolitan areas in the third quarter, according to a Thursday report from the <span class="companylink">NAR</span>. That was the largest share of metros notching price gains in more than two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the gains were driven by a shortage of homes for sale. At the end of the third quarter, there were 1.9 million homes on the market, 6.4% fewer than the same period last year. The average supply [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/supply-shortage-in-u-s-sends-home-prices-higher-1509639587]during the third quarter was 4.2 months, down from 4.6 months a year earlier. Economists say six months is typical of a balanced market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have affordability issues as it is. If you make it more difficult for people to put money toward the house, or take away the economic benefits of them owning a house, it really, really could be a major problem," said Rick Sharga, executive vice president of Ten-X, an online marketplace for real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Howard of the <span class="companylink">NAHB</span> said the tax overhaul could cause a housing recession because of a potential drop in home values. States with high housing costs, including California, where more than a third of homes are valued above $500,000, would be particularly hard hit, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Republicans have always claimed that they don't want to pick winners and losers in the economy," he said. "They are clearly picking large corporations over small businesses, and they are clearly picking wealthy Americans over the middle class."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the $500,000 cap on the mortgage interest deduction would apply only to loans made after Nov. 2, which protects existing homeowners. But experts said that is likely to exacerbate the current stagnation in the housing market[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/stuck-in-place-u-s-homeowners-hunker-down-as-housing-supply-stays-tight-1509274802].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners in high-cost cities like New York, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and parts of Miami are less likely to trade up to larger, more expensive homes if they know that means losing the protection on the mortgage interest deduction, which in turn makes it difficult for younger buyers to enter the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In those expensive markets that already have an inventory crunch it's probably going to make the situation worse," said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. He said this is likely to drive up prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage lenders, meanwhile, worried the tax bill could weaken their businesses by taking away some of the incentives of homeownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill also could have an impact on the refinancing market. Lenders said it appeared that the lower, $500,000 deduction would also apply when existing mortgages were refinanced, which could discourage borrowers from refinancing even if they have a relatively high interest rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some lenders said the bill also appeared to curb the tax benefits of cash-out refinances by eliminating the deductibility of the portion of the mortgage that exceeds the value of the debt being rolled over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics said that could hurt the economy because borrowers often tap equity to pay for their children's college or to renovate their homes, which boosts consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For high-income households, the bill phases out a rule in existing tax law that excludes the first $250,000 in profits from a home sale, or $500,000 for a married couple, from capital-gains taxes. The change would affect home sellers with incomes exceeding $250,000 for individuals or $500,000 for married couples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">NAR</span> and <span class="companylink">NAHB</span> were split in their early strategy on tax reform. The Realtors remained behind the mortgage interest deduction, while the builders for the first time in 30 years said they were open to changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may have weakened their negotiating position earlier in the process, experts said. "The unfortunate industry split that led to the push for a mortgage tax credit, I think left the entirety of the mortgage [interest deduction] out on a limb," Mr. Boltansky said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now both groups are united in opposition to the bill. "There's going to be a ferocious fight ahead and the housing industry is going to be a central player in that fight," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices climbed and sales declined during the third quarter as a chronic supply shortage continued to disrupt the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home prices rose on an annual basis in 92% of 177 U.S. metropolitan areas, according to the third quarter report from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. That was the largest share of metros notching price gains in more than two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gains are being driven mainly by a lack of inventory of homes for sale, which is also helping to depress sales activity. Existing-home sales slipped 3.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.39 million in the third quarter from the second quarter and are just 0.2% higher than the same period a year earlier, according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising incomes, strong consumer confidence and the progression of the millennial generation into homeownership[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/more-people-think-renting-is-a-better-deal-than-buying-1508842803] are helping drive demand for housing. But housing supply is continuing to contract, especially in areas with the strongest economic growth, tipping the market out of balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Normally such broad-based strength in housing markets across the country would be considered good news. "In this current housing shortage environment, it is not good news. It is hindering affordability," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of the third quarter, there were 1.9 million homes for sale, 6.4% less than the same period last year. The average supply during the second quarter was 4.2 months, down from 4.6 months a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is some indication that the most extreme price gains are beginning to slow. In the third quarter, 19 metro areas experienced double-digit price increases, down from 23 in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, more metro areas posted price gains in the third quarter than in the second, when price gains were reported in 87% of metro areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most expensive metropolitan areas in the U.S. remained concentrated in California. The median price of a previously built single-family home in San Jose was $1.165 million, while San Francisco's median price was $900,000 and the Anaheim-Santa Ana metro area posted a median of $790,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price in the Western region of the U.S. increased 7% to $373,700 in the third quarter compared with a year earlier. Prices climbed 4.1% in the Northeast, 5.6% in the Midwest and 5.5% in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">California Association of Realtors</span> reported separately on Thursday that 28% of California households could afford to purchase a home at the median price of $555,680 in the third quarter, down from 29% in second-quarter 2017 and 31% in the third quarter of 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"California is at a critical point where because of the housing situation companies may decide to expand elsewhere," Mr. Yun said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices grew at their strongest rate in more than three years in August, an indication that despite slowing sales in recent months, demand for housing remains strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which covers the entire nation, rose 6.1% in the 12 months ended in August, up from a 5.9% year-over-year increase reported in July. That was the biggest annual increase since June 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-city index gained 5.3% over the year, up from 5.2% in July. The 20-city index gained 5.9%, up from 5.8% the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of home sales has slowed in recent months, while price growth has continued to accelerate. Economists said that suggests the market is suffering from a lack of homes for sale, while demand remains strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are growing much faster than wages and rents, an indication that such gains are likely unsustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is way above any other indicator in the economy," said Susan Wachter, professor of real estate at the <span class="companylink">Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania</span> "It is simply the longest price increase we've every experienced of this magnitude."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Current levels of inventory of homes for sale are near their lowest point in 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have struggled to keep up with increased demand for homes, as they face labor and land shortages and rising material costs. U.S. housing starts decreased in September for the fifth time in six months and remain significantly below historic norms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price gains have been widespread. Nineteen of 20 cities in the Case-Shiller indices reported price gains from July to August. Meanwhile, home prices in Seattle rose 13.2% over the last year, followed by Las Vegas with an 8.6% annual increase and San Diego with a 7.8% increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-over-month, the U.S. Index rose 0.5% in August before seasonal adjustment, while the 10-city rose 0.5% and the 20-city index rose 0.4% from July to August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After seasonal adjustment, the national index rose 0.5% month-over-month, while the 10-city and 20-city indexes also both rose 0.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes declined on an annual basis for the first time since July 2016, that National Association of Realtors said earlier this month, a sign that the inventory shortage is taking a toll on the market. Sales fell 1.5% from the same month a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home prices will not rise forever. Measures of affordability are beginning to slide, indicating that the pool of buyers is shrinking," said David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates have begun to rise, which should ultimately begin to put a damper on price gains. The average rate for a 30-year mortgage touched 3.94% last week, up from a year earlier when it averaged 3.47%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Interest rates are starting to rise. That's generally the beginning of the end of a housing expansion," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Falconhead Capital</span> is exiting its investment in GPSi Holdings LLC, agreeing to sell the telematics company to strategic buyer <span class="companylink">Ingersoll-Rand PLC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sarasota, Fla.-based GPSi provides global-positioning-system technology to help fleet managers track motor coaches, charter buses, school buses for schools and universities and other line-service operators. The company also manages transportation tracking for golf clubs and resorts operators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falconhead formed GPSi in 2009. The company was created through the acquisition and three-way merger of <span class="companylink">GPS Industries Inc</span>., ProLink Systems Inc., and a series of assets owned by David Chessler, who was named the chief executive of the company, according to a news release at the time.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The acquisition by <span class="companylink">Ingersoll-Rand</span> is expected to strengthen the company's telematics portfolio, according to a news release.

</p><div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">U.S. News: Homeowners Renovate And Stay Put --- Tight market, high prices make it harder to move and hinder renters looking to buy</span>
</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto and Christina Rexrode </div><div>1066 words</div><div>30 October 2017</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite rising home prices and a growing economy, U.S. homeowners' mobility rate is stuck at a 30-year low as many opt to stay put rather than move to pursue job opportunities or trade up for more space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median duration of owners in their homes in 2017 was 10 years, according to data to be released todayby the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. That matched last year's level, which, along with 2014, was the highest since the <span class="companylink">NAR</span> started tracking the data in 1985.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans aren't moving in part because inventory levels have fallen near multidecade lows and home prices have risen to records. Many homeowners are choosing to stay and renovate, in turn making it more difficult for renters to enter the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of inventory "is like not having enough oil in your car and your gears slowly come to a grind," said Sam Khater, deputy chief economist at data company <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stagnant housing market means people aren't moving to places where they can get better jobs, or within their own metropolitan area to get closer to their jobs or better schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, there is about four months of supply of homes on the market at all price points, much less than the six months economists say is normal. The crunch is most acute for midprice homes, with only about three months of supply, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Khater said he and his wife have decided to stay and renovate their home in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., rather than move to a bigger place with a backyard for their daughter, because he can't find anything for less than $1 million that would fit their needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 4.7% in September, the Commerce Department said, and remain about 40% below the 50-year average, which is especially unusual considering the economy and job markets are expanding strongly. In September, sales of previously owned homes declined on an annual basis for the first time since July 2016 as the shortage of homes continues to take a toll on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of new-home construction has helped create a bottleneck in the market in which owners of starter homes aren't trading up to newly built homes, which tend to be pricier, in turn creating a squeeze for millennial renters looking to get into the market. Economists said baby boomers also aren't in a hurry to trade in the dream homes they moved into in middle age for condominiums or senior living communities because many are staying healthy longer or want to remain near their children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those factors have led Americans to pour record sums into home renovations. Spending, already at record levels, is expected to continue accelerating, according to data released this month by Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies. Total outlays on renovations are expected to grow 7.7% annually in the third quarter of 2018, up from 6.4% in the third quarter of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mobility rates, which were largely stable from the 1950s through the late 1970s, have been in slow decline for decades, according to Mr. Khater. "It's a bit of a mystery as to why," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason appears to be a growing disparity between home prices in the richest states versus those in the poorest ones, fueled by increasing land-use regulations that make it more difficult to build in wealthier places, according to recent research by Daniel Shoag, an associate professor of public policy at Harvard University and Case Western Reserve University, and Peter Ganong, an assistant professor at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, economists said they would have expected at least a temporary uptick as the housing and job markets recovered, and people are more likely to move in search of better job opportunities or because their homes are worth more so they can afford to upgrade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is supposed to be an economic recovery, where people are supposed to [trade up] their homes," said Sanjiv Das, CEO of Caliber Home Loans Inc., the eighth-largest mortgage lender in the U.S. by loan volume, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. "And we haven't seen that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason for the undersupply: Investors snapped up single-family homes during the downturn and converted them to rentals. While some industry observers thought they would sell them as soon as home prices recovered, a booming rental market has meant that most have held on to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appetite for Risk</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wanes After Crash</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans have shown a more cautious attitude toward homeownership in the wake of the housing crash nearly 10 years ago that has made many unwilling to gamble on buying bigger, more expensive homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's that feeling that 'We survived this last downturn, we're maybe halfway to getting this home paid off, why should we take on another mountain of debt just to get into this bigger home?' " said Daren Blomquist, senior vice president at the housing-research firm Attom Data Solutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blomquist, who lives in southern California, recently went through that same thought process with his wife, when they considered but ultimately decided not to get a bigger place for their three children. "It's easy to sell," he said. "The challenge is finding a new home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jacob and Stacy Loftin in Somerville, N.J., considered moving to a new home that might be less work than their century-old colonial but were put off by the ferocity of the competition. Some of the houses that did go on the market were snapped up by investment firms that have pushed up prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think maybe we missed the window to move if we're going to move to a house within our budget," Mr. Loftin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, they added an extra half-bathroom, built a small deck and redid their kitchen, after deciding the renovation would be easier to stomach than a move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm always a little anxious about buying what you don't know," said Mr. Loftin, an operations administrator at an insurance company. "You can never really trust what you're getting."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite Hurricanes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. new-home sales in September recorded the largest single-month increase since 1992, a sign the market remains resilient despite two major hurricanes and a continuing inventory shortage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes -- a narrow slice of all U.S. home sales -- increased 18.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 667,000 in September from the previous month, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—U. S. new-home sales in September recorded the largest single-month increase since 1992, a sign the market remains resilient despite two major hurricanes and a continuing inventory shortage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes—a narrow slice of all U.S. home sales—increased 18.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 667,000 in September from the previous month, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That put new home sales at the highest level since October 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales remain well below the peak of 1.3 million recorded in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both new and existing home sales have been weak through much of the spring and summer, as a shortage of inventory and rising prices have helped keep many buyers out of the market. This report suggests that trend might be reversing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's certainly a surprise. The economy still very much has good life and the outlook is expected for continued growth here late in this economic expansion," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at financial firm MUFG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report was greeted with widespread surprise by economists, most of whom expected modest declines in sales in September due to hurricanes in Florida and Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales data can be volatile and subject to revision. The September increase, which comes with a 19 percentage point margin of error, is still likely to be revised down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most surprisingly, the report said that home sales in the south, which includes Florida and Texas, jumped by 25.8%. An aging population moving to warmer climes and relatively affordable home prices have helped make the south a growth market, and that might have outweighed the effect of the hurricanes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales reflect contracts signed and can be less vulnerable to weather than housing starts, which declined 4.7% in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The south was supposed to be storm ravaged. Instead the south is powering home sales to a new record from the housing bubble collapse," Mr. Rupkey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists cautioned that rising home prices could begin to put a damper on the market. Strong demand and limited supply have helped push prices up and rising labor and material costs due to hurricane recovery efforts are likely to exacerbate the trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders reported on their most recent earnings calls that they already are beginning to see shortages of workers and materials such as drywall. They are attempting to control costs by stockpiling materials and leaning on longstanding relationships with contractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If FEMA starts writing checks and we are paying a framer $5 and FEMA funds something and they are offered $10, you are going to be in a chase for that contractor," Jeff Mezger, CEO of KB Home, said on an earnings call late last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales pace, there was a five-month supply of new homes on the market at the end of September, down from six months in August. The median sale price for a new home sold in September was $319,700, up 5.2% from August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At some point housing affordability will become a larger issue," said Rob Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes, which represent the bulk of the U.S. market, rose 0.7% in September from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.39 million, the National Association of Realtors said last week, indicating continued weakness in that segment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While economists were skeptical of this month's new-home sales numbers, they point to a strong growth trend. Year-to-date sales have risen 8.6%. New home sale rose off a weak base in August, when sales fell 3.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It represents a return to the solid growth trend that's been in place for quite a while," Mr. Dietz said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One key feature: the land trust will retain ownership of the land under the homes and control how much the homes are resold for, preserving affordability for generations to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Community land trusts are still in their infancy in major cities, and it remains to be seen how effectively a nonprofit can compete to buy land[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/new-york-developer-raises-fund-for-affordable-housing-1505214000], especially in a place like New York City where many land deals are closed quickly and in cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The creators of the New York land trust said it could generate 250 units over the next couple of years, which would make it one of the largest in the U.S., according to Melora Hiller, chief executive of Grounded Solutions Network, which works with community land trusts across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of the foreclosure crisis, many places shifted focus away from promoting low-income homeownership after that became a path to financial ruin for many during the era of easy mortgages. Roughly two-thirds of New Yorkers rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as real-estate prices[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/tax-overhaul-threatens-affordable-housing-deals-1490094003] have climbed, housing groups said they began to search for alternatives that would give people more control over their living situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Coming out of the foreclosure crisis, we spent a lot of time and still do spend a lot of time figuring out how to keep homeowners in their homes. We started seeing that there was very little daylight between recovery and gentrification," said Christie Peale, executive director of the Center for NYC Neighborhoods, one of the organizations behind the creation of the trust, dubbed the Interboro Community Land Trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a growing body of evidence that homeowners fare better financially than renters over time. The median net worth of homeowners increased by 15% between 2013 and 2016, while the incomes of renters or other non-homeowners fell 5% during the same period, according to a September report by the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Whatever savings they could have put together for a deposit on a home or an apartment is being exhausted by rising rental costs," said Bob Annibale, global director of Citi Community Development and Inclusive Finance, which has contributed $1.2 million toward the Interboro Community Land Trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the owner of the land, the trust then has the ability to restrict the price at which owners can resell their units, keeping them below market rate in perpetuity. This differs from many of the current models for affordable homeownership, where regulatory agreements that keep homes or apartments affordable often expire after a couple of decades, freeing the owners up to sell their homes at market rates and potentially turn a substantial profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Peale said the trust is likely to focus on areas like southeast Queens, the Bronx and southeast Brooklyn and to include a significant component of single-family homes, as well as co-op apartment buildings. Many of the homes will be affordable to those making 80% of New York's median income, or just over $76,000 for a family of four</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We feel that we have to act now and acquire land at a cheap price," Ms. Peale said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hiller of Grounded Solutions said the trust has the potential to be a national leader because of the number of large organizations involved. The additional founding members include some of the city's most prominent affordable-housing nonprofits, such as <span class="companylink">Habitat for Humanity New York City</span>, the Mutual Housing Association of New York and the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board. The trust has also received $500,000 from New York City and Enterprise, an affordable housing group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said there has been growing interest in the land-trust model as both home prices and rents have risen rapidly, creating an affordability crisis in many cities across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Since the foreclosure crisis we've seen a steady increase in the number of communities trying to prevent displacement," she said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>705 words</div><div>24 October 2017</div><div>07:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A growing percentage of renters believe it is cheaper to rent than to buy a home, which helps explain why the homeownership rate remains persistently low nearly a decade after the housing crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A boom in apartment construction in the past few years has caused rent increases to begin to level off in many U.S. cities, while home price gains have accelerated over the past year. As a result, roughly 76% of renters in August said they believe renting is more affordable than owning, up from 65% in September 2016, according to survey results from <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> expected to be released Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We talk virtually every day about how renting is becoming less and less affordable. I think the answer is just that housing is becoming less and less affordable and renting is the more affordable of the two," said David Brickman, executive vice president and head of <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> Multifamily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data from the <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> survey and another by the <span class="companylink">National Multifamily Housing Council</span> and Kingsley Associates suggest there isn't likely to be a shift toward owning from renting among old and young alike, due to financial reasons and those of lifestyle and preference. Landlords are likely to see this as welcome news that a widespread shift toward owning isn't coming anytime soon. The data also indicate the persistent shortage of homes for sale on the single-family side is depressing the appetite for homeownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> survey, the view that renting is more affordable increased significantly across all age groups. Some 76% of millennials said renting is an affordable option, up more than 10 percentage points from a year ago. Roughly 82% of baby boomers said they view renting as a more affordable option, up 11 percentage points from a year ago. And the share of Generation Xers who see renting as more affordable jumped to 75% from 56%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National home prices increased by 5.9% over the year ending in July, according to the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index. Figures for August are due out next Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People appear to be aware of how rising home prices are affecting their local markets. Some 58% of respondents for the <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> survey said they believe home prices are higher than they were a year ago, while 54% said they believe that rents have increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Multifamily Housing Council</span> survey found that baby boomers might be more likely than millennials to rent to avoid the costs of homeownership, perhaps because they have spent decades repairing broken dishwashers and replacing leaking roofs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"By the time you hit 65 you're fed up with all those costs," said Rick Haughey, vice president of industry technology initiatives at the <span class="companylink">National Multifamily Housing Council</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey found that just 7% of all renters 25 to 34 years old said they choose not to own a home because of the maintenance costs, while 28% of those over 65 years old cited that as the reason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top reason renters across all age groups said they prefer to rent was convenience and flexibility, with 23% of respondents citing that as the reason, while 18% said they don't have enough saved for a down payment. The third most common reason cited was that they had recently moved and are exploring neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That suggests the trend toward renting is being driven less by necessity and more by preference and lifestyle, which means it might not reverse anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> survey found a marked decline in those who said they are actively working toward homeownership, to 14% in August 2017 from 21% in January 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't see a big demographic shift toward homeownership," Mr. Brickman said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This story has been updated to include a comment from Airbnb. (Oct. 23, 2017)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could the use of <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> increase home prices and rental rates?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new, not-yet-published working paper suggests the popular home-sharing service might do just that. The researchers looked at rents and home prices in the 100 largest metro areas in the U.S. between 2012 and 2016. They found that a 10% increase in <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> listings leads to a 0.39% increase in rents and a 0.64% increase in house prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That may sound minuscule, but between 2012 and 2016, rents rose by about 2.2% annually [on average in the 100 areas], so a 0.39% increase in that context isn't very small at all," says Edward Kung, an assistant professor of economics at the University of California Los Angeles and one of the study's authors. The same is true for home prices, which rose by an average of about 4.8% annually in the 100 areas, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal spoke to Dr. Kung about the study. The other co-authors are Davide Proserpio, an assistant professor of marketing at University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business, and Kyle Barron, research assistant at the <span class="companylink">National Bureau of Economic Research</span>. Below is an edited transcript of the conversation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effects of sharing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: Why are policy makers concerned about <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>'s effect on home prices?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DR. KUNG: There is an affordability crisis. In an earlier study, we found the number of people spending more than 30% of their income on rent increased by 9 percentage points over 14 years, from 30% in 2000 to 39% in 2014. And it isn't just renters. In 2015, about a third of Americans spent more than 30% of their income on rent or mortgages, according to a study[http://www.jchs.harvard.edu/research/state_nations_housing] done by the Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies. Anything pushing up rent and home prices is a public concern, and it's really the impetus for many cities wanting to regulate <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: How does <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> affect home prices and rental rates?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DR. KUNG: We hypothesize <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> takes supply out of the long-term rental market, which caters to residents looking to rent permanent homes, and reallocates it to the short-term rental market, which caters to tourists or other temporary visitors. This reduces the supply of long-term rental units and increases the price for residents looking for long-term housing. Home prices rise with rents. And above and beyond that simple relationship, <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> enables homeowners to generate income from their property, making their homes even more valuable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[A spokesman for Airbnb says, "<span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> makes housing more affordable—countless families depend on <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> to pay their rent and stay in their homes—and in an opinion survey, 95% of economists and housing experts said they don't believe home sharing has a significant impact on rents. The authors of this study agree that home sharing can provide important economic benefits for families and support smart rules that allow home sharing to continue."]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: Is it surprising that <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> has an effect on rental rates and home prices?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DR. KUNG: We didn't know what to expect. Some people would say <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> isn't a big enough player to affect house prices and rental rates, but if a local resident looks for a long-term rental unit they will find that about one in 13 potentially available homes are being placed on <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> instead of being made available as a long-term rental. And that's the median. For neighborhoods in the 90th percentile, where the number of <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> listings is very high, it's almost one for one, where for every one unit listed on <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>, you see one unit listed on the long-term market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>'s effect on home and rental prices differed by neighborhood, even between neighborhoods within the same city. How come?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DR. KUNG: We think owner occupancy is a big reason for that. We find that <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> listings are more highly correlated with higher house prices and rental rates in neighborhoods with fewer owner-occupiers. That is one of the key points in our analysis, and it's consistent with the hypothesis. The reasons <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> increases rental rates is that nonowner occupiers [landlords] are taking homes out of the long-term market and putting the units into the short-term market. In contrast, if owners are living in their home, they are less likely to rent it to long-term tenants. Instead they are just using <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> to rent their home while they are away on vacation or share an extra room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: How does <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> affect vacancy rates?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DR. KUNG: In cities where we saw <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> growth, we also saw a decrease in vacant homes for sale or rent. But we saw an increase in the short-term rental market for seasonal or vacation homes, which are classified by the U.S. Census as vacant since they are not in use year round. So again, we saw a reallocation of housing stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should we regulate?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: What are the policy implications of this paper?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DR. KUNG: Policies should try to stop the conversion of properties from long-term rental units to short-term rental units. But regulators should not restrict home sharing for people who would not have made their homes available to long-term renters anyway, such as: owner-occupiers; using <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> to share unused rooms or rent their home while they are away; or vacation-home owners, who intend to use their house for part of the year. For these people, home sharing allows them to more fully utilize their homes by generating an additional income stream. The challenge is to fully understand the intent of the homeowner.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of previously owned homes declined on an annual basis for the first time since July 2016, suggesting a chronic shortage of homes for sale is beginning to take a bigger toll on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September's existing-home sales fell 1.5% from the same month a year earlier, the National Association of Realtors said Friday, the third consecutive month of lackluster results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a continuation of this theme of low inventory really being the burr in the saddle of this housing market," said Daren Blomquist, senior vice president of communications at ATTOM Data Solutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a monthly basis, existing-home sales edged up by 0.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.39 million in September from August. But the small uptick was largely due to a modest rebound in Houston home sales, which were up 4% after a large drop in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September's sales pace was still the second-slowest in the past year. In August, existing-home sales fell to the lowest level in a year, mostly due to a sharp drop in home sales in Houston in the wake of Hurricane Harvey and a shortage of homes on the market. The weak performance over the past couple of months belied strong job and wage growth numbers and increasing demand from first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's an uptick over a really weak month," said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at home-search website Zillow. "Given…a really low August, you would expect September to be a little bit stronger, which leaves me with a lackluster, eh."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cindy Hamann, chair of the Houston Association of Realtors, said some Houston sales that were set to close in late August were delayed until September, which helped boost last month's numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"October is really going to be the telltale of what's going on," she said. Agents she talks to are still busy, she said, and homes are selling along as they are priced well. "I want to say that we're going to keep on keeping on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes in Houston sold at 96% of their estimated market value in August, according to ATTOM, the lowest percentage since January 2014, indicating that sellers might have started discounting to get their homes to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hurricane Irma, which battered parts of Florida in September, took a toll on home sales. Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, said sales there dropped by roughly 20%, but it wasn't enough to drag down numbers for the south overall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the U.S., inventory has been tight recently, in part because of lackluster home construction, which has contributed to a run-up in home prices. The median price of homes sold last month rose to $245,100 in September, up 4.2% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales pace, it would take 4.2 months to exhaust the supply of homes on the market. That is down from 4.5 months during the same period last year, reflecting the tightening housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun said the shortage of homes could last into next year. "Housing starts are only incrementally slowly rising, but because of the hurricane and the rebuilding efforts there... the construction workers will be rebuilding, and that means less workers available for new home construction," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists are skeptical, however, that a lack of inventory is the sole explanation for sluggish home sales. "It's a late-cycle economy," said Doug Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae. Slowing sales "happen in housing before there's a downturn."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a common fallacy that the mortgage deduction saves people money ("Mortgage Break Faces Irrelevancy[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/gop-tax-plan-would-keep-the-mortgage-break-but-threaten-irrelevancy-1508146200]," U.S. News, Oct. 17). It does not. It simply lowers the borrower's effective interest rate. On a cash-flow basis, a mortgage-free homeowner will always have more after-tax money than one with a mortgage.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Xi Jinping delivered a speech Wednesday that marked the opening of the Communist Party congress. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that his speech was Thursday. (10/18)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING—China's economy expanded at a robust 6.8% pace in the third quarter, meeting market expectations, as traditional growth drivers such as manufacturing and exports gained steam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong showing is welcome news for Communist Party leaders gathering for a twice-a-decade conclave in Beijing [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chinas-xi-feeds-expectations-for-a-lengthy-reign-1508333178]. To prepare for the event, which is expected to strengthen President Xi Jinping's reign over the nation for years to come, various levels of government have for months mounted massive efforts to keep the world's second-largest economy on an even keel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third-quarter pace slowed from 6.9% in the second quarter, though it puts the full-year target set by the leadership for growth of about 6.5% well within reach. Adding to a sense of optimism in official circles, China's central-bank Gov. Zhou Xiaochuan said just days ahead of the political conclave that second-half growth could reach 7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increased industrial activity and higher commodity prices were major reasons behind the strong growth. The latter, partly a result of policies to cut overcapacity, benefited state-owned manufacturers in particular. That is because the capacity cuts led to the closures of many private firms, especially in industries like coal and metals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recovering global demand also helped, giving China some economic breathing room, which has meant an economic slowdown that many expected hasn't materialized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production, a main gauge of manufacturing activity, rose 6.6% in September from a year earlier, according to data released Thursday by the National Bureau of Statistics. Retail sales jumped 10.3%, though the pace of growth slowed from the first half of the year, indicating consumers have grown wary of opening their wallets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say increased output was largely driven by state firms that have seen a sharp rebound in profits this year. In the first nine months of 2017, according to official data, large state firms controlled by the central government—which dominate China's smokestack industries—saw their profits jump 18.4% from a year earlier to 1.1 trillion yuan ($167 billion).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still-solid property investment, despite government efforts to cool the housing market, has also increased demand for steel, furniture and other materials, helping to lift profits in the manufacturing sector. Meanwhile, a global economic recovery has helped Chinese exporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This doesn't mean China has entered a new cycle of accelerating growth, economists warn. To keep near-term growth steady, Beijing has delayed fixing some of its long-running problems, such as industrial overcapacity and excessive debt. That, in turn, economists say, means risks for a prolonged slowdown in the economy are rising, not declining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists also have long questioned whether the government's statistics reflect the true state of the economy. The Conference Board, a nonprofit research firm, estimates that China's growth rate is around 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech Wednesday that marked the opening of the party congress, Mr. Xi laid out a sweeping plan to transform China into a strong global power that stresses expanding the party's control over the economy and all other corners of the nation. But unlike his predecessor, who said China's national income would double over a decade, Mr. Xi outlined his vision without specifying a broad target for economic expansion, even as he reaffirmed Beijing's commitment to development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The omission indicated "a subtle de-emphasizing of specific growth targets," said UBS China economist Wang Tao. Ms. Wang projects that the government will soften its growth target slightly for next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to tackle the economy's long-term ills, some analysts say, Beijing may need to significantly lower its annual growth targets. So far, there have been few signs that the government is willing to accept the trade-off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent survey by China Beige Book, a data provider that tracks China's economy, of more than 3,000 Chinese companies shows that from July through September, hundreds of coal, steel, aluminum and copper companies reported a sixth straight quarter of overall capacity rising, not falling. Meanwhile, after a brief slowdown in credit growth, Chinese banks handed out more loans last month, indicating Beijing's preference for near-term stability over any drop in economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This will not persist," said Yukon Huang, a former country director at the World Bank in China, referring to the near-term recovery of China's economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Long-term growth depends on more fundamental drivers such as productivity growth," said Mr. Huang, who is now a senior fellow at the <span class="companylink">Carnegie Endowment for International Peace</span>. "That hasn't happened yet."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>599 words</div><div>18 October 2017</div><div>11:22</div><div>WSJ Pro Central Banking</div><div>RSTPROCB</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2017, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts decreased last month for the fifth time in six months, as builders felt the brunt of construction delays as well as labor and material shortages caused by hurricanes in Florida and Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Housing starts fell 4.7% [https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf] in September from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.127 million, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Single-family starts declined 15.3% in the south, driven by the effects of hurricanes Irma and Harvey, which caused builders to delay beginning new projects and made labor and material significantly more expensive in those areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential building permits, which can signal how much construction is in the pipeline, fell 4.5% to an annual pace of 1.215 million last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-starts data are volatile from month to month and can be subject to large revisions. Looking beyond monthly volatility, starts in the first nine months of the year were up 3.1% from the same period in 2016. Permits during this period increased 5% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said housing starts are likely to remain depressed for several months due to the recent hurricanes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dietz still anticipates that housing starts for the year overall are likely to be up modestly from last year, due to continued gradual improvement in new single-family construction activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Over the next few months I wouldn't expect large declines but movement along that new normal," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dietz said builders across the country are seeing shortages and rising costs of materials, which are being redirected to Houston and Florida. The rebuilding effort also is likely exacerbating an existing shortage of workers in the sector. The number of unfilled construction jobs in August reached its highest level since February 2007, according to a <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> analysis of Labor Department data released last week. The number of unfilled jobs is expected to increase in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction is one of the industries most affected by weather-related events, along with mining and hospitality, according to Jed Kolko, chief economist at job-search website Indeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New residential construction reached a postrecession high in October 2016 but has eased slightly since and remains well below levels reached in the years preceding the 2008 financial crisis. Even as single-family home construction begins to pick up, multifamily construction is declining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far this year, single-family home starts are up 9.1%, while starts for buildings with five or more units have declined by the same amount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you actually look into the numbers a bit closer it is not all doom and gloom; [it is] mostly because of a fall in multifamily homes," said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. "Single-family starts look somewhat healthy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> on Tuesday said its index that measures confidence in the market for new single-family homes rose to 68 in October from 64 in September, slightly below the postrecession peak touched in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This month's report shows that home builders are rebounding from the initial shock of the hurricanes," said Home Builders Chairman Granger MacDonald, a builder and developer from Kerrville, Texas. "However, builders need to be mindful of long-term repercussions from the storms, such as intensified material price increases and labor shortages."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Simon Constable </div><div>351 words</div><div>8 October 2017</div><div>22:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PNC U.S. Household Economic Stress Index is something that smart investors might want to watch. As the name suggests, it is a measure of how stressed U.S. consumers are on an aggregate basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a variation on the misery index," says Stuart G. Hoffman, senior economic adviser at PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The so-called misery index, around since the 1970s, is the percentage inflation rate plus the percentage unemployment rate. Any increase in either adds to the average level of household misery. The PNC stress index, or HESI, brings in another factor. From the sum of the percentage unemployment and inflation rates, it subtracts the percentage move in home prices as measured by the Case-Shiller home-price index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate is often the largest asset of households, so an increase in home prices indicates a rise in wealth, explains Mr. Hoffman. He says the sweet spot is when the stress index is between 0 and 10. The index measured 1.1 in the third quarter, based on estimates of inflation and house prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A move above 10 indicates significantly higher inflation, and/or unemployment and possibly falling home prices, all of which would add to stress levels. But if the index moves below zero—which is possible if housing-price increases accelerate from the recent rate of around 6% a year—there could be a different problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could mean the housing market is overheating, he says, something last seen in the bubble before the financial crisis.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- California will enact new fees on real-estate transactions and ask voters to approve a $4 billion bond measure on next year's ballot, among other measures aimed at creating more affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bond measure and the new fees -- intended to pay for new affordable-housing units and homes for veterans -- are part of a package of 15 bills that California Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law Friday to address the state's housing shortage. California rents and home prices have soared, and homeownership has plummeted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other measures in the package include a provision to streamline housing requirements in cities that aren't building to state-mandated goals, incentives for cities to plan new neighborhoods and prod local governments to get shovels into the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts say California's high housing costs have crimped economic productivity, increased poverty rates, increased crowding and lengthened commute times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California has long been considered by home builders and developers one of the most difficult places to build because of lengthy and complicated permit processes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brown acknowledged the role local and state regulations have played on the state's housing shortage, saying efforts to improve building safety, increase environmental standards and shape neighborhood character has resulted in "a lot of rules."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slow pace of construction in the city's major coastal markets -- where demand for homes is highest -- has led to prices soaring in recent years, as low inventory has fueled bidding wars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Angeles County, the median home price for a single-family home was $575,130 in August, while in San Francisco the median home price was $1.38 million, according to data from the <span class="companylink">California Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price for a single-family home in California hit $565,330 in August, according to the association's data. That is a 131% increase from the bottom, hit in February 2009, during the depths of the last housing downturn.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other measures in the package include a provision to streamline housing requirements in cities that aren't building to state-mandated goals, incentives for cities to plan new neighborhoods and prod local governments to get shovels into the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts say California's high housing costs have crimped economic productivity, increased poverty rates, increased crowding and lengthened commute times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California has long been considered by home builders and developers one of the most difficult places to build because of lengthy and complicated permit processes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In signing the measures Friday, Mr. Brown acknowledged the role local and state regulations have played on the state's housing shortage, saying efforts to improve building safety, increase environmental standards and shape neighborhood character has resulted in "a lot of rules."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All these rules were passed by people like you, let's face it," Mr. Brown told a crowd of mayors, lawmakers and other dignitaries gathered at an affordable housing project in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"City and state people did all this good stuff—energy efficiency, better insulation, more of this and more of that, you know, you name it—it's all good!" he said. "But as I always say, too many goods create a bad."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report in 2015 by the state legislature's independent analyst found that California has some of the most expensive housing markets in the U.S. largely because of the slow pace of development in high-demand coastal cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These coastal communities restrict new building through local ordinances, planning boards and voter initiatives, the 2015 report said. Costs are often higher, and high-density development is lower in these communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slow pace of construction in the city's major coastal markets—where demand for homes is highest—has led to prices soaring in recent years, as low inventory has fueled bidding wars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Angeles County, the median home price for a single-family home was $575,130 in August, while in San Francisco the median home price was $1.38 million, according to data from the <span class="companylink">California Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price for a single-family home in the state of California hit $565,330 in August, according to the association's data. That is a 131% increase from the bottom, hit in February 2009, during the depths of the last housing downturn, when foreclosures inundated the market. And August's statewide median home price is also just 5% below the $594,530 peak hit in May 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underscoring the uneven nature of the California housing market, an analysis by the data firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> found statewide sales of homes of more than $1 million hit an all-time high in the first quarter of this year while sales of homes under $500,000 slumped to a nine-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state also had four of the country's 10 most expensive rental markets in the third quarter, according to real-estate researcher Reis Inc. Average rent in San Francisco was $2,880; San Jose, $2,484; Orange County, $1,801; and Los Angeles, $1,797.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawmakers estimate they need to build 1.8 million new units of housing to meet population projections and household growth over the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As lawmakers deliberated over the measures in August, one of the sharpest sticking points was a fee of $75 to $225 onto some real-estate transactions to create a permanent source of funding for low-income housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans said the fee amounted to a tax increase and groups including the <span class="companylink">National Federation of Independent Business</span>, the <span class="companylink">California Mortgage Association</span>, the <span class="companylink">Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association</span> and some county governments opposed the fee. The $4 billion housing bond will require voter approval in November 2018.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based in Boca Raton, Fla., Host.net provides managed infrastructure services including co-location, cloud computing, storage, network transport, and transit and disaster recovery backup and support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Novacap in 2013 participated in a management buyout of Host.net. WSJ Pro Private Equity reported at that time that the transaction was co-led by Host.net co-founder and Chief Executive Jeffrey Davis and Novacap Technologies III LP, which closed with 165 million Canadian dollars (about $134.9 million) in 2008.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank Street Group served as 365 Data Centers' financing adviser for the deal and <span class="companylink">Greenberg Traurig LLP</span> served as its legal counsel. Crestline Specialty Lending provided the credit facility. Additional financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based in Norwalk, Conn., 365 Data Centers provides data-center services for carrier, content and cloud customers in New York and Buffalo, N.Y.; Chicago; Detroit; Indianapolis; Philadelphia; Nashville, Tenn; and Tampa, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An investor group led by Dublin-based private investment firm Chirisa Investments in partnership with Lumerity Capital, a Greenwich, Conn., private-equity firm, and Longboat Advisors LLC, an asset management firm, acquired 365 Data Centers, according to a late April news release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founded in 1981 and based in Longueuil, Quebec, Novacap has C$2.26 billion of assets under management. The firm focuses on two investment areas: industries; and technology, media and telecommunications.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-Home Sales</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Declined in August</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. new-home sales continued to fall in August, and the supply of available homes expanded. Purchases of newly built single-family homes fell 3.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 560,000 in August, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, the second straight monthly decline and hitting their lowest level since December. That was below the 591,000 sales pace that economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More broadly, new-home sales were up 7.5% in the first eight months of 2017 compared with a year earlier. Supply levels continued to rise in August. At the current sales pace, there were 6.1 months of new homes on the market at the end of the month, a figure that has crept up in recent months and in August hit its highest level since July 2014. The median sale price for a new home sold in August was $300,200.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department also said it corrected price data for new-home sales going back nearly three years, covering October 2014 through January 2017, to include previously omitted response data.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—U.S. new-home sales continued to fall in August, and the supply of available homes expanded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes fell 3.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 560,000 [https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf] in August, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, the second straight monthly decline and hitting their lowest level since December.

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto and Sharon Nunn </div><div>770 words</div><div>26 September 2017</div><div>15:52</div><div>WSJ Pro Central Banking</div><div>RSTPROCB</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2017, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A housing-inventory shortage is creating a seller's market, with strong demand pushing up prices even as the pace of home sales declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the imbalances shown in two separate housing-market reports released Tuesday are likely to worsen in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices are "pinching supply because a lot of people who would sell and trade up get worried about how they're going to do the trade-up part," said David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total housing inventory at the end of August declined 6.5% from a year ago [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-fell-in-august-1505916634], the National Association of Realtors said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, which covers the entire nation, rose 5.9% in the 12 months ended in July, up from a 5.8% year-over-year increase in June. Home prices hit a new record [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-home-prices-set-a-record-in-september-case-shiller-says-1480428083] last September, and the pace has generally accelerated since, as the inventory crunch has worsened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, purchases of newly built single-family homes fell 3.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 560,000 [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-declined-in-august-1506434817] in August, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, the second straight monthly decline and the lowest level since December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas, one of the cities the worst hit by the housing bust, had one of the strongest home-price performances in July, with a 7.4% increase in prices over the year ended in July. That put it behind only Seattle, which had a 13.5% annual price gain, and Portland, which experienced a 7.6% increase. Las Vegas prices still remain roughly 31% below their previous peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of available inventory appears to be the main drag on sales, but declining demand also might be a factor, as buyers grow weary of rising prices and fiercely competitive bidding wars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supply levels for new homes rose in August. At the current sales pace, there were 6.1 months of new homes on the market at the end of the month, a figure that has crept up in recent months and in August hit its highest level since July 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow, said that doesn't necessarily suggest the inventory squeeze is easing, because so much of the new construction is happening at the high end, while the critical issue for the market is the shortage of starter homes. The median sale price for a new home sold in August was $300,200.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Demand should be coming from millennials who now have jobs and are getting into their 30s. If they're facing this rapid increase in price, that may be holding back demand some," said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance Berson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the sales pace for both new and existing homes has slowed in the last several months, new homes still appear to be on track for modest improvement this year. New-home sales were up 7.5% in the first eight months of 2017 compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hurricanes Harvey and Irma also are likely to take a toll on the market in the coming months, delaying closings on new and existing homes. The Commerce Department said survey responses were lower than usual in areas of Texas and Florida affected by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve's recent decision to shrink its portfolio [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-keeps-december-rate-rise-on-the-table-eyes-slower-path-for-increases-1505930513] of mortgage and Treasury bonds purchased during and after the financial crisis also could help push mortgage rates up, which in turn could hurt affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nela Richardson, chief economist at Redfin, said higher mortgage rates could eventually slow home-price growth but it could take a while, in part because more affluent buyers and investors already are making significant down payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's going to take a while for homeowners to adjust their expectations of what price they should get," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other recent housing and construction readings have offered a mixed picture of a market with too few single-family homes and too many apartments in some areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes, which account for the bulk of U.S. homebuying activity, fell in August to the lowest level in a year because the limited supply of homes has driven up prices, squeezing many would-be buyers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Student-loan debt can't be discharged in bankruptcy unless a borrower files a separate court action known as an adversary proceeding and is able to prove "undue hardship," a high legal hurdle. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said student loans can't be discharged in bankruptcy. (Sept. 28)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Student-loan debt has been an obstacle for many potential home buyers. Now, <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. is trying to do something about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A subsidiary called Eagle Home Mortgage plans to introduce on Tuesday a program under which Miami-based <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> will pay off a significant chunk of the student loan of a borrower who purchases a home from them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing observers said other builders are likely to look to mimic the program, which could help lure more of the critical first-time-buyer segment into home purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such programs come with the risk, however, that the incentive drives up the price of new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Obviously there's a benefit to bringing more people into the home buying market. We're trying to design something here that supports affordability and creates that path to homeownership," said Doug Cropsey, a senior vice president at Eagle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Lennar</span> will make a payment to a buyer's student loans of as much as 3% of the purchase price, up to $13,000. The contribution doesn't directly increase the purchase price of the home or add to the balance of the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher Oquendo and Jeri Coate are planning to use the program to virtually eliminate their student debt. The couple, who are in their mid-30s, wanted a bigger house but were reluctant to take on more debt. Ms. Coate, who works in a notary's office, still had outstanding student loans from training she had done to be a medical administrative assistant and the couple had other unpaid bills as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We needed to get something bigger and upgrade but it was kind of a rough decision to make considering our status with bills and all," Mr. Oquendo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple are now in the process of closing on a <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> home in the city of La Marque, Texas, about 50 miles south of Houston, with two more bedrooms than they had before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The evidence is mixed as to whether student debt is acting as a meaningful barrier to homeownership. Most research suggests there is a much higher barrier for people who take out large loans and don't finish their degrees than there is for those with debt who earn a degree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing observers say that at minimum <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>'s program could help eliminate the significant psychological barriers that many feel to buying a home and taking on hundreds of thousands of dollars of more debt if they are already deep in the hole after college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study that was to be released Tuesday by <span class="companylink">NeighborWorks America</span>, a nonprofit that helps promote access to homeownership, found that one in four millennials said they have had to delay buying a home because of student debt. Half of millennials said they worry about their student loans all or most of the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer advocates are wary the program sounds too good to be true. They point to builder incentive programs during the last boom that helped inflate the price of new homes. Those programs allowed sellers to pay a portion of the buyers' down payment, which in turn tended to drive up the price that people could afford to pay for their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've had bad experiences when home sellers get involved in mortgages, particularly innovative mortgages," said Dan Immergluck, a professor at the Urban Studies Institute at <span class="companylink">Georgia State University</span>, who studies the housing market, mortgage finance and foreclosures. Mr. Immergluck said if the program drives up home prices, buyers without student loans will end up sharing the burden with those who do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage-finance company <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> has agreed to back the loans and will monitor the program to ensure that the value of student-loan payment isn't included in appraisals of the home, which in turn can help drive up values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is not without risk," said Jonathan Lawless, vice president of customer solutions at Fannie Mae. "Builders always want to provide more money and incentives for people to buy their homes. It has the potential to start distorting values."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lawless said Fannie is cautiously embracing new mortgage products that aim to make homeownership accessible for millennials. Fannie is also backing loans with down-payment assistance from Loftium, a Seattle-based company that will pay for up to $50,000 of the buyers' down payment if they agree to continuously rent out a room in their home on <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> for one to three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One other perk for borrowers: Student-loan debt can't be discharged in bankruptcy unless the borrower files a separate legal action and is able to prove "undue hardship," a rarely met standard, so getting rid of student debt early is preferable to paying it back slowly. But Mr. Lawless cautioned that efforts to make credit more easily available to millennials could end up exacerbating the shortage of homes if Fannie and others also can't come up with more ways to give builders incentives to build more starter homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As we pivot to next year, I think the thing that the industry needs to be careful about is we can't increase access and demand without increasing supply," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hurricane Harvey wreaked havoc on Houston and caused billions of dollars in property damage. One segment of the real-estate market, however, was less impacted: luxury homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the number of sales that closed fell markedly after the hurricane, both listing prices and sales prices fell only slightly, according to Multiple Listing Service data from the <span class="companylink">Houston Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median list price was down 3.1% and the median sales price was down 2.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For its analysis, the association looked at luxury-home listings, defined as $1 million and up, between Jan. 1 and Aug. 24, and compared data to listings between Aug. 25 and Sept. 11. In its analysis of home sales, the association compared sales between Aug. 7 and Aug. 24 to those between Aug. 25 and Sept. 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only a slight price decrease for luxury homes is predicted in the coming months, says James Gaines, chief economist at the Real Estate Center at Texas A&amp;M University. "We're expecting it to bounce right back up," he says. "For the most part, these [homeowners] were able to absorb it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agent Tim Surratt says he is fielding dozens of calls from homeowners who are considering listing their flood-damaged homes. He is also hearing from potential buyers looking to buy a fixer upper. "It's a juggling act," says Mr. Surratt, who is with Greenwood King Properties. Those looking to make a purchase are now more concerned about previous flooding, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Celebrity photographer Evin Thayer is keeping his $1.2 million contemporary home -- not damaged in the flooding -- on the market. He is betting that some buyers are eager to invest in a never-flooded home in Houston Heights, which sits on high ground. Despite regular showings, Mr. Thayer, who is working with Mr. Surratt, hasn't received any offers. "It's been quiet," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More buyers are thinking vertically these days, says Robert Bland of Pelican Builders, developer of the Wilshire, a luxury condo building under construction in the River Oaks District. Ten days after the storm, Mr. Bland signed four contracts for units ranging from $800,000 to $3 million. "In a twisted kind of way, it's been a plus," he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are Asked for Data</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A group of states investigating the opioid painkiller industry and the causes of widespread addiction stepped up its probe with a fresh demand for documents from drugmakers and distributors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">States including New York, California and Tennessee announced the moves, saying a group of 41 attorneys general served subpoenas on five manufacturers and demanded documents from the three companies that account for about 90% of the U.S. opioid distribution: <span class="companylink">AmerisourceBergen Corp</span>., <span class="companylink">Cardinal Health</span> and <span class="companylink">McKesson Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For millions of Americans, their personal battle with opioid addiction did not start in a back alley with a tourniquet and syringe," New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said. "They got hooked on medicine they were prescribed for pain or that they found in a medicine cabinet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">States including Ohio and Mississippi have filed lawsuits against drug companies, alleging they misrepresented the risks of their painkillers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representatives for the three distributors said they were cooperating with the investigation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of previously owned homes fell in August to the lowest level in a year, reflecting a shortage of properties on the market and a sharp drop in Houston home purchases because of Hurricane Harvey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales declined 1.7% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.35 million, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. That marked the third straight monthly drop, with continued declines expected in the coming months. Sales rose just 0.2% over the 12 months ending in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said that while demand remains strong, sluggish new construction and the reluctance of owners to put their homes on the market means there simply isn't much to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given the strength of the job market, favorable demographics and rock-bottom mortgage interest rates that make buying a home very affordable, the existing-home sales market should be roaring instead of whimpering," said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at real estate data provider Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales remain about 82% of what they would normally be, accounting for population growth, according to an analysis by home tracker <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year started strongly, with many economists predicting that rising home prices and a strengthening economy would prompt more sellers to put their homes on the market. Instead, the number of homes for sale at the end of August declined 2.1% from a month earlier and is 6.5% lower than a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had high hopes beginning the year but those have been smashed with a steel-toed boot," Ms. Gudell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Lawrence Yun, the Realtors' chief economist, now projects that sales for all of 2017 will decline from 2016, largely because of hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which have slowed sales in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hurricane Harvey packed an additional punch to the housing market in August, as buyers battling historic floods were in no position to close on home purchases. Sales in Houston plunged 25% in August, which was the first decline in almost a year, the <span class="companylink">Houston Association of Realtors</span> said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home sales were humming throughout the first three weeks of August, but the moment Harvey struck the region, everything came to a screeching halt," Cindy Hamann, chair of the Houston Association of Realtors, said in a release last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun estimated that overall sales would have been flat from the previous month without the hurricane effects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the impact of both Harvey and Hurricane Irma will continue to play out over the next couple of months. But most said they expect the Houston market to recover after that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We would expect to see a significant decline in home sales or closings for a couple of months, but if Katrina is any example it rebounds very strongly when things get back to normal," said Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American Financial Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others were less sanguine. "Once the damages are fully assessed, people are really going to start to realize how susceptible a large investment is going to be to these kinds of disasters," said Cheryl Young, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun said broader factors are weighing on the market. Inventory remains tight, in part because of lackluster home construction, and that has contributed to a run-up in home prices, pricing out potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of homes sold last month reached $253,500, up 5.6% from a year earlier. That was more than double the growth in Americans' incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has gotten easier to get a mortgage in recent months, but Sanjiv Das, chief executive of Caliber Home Loans, said he still encounters many would-be purchasers who struggle to get conventional loans because their credit was bruised during the recession.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could Tapering Cause Stress in Housing Market?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve signaled it is aiming to raise interest rates in December, which signals it is likely to maintain its march toward higher rates well into 2018, says Rick Rieder of BlackRock. Achieving its goal this year would give investors "a whole lot of confidence that they'll fulfill their 2018 projections as well," Rieder says. In terms of how markets respond to Fed tapering, Rieder's biggest concern is mortgage rates, because housing makes up such a large percentage of the economy. He says he doesn't expect any immediate stress in the housing market, but it's something he's watching for. (Daniel.Kruger@wsj.com)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank of NY Mellon Hasn't Received Venezuela Payment</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Bank of New York Mellon</span> has not received the $185 million interest payment on Venezuela's 2027 sovereign bond that was due last week, a source close to the fiscal agent says. The country has a 30-day grace period and has used this leeway in the past. Last week, Finance Minister Ramon Lobo repeatedly stressed the country's search for new payment mechanisms to avoid the U.S. financial system, presumably precisely to lower the risk of bounced payments. What is unclear is whether Venezuela has not paid because of temporary liquidity issues or because they are looking for alternative ways of payment. The Treasury today released a new set of guidelines for financial institutions for dealing with Venezuelan government. (anatoly.kurmanaev@wsj.com; @akurmanaev)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buffett Unconcerned About Home Capital Vote</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Home Capital Group</span> shareholders voted down a plan for <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway</span> to increase its stake in the company, but Berkshire chairman Warren Buffett doesn't mind. "I don't blame them," he told WSJ on Tuesday. "That was a tiny, tiny, tiny position," for Berkshire anyway. Berkshire in June acquired a 19.99% stake in Home Capital as part of a rescue package, with a second tranche of stock subject to shareholder approval. More than 88% of <span class="companylink">Home Capital Group</span> shares voted Sept. 12 against allowing Berkshire to expand its stake. (nicole.friedman@wsj.com; @NicoleFriedman)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial Stocks Rise After Fed Announcement</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising bond yields are helping lift financial stocks, even as the broader stock market turns lower after the Federal Reserve announcement. S&amp;P 500 financial stocks were up nearly 1% a few minutes before 3 pm, making them the best performing of the 11 sectors in the S&amp;P 500, which was down 0.2%. <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, and <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> were all up about 1.4%. Stocks of major banks tend to rise and fall with rates, since higher long-term rates can increase the difference between what they pay to borrow on a short-term basis and what they earn from lending on a longer-term basis. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was up 0.03 percentage point at 2.276% after the Fed suggested it was still on track to lift rates one more time before the end of the year.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early Estimates for Mexico Earthquake Insured Losses</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 7.1-magnitude earthquake in Mexico killed more than 200 people as dozens of buildings collapsed. While economic damages are still unknown, reinsurer <span class="companylink">Swiss Re</span> estimated in 2015 that if the 1985 earthquake in Mexico City occurred again, it would cost $15.6 billion in economic damages, of which $12.4 billion would be uninsured. At the time, the 1985 earthquake cost $4 billion in economic losses and about $500 million in insured losses in current dollars, says <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span>. "The Mexican insurance market is not as well penetrated as the US market and underwriters are well aware that the city sits on a seismic zone and that many buildings do not meet appropriate standards for insurance despite efforts to improve codes in the aftermath of the ‘85 quake," the bank says.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harvey Hit Geico Harder Than Irma, Buffett Says</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Car insurer Geico suffered greater losses from Hurricane Harvey than Hurricane Irma, says Warren Buffett, chairman of Geico's parent company <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway</span>. <span class="companylink">Geico</span> is the biggest car insurer in Florida, where Irma made landfall earlier this month, and the second-biggest in Texas, where Harvey struck in August. But Harvey caused massive flooding, which can be more damaging to cars than wind. Buffett said in August that he expected <span class="companylink">Geico</span> to report losses on about 50,000 cars following Harvey. "It's very hard to give numbers but... there were more total losses by quite a margin in Harvey than in Irma," Buffett says. (nicole.friedman@wsj.com; @NicoleFriedman)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. single-family housing starts continued to edge higher in August, in what could be the last snapshot of the market's health before the cleanup from major hurricanes begins to skew construction activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall housing starts, however, slipped 0.8% in August from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.18 million, driven by continued steep declines in multifamily building, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family starts rose 1.6% in August, while starts for buildings with two or more units and fell 6.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report offers a mixed picture of a market in which single-family construction is gradually improving while multifamily construction is declining significantly due to an oversupply of apartments in many urban markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts were up 2.7% in the first eight months of 2017 compared with the same period a year earlier. Permits rose 7.5% from the first eight months of 2016. The three-month moving average for single-family home starts was the highest since the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. median household income, adjusted for inflation, set a record in 2016, surpassing the previous peak in 1999, the Census Bureau reported last week, as Americans enjoy a period of sustained income growth and economic prosperity. Despite those gains, new construction remains weak due to a shortage of labor, lack of available land and other factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Almost every other item of investment, everything is up and recovered, but housing construction has not recovered," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly data on housing starts tend to be volatile and imprecise; August's 0.8% loss came with a margin of error of 9.6 percentage points. The 5.7% rise for permits had a 2-point margin of error.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential building permits, which provide a less volatile read on the market, rebounded in August. Permits, which typically lead starts by a month or two, rose 5.7% to a 1.3 million annual rate last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits fell 1.5% for single-family houses but jumped 19.6% last month for apartment buildings and other multifamily buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Limited supply and fast-rising prices have squeezed many would-be home buyers this year, despite mortgage rates that moved lower during the spring and summer. In July, purchases of previously owned homes and newly built single-family homes both fell from the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">August is likely to provide the last indication of the health of the housing market before storms in Florida and Texas weigh on the data. The Commerce Department on Tuesday said hurricane-affected counties in Florida and Texas accounted for about 13% of total U.S. building permits last year.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Connecticut's economy continues to trail its neighbors, the state's housing market is now falling behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contrast between Connecticut and Massachusetts is stark. Home construction permits in Connecticut fell 26% through July 2017 from the same period last year, according to federal data. Massachusetts permits rose 26% during that time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home sales prices in Connecticut edged up 1% through July 2017 from a year earlier, according to the Warren Group, a real-estate information firm. Massachusetts prices rose 6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The travails in Connecticut's housing market highlight the state's difficulty digging itself out of the losses from the recession. Connecticut has regained 78% of the 119,100 jobs it lost during the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every other New England state has recovered all positions it lost. Massachusetts has added more than three times the numbers of jobs it lost during the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connecticut's economy has been buffeted by a parade of corporate departures. <span class="companylink">General Electric Co</span>. left for Boston last year, and <span class="companylink">Aetna Inc</span>. said this year that it would move its headquarters to New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don Klepper-Smith, chief economist for consulting firm DataCore Partners LLC, said the differences between the housing markets in Connecticut and Massachusetts come down to jobs. "You can't have meaningful traction in the local housing market without traction in the labor market," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some single-family home builders are sitting on the sideline as a result. Kevin Santini, co-owner of Santini Homes, said his company owns land in the northeast section of the state and is waiting for demand to pick up before starting construction on more single-family homes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Granger MacDonald, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders, on Monday said builder confidence dimmed this month as "recent hurricanes have intensified our members' concerns about the availability of labor and the cost of building materials."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction has ground to a crawl in the weeks after the storm in affected areas of Texas and Florida, but should begin to pick back up as the rebuilding commences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Texas, repairing damaged homes is likely to strain an already tight labor market, dampening construction activity. But rebuilding new homes could eventually boost home starts. Houston builders were on track to build about 30,000 homes this year—about as many as were destroyed in the storm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a pause and a reset going on in Houston, but I think in a few months we'll see things return to normal," said Scott Norman, executive director of the Texas Association of Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic forecasters expect the storms will cause weaker growth in the short run, but activity should pick up in subsequent quarters as rebuilding efforts gain traction.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker signed a bill Monday that would give Taiwan's <span class="companylink">Foxconn Technology</span> Group $3 billion in economic incentives to open a mega-plant in the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The package garnered pushback from Democratic lawmakers, who said the deal was bad for taxpayers. But the Republican-controlled state legislature easily passed the bill[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/wisconsin-assembly-expected-to-approve-3-billion-tax-package-for-foxconn-1503002185], which was introduced in July in a White House ceremony[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/apple-supplier-foxconn-to-build-10-billion-factory-in-u-s-1501102903] by Mr. Walker and President Donald Trump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foxconn, formally known as <span class="companylink">Hon Hai Precision Industry Co</span>., plans to invest $10 billion to build a 20 million square-foot campus in southeastern Wisconsin that could employ up to 13,000 workers over a period of six years. The facility would build liquid-crystal display technology, or LCD screens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a truly transformational step for our state," Mr. Walker said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the jobs created directly from the plant, Mr. Walker had argued the deal[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/wisconsin-governor-defends-foxconn-deal-amid-growing-concerns-1502381401] would help turn the state into a technology hub that could attract young workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Democrats raised concerns about the price tag and whether the deal would actually bring the number of jobs promised to the state. A state fiscal analysis found that taxpayers wouldn't recoup their investment until the 2042-2043 fiscal year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senate Democratic Leader Jennifer Shilling said the governor and Republicans "are putting homegrown businesses at a competitive disadvantage while committing taxpayers to decades of economic costs and liabilities."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democrats also raised concerns over whether Foxconn would follow through on its promises. In 2014, the company explored opening a $40 million facility in Pennsylvania that never materialized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans praised the bill signing. "Today Wisconsin is officially saying yes to a $10 billion development project, 13,000 careers and new opportunities throughout Wisconsin," said State Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican from Rochester, in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal has also raised questions about the effectiveness of tax incentives in luring companies to invest in states. The total annual cost of tax incentives reached $45 billion by 2015, according to data from the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Joseph De Avila </div><div>567 words</div><div>18 September 2017</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A11A</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Connecticut's economy continues to trail its neighbors, the state's housing market is now falling behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contrast between Connecticut and Massachusetts is stark. Home construction permits in Connecticut fell 26% through July 2017 from the same period last year, according to federal data. Massachusetts permits rose 26% during that time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home sales prices in Connecticut edged up 1% through July 2017 from a year earlier, according to the Warren Group, a real-estate information firm. Massachusetts sales prices rose 6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The travails in Connecticut's housing market highlight the state's difficulty digging itself out of the losses from the recession. Connecticut has regained 78% of the 119,100 jobs it lost during the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every other New England state has recovered all positions it lost and then some. Massachusetts has added more than three times the numbers of jobs it lost during the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connecticut's economy has been buffeted by a parade of corporate departures. <span class="companylink">General Electric Co</span>. left for Boston last year, and <span class="companylink">Aetna Inc</span>. said this year that it would move its headquarters to New York. <span class="companylink">Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc</span>. said last week that it, too, would depart for Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don Klepper-Smith, chief economist for consulting firm DataCore Partners LLC, said the differences between the housing markets in Connecticut and Massachusetts come down to jobs. "You can't have meaningful traction in the local housing market without traction in the labor market," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some single-family home builders are sitting on the sideline as a result. Kevin Santini, co-owner of Santini Homes, said his company owns land in Ellington, Conn., in the northeast section of the state and is waiting for demand to pick up before starting construction on more single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've chosen not to break ground on it because we want to make sure the market is sound," Mr. Santini said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has built about 20 single-family homes during the past decade and instead has focused on the stronger rental market, he said. The company has built about 500 rental units over the past 10 years, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The departures of GE, <span class="companylink">Aetna</span> and now Alexion have hurt the state's reputation, Mr. Santini said. "I hate to say it, but we are a laughingstock," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some bright spots for Connecticut's housing market. More than 19,200 homes were sold through July, an 8% increase over the same time frame in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high-end market in Greenwich, Conn., also has bounced back from 2016. There have been 41 homes priced at $5 million or more that sold through Sept. 13, a 41% increase over the same time frame last year, according to David Haffenreffer, branch manager for Houlihan Lawrence's Greenwich office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median sales prices for the high-end market in Greenwich have reached $6.25 million, up 1% compared with last year, but still down about 20% from 2010, according to Mr. Haffenreffer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are about 600 homes on the market in Greenwich and that means buyers can take their time and be choosy on what they bid on, he said. "We are encouraging our sellers to strategically price their home right," he added.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jacky Wong </div><div>519 words</div><div>18 September 2017</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have been calling the Australian housing market a "bubble" for years, yet prices keep charting higher. The market, though, could finally be about to turn south. That won't be pretty for the country's banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property market has been skyrocketing Down Under -- prices in Sydney have gone up 80% since 2012, while in Melbourne they have gained 54%. In turn, houses have become unaffordable for many Australians as prices keep outpacing income growth. An average home in Sydney now costs more than 12 times the median income there, according to research firm Demographia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To keep houses within the reach of buyers, banks seem to have loosened their lending standards. Home lending is big business for Australian banks -- more than half of their loan books consist of residential mortgages, amounting to $1.2 trillion, a figure that has risen 47% in the past five years. Analysts say much of this new lending has been dubious: Around one-third of Australian mortgage applica-tions contain inaccurate information, resulting in around $400 billion of so-called liar loans, according to <span class="companylink">UBS</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many home buyers have also been taking out interest-only mortgage loans, meaning that borrowers don't need to repay the principal for a certain period, usually five years. Nearly 40% of outstanding home loans are interest-only. The risk is that borrowers will be unable to repay these loans once their interest-only period expires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is fine as long as the property market keeps going up, as homeowners can sell their houses to cover loan repayments. Once the market stops rising, though, it will become much harder for stretched households to avoid problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australian regulators are trying to cool the property market by reining in the use of interest-only loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they face another difficulty. Tightened capital controls in China have damped property demand in Australia, previously a popular venue for Chinese buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Direct overseas property investment from China plunged 82% in the first half globally, according to <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, with investors there finding it harder to get their money out of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little wonder, then, that Australian house prices are starting to slow -- they were flat month-on-month in major cities in August. That, in turn, could hurt banks' earnings as loan growth slows and provisions start to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australian banks, though, are still trading at a prem-ium to their peers in other countries: The four biggest Australian banks on average trade at 2.1 times tangible book value, much higher than, say, <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span>, which trades at 1.7 times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country's largest bank by market value, Common-wealth Bank of Australia, looks the most vulnerable. It is the most expensive of the big four, at 2.5 times tangible book. Aside from housing-market worries, it has recently been embroiled in a probe related to money laundering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shorting Australian banks has long been a "widow-maker." Now, though, it could finally be a winning trade.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central banks will be in the spotlight this week, with the Federal Reserve and <span class="companylink">Bank of Japan</span> releasing policy statements. The U.S. also will see existing-home sales data and jobless claims figures that could reflect hurricane damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WEDNESDAY: The National Association of Realtors releases August data on existing-home sales, after July sales of previously owned homes fell to their weakest level this year [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/home-sales-decline-in-july-to-slowest-pace-this-year-1503584169]. July's figures reflected a shortage of homes for sale weighing more heavily on the market, as sales declined 1.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.44 million. The August figures will provide the latest snapshot of a housing market characterized by tight inventory and solid demand.

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Rental Construction Drops Despite Demand; Housing starts edged 0.5% lower for single-family, but plummeted 17% for multi-family development in July</span>
</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>533 words</div><div>12 September 2017</div><div>08:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development of rental apartments is driving the latest construction boom, even in places like Dallas long associated with acres of subdivisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But construction of such multifamily units is poised to wind down despite rising demand, raising questions whether single-family home builders will step up to fill the void. Otherwise, construction, a crucial driver of the U.S. economy might simply lose steam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than half of U.S. metropolitan areas are projected to see more multifamily housing built in 2017 than the annual average from 1980 to 2016, according to an analysis by <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers in the Dallas area are building 84% more multifamily units this year than the historic average, but just 48% more single-family ones. Charleston, S.C. is seeing 216% more multifamily units being built than the historic average and 37% more single-family units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans' changing preference for renting over owning reflects a generational shift that is taking place in all regions, said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. "It's not just a few coastal metros that are built out and are only building up," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend reflects growing demand among millennials for apartment units in the heart of major cities. Young people are renting longer, both by choice and because they are struggling to save for a down payment and qualify for a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While demand among younger households is starting to shift back to homeownership, builders aren't ramping up single-family unit construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall U.S. housing starts declined for the fourth time in five months in July, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. Total housing starts decreased 4.8% from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.155 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While starts edged 0.5% lower for single-family construction, they plummeted 17.1% for construction on buildings with five or more units. Apartment construction is tapering off because of an oversupply of units, especially at the top end of the market that is causing rents to flatten in many major cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm optimistic that single-family will catch up," Mr. McLaughlin said. "It's not going to happen this year and it's probably not going to happen next year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are immediate consequences to a pullback in multifamily buildings if single-family doesn't immediately catch up. It could exacerbate a shortage of homes. While there is a surplus of luxury apartments in most major metropolitan areas, housing overall remains scarce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction employment—a major economic driver—could pull back, although that is somewhat balanced by the fact that single-family building employs three times as many workers per unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty-seven metropolitan areas are seeing more multifamily construction than normal but less single-family development, while just nine places are seeing less multifamily and more single-family activity than usual, according to <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metro areas that are seeing an apartment boom and a single-family slump include some surprises, such as Detroit, Kansas City and Madison, Wis.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Mistakes to Avoid When Filling Out the CSS Profile for College Financial Aid; Some schools use the CSS Profile to determine aid. Getting it wrong can cost a lot of money.</span>
</div><div class="author">By Veronica Dagher </div><div>1275 words</div><div>10 September 2017</div><div>22:14</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">College financial-aid application season is coming soon. That means lots of angst, lots of questions—and lots of forms to fill out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a minimum, most families should fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or Fafsa. The Fafsa must be completed if the student wants to apply for Federal grants and loans. But some families will also need to complete the College Board's CSS/Financial Aid Profile, which certain schools—most of them private—use to determine how to award their own aid. (Check the school's financial-aid-office website to see if it's required.) Each form becomes available Oct. 1 to apply for the 2018-19 academic year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CSS Profile requires much more detailed financial information about the family, which can be helpful for families who want to better explain the nuances of their financial circumstances. The extensive data allows financial-aid officers to see deeper into the family's application, and may help identify a need, says Susan McCrackin, senior director for financial-aid services at the College Board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, filing out the CSS Profile provides more opportunities for families to make mistakes, which can end up costing them both time and money. Here's a look at some mistakes to avoid:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conflicting Information. Colleges that require the CSS Profile also require a Fafsa, and all of the financial data requested on the Fafsa is also requested on the CSS Profile, says Deborah Fox, founder of Fox College Funding LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there are discrepancies between the two, it will confuse financial-aid officers and delay the awarding of any aid offer. This could happen if, for example, a parent reports the value of the student's 529 account on the Fafsa, but reports the value of both the student's and his or her sibling's 529 accounts on the CSS Profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having conflicting information also raises the chances of being chosen for "verification," a process that requires the family to submit documentation, such as account statements, to verify their numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Double-checking your numbers is very important, Ms. Fox says, especially when parents are working on the applications independently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CSS Profile breaks down the sources of income and assets in more detail than the Fafsa so make sure the sum of individual entries is the same on the CSS Profile as on the Fafsa, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overestimating Income. While all questions about income on the 2018-2019 Fafsa refer to the 2016 calendar year, the 2018-2019 CSS Profile will ask detailed questions about the parents' 2016 income as well as less-detailed questions about 2017 and 2018 income. Parents will need to project their 2017 and 2018 income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's good to be conservative with your projections, and it's OK if the figures are slightly off, says Kalman Chany, author of "Paying for College Without Going Broke." There's no need to mention a potential raise or bonus unless you're certain it's going to happen. Self-employed individuals should estimate their projected net income after business expenses are deducted, Mr. Chany says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you've lost your job or received notice that you will be laid off and your income in 2017 and/or 2018 may be much less than in 2016, mention that in the "Explanations/Special Circumstances" section of the CSS Profile, he says. All the schools that receive your CSS Profile will see the information you write in that section.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be sure to contact the aid office of all schools directly—even those that don't require the CSS Profile—about this reduction of income. It may land the student far more financial aid than if the parent stayed silent, Mr. Chany says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oversharing Information. On the CSS Profile, some colleges will ask "Supplemental Questions" chosen by that school. For example, a school may ask what cars the family owns. This information is used to help that school put the rest of the application in context, says Ms. Fox.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, answer these extra questions only in the "Supplemental Questions" section, not in the "Explanations/Special Circumstances" section, she says. That way, only the college that asked that question will get the answer. If your explanation exceeds the available space, send that school a letter. If a family discloses that it owns a newer luxury car in the "Explanations/Special Circumstances" section, which all of the schools see, and indicates in the standard questions that they have modest means or are experiencing financial hardship, it will likely raise a red flag at the financial-aid offices of all the schools the student is applying to, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This new information may cause all the schools to require additional documentation or may be taken out of context and reduce the family's financial-aid award, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Double-Counting Investments. If a student's parents are divorced, it can cause confusion during the financial-aid process. College Board is updating the CSS Profile to make it clearer, Ms. McCrackin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the parent whom the student lives with most who should report their income on the CSS Profile application shared with the student, says Ms. McCrackin. If the student lives with both parents equally, the parent who provides the most support should enter their income, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schools that use the CSS Profile determine whose financial circumstances they will evaluate, she says. Some schools will only gather information about the custodial household (parent and their new spouse if remarried), other schools will ask for information pertaining to the noncustodial household (parent and their new spouse if remarried), Ms. McCrackin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another consideration is how recently the divorce occurred and whether the parents filed joint returns while married. The CSS Profile requires parents to report their income for the two years before the academic year for which they're applying for aid. If the parents are now divorced but were married during either of those years and filed or will file jointly, the parent who is completing the CSS Profile should separate his or her income from the total declared in those years. The parent should use his or her W-2 to report their income alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest or dividends earned jointly in those years should be reported at 50% on the CSS Profile. For example, if a joint return shows $300 in interest income, the reporting parent should report $150 in interest income on the CSS Profile, Ms. McCrackin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This will make sure that the interest isn't double-counted.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Katherine Clarke </div><div>419 words</div><div>6 September 2017</div><div>14:57</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A heavily renovated Tudor-style home in Greenwich, Conn.[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/a-greenwich-mansion-for-family-and-art-1489503514] has sold for $22 million, defying a prolonged pricing slump [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/greenwichs-luxury-housing-market-is-fraying-1496223004]in what's traditionally been one of the most expensive markets in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property, known as North Court, sold for $2 million above its asking price, said Helene Barre of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, who represented the sellers. The property went on the market for $20 million last fall, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transaction appears to be the priciest in Greenwich so far in 2017, according to appraiser Jonathan Miller. The Greenwich market has been struggling in recent years due to the rising state income tax burden on the wealthy and a growing preference among buyers for apartments in Manhattan's trophy towers. However, Ms. Barre said she saw an uptick in interest in high-end properties this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sellers are Drew Aaron and Hana Soukupová. Mr. Aaron, 40, is the CEO of the Aaron Group, a global distributor of paper and packaging, and the CEO of Lionsgate Capital, a mortgage and insurance advisory firm in Mallorca and Ibiza. Ms. Soukupová, 31, is a model who has posed for Victoria's Secret, Gucci and Versace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple paid $8 million for the 3.75-acre property in 2012 and spent an additional $7.5 million on restoring and renovating the seven-bedroom main home, Mr. Aaron said. In addition to the home there is also a pool and a tennis court, a boxwood garden and a guesthouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple originally intended to spend the rest of their lives there, but eventually grew tired with the "rat-race" and decided to move their family—they have two young children—to Mallorca last year, Mr. Aaron said. "Now, at our house in Mallorca, my wife grows 75 different fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices," he said. "We've rescued two donkeys, four sheep and a pony."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Aaron isn't entirely done with Connecticut: Earlier this month he bought the 13-acre Westport estate[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/connecticut-country-home-of-edgar-bronfman-sr-seeks-7-995-million-1462285532] formerly owned by late Seagram billionaire Edgar M. Bronfman Sr., for $7 million, he said. Mr. Aaron said he plans to use the same team of vendors who worked on North Court to rehabilitate it and then resell it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer of the Greenwich property was represented by Fran Ehrlich of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Milwaukee Sheriff</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke, a longtime supporter of President Donald Trump and a prominent face in conservative media, resigned from his post Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He submitted his resignation to the clerk of Milwaukee County, said Craig Peterson, a spokesman for the sheriff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The letter didn't state any reason for his resignation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Peterson said Mr. Clarke won't be making a statement on the reason for his resignation until next week, but his exit was "unrelated" to any issues at Milwaukee county jail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Clarke is the subject of multiple lawsuits over his role in overseeing the jail, including a civil-rights suit in the death of Terrill J. Thomas. Mr. Thomas, 38 years old, died of dehydration while in the jail's custody in April 2016 after his water supply was cut off for seven days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Peterson had previously said the "folks who passed away were terribly ill people."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Peterson said Mr. Clarke isn't expected to take up a role in the Trump administration but declined to comment further on his plans.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of existing homes going under contract fell in July, the fourth decline in the past five months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said its pending-home-sales index declined 0.8% from the prior month to 109.1 in July.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sharon Nunn, Chris Kirkham and Sarah Chaney </div><div>866 words</div><div>31 August 2017</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hotel developers are slowing down new U.S. construction projects after years of rapid growth, a result of tighter lending conditions and a ballooning supply of rooms in large markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though consumer demand remains healthy, hotel construction spending was down 2% to $27.5 billion in June at a seasonally adjusted annual rate from December, according to Census Bureau data, after more than tripling since bottoming in 2011. A combination of increased travel spending, growing consumer confidence and cheap credit prompted developers to pour money into construction projects in the aftermath of the 2007-09 recession. Now, growth in new hotel rooms is outpacing the number of consumers able to stay in them in cities like New York, Houston and Miami, prompting banks and developers to take a breather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As soon as they started seeing a lot of cranes in the air, people started getting cautious again," said Inigo Ardid, co-president of <span class="companylink">Key International</span>, a Miami real-estate investment and development company for hotels throughout Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall growth in the supply of U.S. hotel rooms has been slower in recent years than it was going into the last downturn, but there has been rapid growth in the nation's largest markets, leading to pockets of oversupply. Hotel-room supply has grown 2.5% in the nation's top 25 markets so far this year, according to <span class="companylink">STR Inc</span>., a data company that tracks the hotel industry, compared with 1.5% in all other markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the challenge: Construction labor shortages have pushed up the cost of building hotels at a time when revenue growth for hotel rooms across the U.S. is beginning to slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That kind of one-two punch doesn't make it exciting to build another hotel," said Mark Laport, president and chief executive of Concord Hospitality Enterprises Co., which develops, owns and manages properties across the U.S. for most major chains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks tightened commercial real-estate lending standards in the second quarter across categories including construction, nonresidential and multifamily development, according to a July survey of 76 U.S. banks and 22 U.S. branches of foreign banks conducted by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
David Kong, president and CEO of Best Western Hotels &amp; Resorts, said his company created a team last year to work with owners and developers who were having difficulty getting construction financing. He said the company has been more focused on acquiring existing hotels under its brands because "we recognize there are going to be less and less new construction projects."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some large cities that bounced back early in the economic recovery have seen huge growth in the number of new rooms, dragging down revenue from each available room. New York, Miami, Austin and Dallas all saw declines in revenue per available room for the first seven months of this year compared with a year earlier. Given the pipeline of projects, growth in new hotel rooms is projected to accelerate over the next two years in these four major markets, according to a forecast from CBRE Hotels Americas Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers said the construction-lending environment has tightened as the cycle has gotten longer, with wounds from the financial crisis and recession weighing on investors' minds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we were going to market with a new project three years ago, we would maybe have had 10 lenders that were interested in the project," said Amit Patel, president of Winwood Hospitality Group, which owns and develops hotels in North Carolina and has an existing hotel investment in Nashville. "That number today is probably closer to three."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami's growing supply and recently declining lodging market is a microcosm of the trend and a warning; almost 3,500 rooms were under construction in the city as of March, which is 6% of Miami's existing supply, and the city's occupancy rates and revenue per room have ticked down by almost 7% since 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houston was experiencing similar perils before flooding hit the city this week. The oil-rich city had almost 5,000 rooms under construction as of March, which is 6% of Houston's existing supply. Almost half of Houston-area hotel loans are distressed because of declines in hotel-room occupancy and dwindling income to pay back mortgages, according to <span class="companylink">Kroll Bond Rating Agency</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some fundamentals point in the sector's favor. The average annual U.S. occupancy rate at the peak of hotel construction last cycle was 62.8%, and was rapidly declining. By comparison, occupancy was at 65.5% over the last year, which is a slight uptick from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike in past cycles, when developers overbuilt across the board, this last growth period has been much more moderate. Average room-supply growth was less than 2% across the U.S. in June, according to STR. That is in line with long-term averages and lower than supply growth of about 3% going into the 2007-09 recession and 4% growth before the 2001 recession.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building-products supplier <span class="companylink">Boral Ltd</span>. forecast continued growth across its businesses over the coming financial year as the construction of roads and other infrastructure in Australia rolls on and further improvements are expected in U.S. housing markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Riding on a 16% increase in net profit for its fiscal year ended June 30, <span class="companylink">Boral</span> said it expected a significant lift in underlying earnings from its North American division in particular, aided by a recent acquisition, and expected market growth as housing starts look set to increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said it was monitoring flooding in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, which could have an impact on its operations in and around Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Boral</span>'s Australian arm is expected to deliver higher earnings, underpinned by infrastructure volume growth, led by a need for asphalt and continued demand for concrete and cement, the company said on Wednesday. Still, the company said that is expected to be offset by property results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For its latest fiscal year, <span class="companylink">Boral</span> reported a net profit of 297 million Australian dollars (US$214.6 million), compared with net profit of A$256 million a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue for the fiscal year rose 2% to A$4.39 billion from A$4.31 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said it plans to pay a final dividend of 12 Australian cents a share, bringing the full-year payout to 24 Australian cents, up 7% on last year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brought by Palin</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A federal court on Tuesday dismissed a defamation lawsuit brought by Sarah Palin against <span class="companylink">New York Times Co</span>., saying the former Alaska governor failed to show that the newspaper acted maliciously when it made an error in an editorial about gun violence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee filed the suit after the Times ran an editorial in June that suggested her political-action committee helped incite the 2011 assassination attempt against former Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. After publication, the Times corrected the article, noting that there was no evidence of a link between Ms. Palin's activities and the shooting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representatives for Ms. Palin didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> editorial was published hours after an anti-Republican gunman seriously wounded House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and injured three others at a congressional baseball practice outside Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The piece explored the issue of political rhetoric and gun violence and made a connection to the 2011 shooting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The paper posted its correction the day after the editorial ran. Ms. Palin's suit said the correction and apology the editorial board tweeted were "woefully insufficient."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for the New York Times said that the error was an "honest mistake" and that the paper was delighted by the court's decision.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>498 words</div><div>29 August 2017</div><div>09:01</div><div>WSJ Pro Central Banking</div><div>RSTPROCB</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2017, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home price growth accelerated slightly in June due to upward pressure from limited inventory and strong buyer demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;PCoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices, which cover the entire nation, rose 5.8% in the 12 months ended in June, up slightly from a 5.7% year-over-year increase reported in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices hit a record in September and the pace of growth has largely accelerated since then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-city index gained 4.9% over the year, down from 5% in May. The 20-city index gained 5.7%, identical to the previous month. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected the 20-city index to rise 5.7% in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price gains have been driven by growing demand thanks to rising wages and a large demographic of people entering their 30s and looking to buy homes, as well as limited supply. Economists have said they are concerned that price growth that continues to outpace income growth won't be sustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given current economic conditions and the tight housing market, an immediate reversal in home price trends appears unlikely," said David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. Mr. Blitzer noted that while rising prices are driving down the affordability of homes, job and wage growth and low mortgage rates are helping to make homes more affordable for some.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are growing quickly and much faster than incomes giving some economists pause. But home-price growth remains less than half of what it was during the housing bubble in the mid-2000s. Then prices grew by more than 14% for much of 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some markets are seeing remarkably rapid gains driven primarily by strong economic growth. Seattle led the way in June with a 13.4% home-price increase, Portland reported a 8.2% year-over-year gain and Dallas reported a 7.7% annual increase in home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-over-month, the U.S. Index rose 0.9% in June before seasonal adjustment, while the 10-city and the 20-city index both rose 0.7% from May to June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After seasonal adjustment, the national index rose 0.4 % month-over-month, the 10-city index remained flat and the 20-city index rose 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After seasonal adjustment, 14 out of 20 cities saw prices rise in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices are helping to depress sales activity by making homes less affordable. Sales of previously owned homes fell 1.3% in July to their weakest level of the year, the National Association of Realtors said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you look at the inventory decline and how fast prices have risen, there's just not enough homes for sale and prices are too high for a lot of buyers," said Nela Richardson, chief economist at Redfin.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell in July to their weakest level of the year as a shortage of homes for sale weighed on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales fell 1.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.44 million, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. The sales pace is up 2.1% from July of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nearly all Realtors across the country are reporting that the inventory shortage is limiting sales potential," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales pace there was a 4.2 month supply of homes on the market, down from 4.8 months a year ago. There were 9% fewer homes on the market in July than there were a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One year ago, I thought it was a very tight condition, but the housing shortage has intensified," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory has been declining for most of the last three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The peak selling season, which spans the warm months before the start of the school year, was the most competitive in memory. Realtors reported a surge in demand as the economy continued to strengthen and millennials showed interest in buying homes. Properties have been spending on average 30 days on the market, down from 36 days a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike McCann, a Realtor in Philadelphia, typically a fairly sleepy real-estate market, said buyers might make three or four offers and still keep losing out in bidding wars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McCann said people are choosing to stay in their homes longer, so he tries to entice them to put their homes on the market through flyers and social media, even reaching out to owners and telling them he has a specific buyer interested in their home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The inventory is very, very, very low. It's crazy. We're all trying to find ways to get more property," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite strong demand, home sales have essentially been flat throughout the critical spring and early summer period, which economists said is reason for caution. Home sales are a critical indicator of consumer confidence in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This slide isn't enough to make us question the broader economic outlook. Not yet. But if you're the worrying type it's headed the wrong way certainly," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dearth of inventory pinches the market both because buyers get frustrated and give up if they can't find a home they like and because it pushes up prices beyond what many families can afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price in July hit $258,300 up 6.2% from a year earlier, NAR said. Wages during the same period increased by about 2%, helping to push purchasing a first home out of reach for more households.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said that while most of the reason the market is performing poorly appears to be a lack of inventory, there also are signs consumers are pulling back because they are concerned about a price bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is this sense that prices cannot get higher," said Nela Richardson, chief economist at Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zachary Sensenbach, an agent with Redfin, said he can often show buyers all the properties that fit their criteria in just a weekend. Many are simply giving up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They'll write these offers and then once they realize what it takes to win on something they pump the brakes a little bit," he said. "They just get tired of losing."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing has shown weakness across all segments of the market in recent months. Purchases of newly built single-family homes, which represent a tiny slice of all U.S. home sales, decreased 9.4% [https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf] to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 571,000 in July, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts declined for the fourth time in five months in July, the Commerce Department reported last week.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's no doubt the tight inventory situation is weighing on things," said Aaron Terrazas, a senior economist at Zillow.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Quantum Energy Partners</span> committed $450 million in equity to form a new oil-and-gas company focused on the Eagle Ford shale, the latest of a series of investments the energy private-equity firm made outside the more crowded Permian Basin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, Vitruvian Exploration IV LLC, will begin to operate in the Eagle Ford shale of South Texas during the fourth quarter of 2017, according to a press release. Vitruvian IV acquired or agreed to acquire around 120,000 net acres of undeveloped leasehold in the area, including nearly 70,000 in the Javelina field from publicly traded producer Sanchez Energy Corp., the release said. A press release Sanchez issued early this month said it sold the Javelina assets for around $105 million in cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Vitruvian IV deal marked the third time Quantum backed the company's management team, which is led by Richard Lane as executive chairman, John Thaeler as chief executive and Brian Rickmers as chief financial officer, according to the release. The three energy-industry veterans previously founded Quantum-backed <span class="companylink">Vitruvian Exploration</span> II and <span class="companylink">Vitruvian Exploration</span> III, the release said. It added that the two companies operated in the Oklahoma's SCOOP and STACK plays, respectively, and recently sold their assets to other producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houston-based Quantum, which is targeting [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/defying-oil-jitters-quantum-holds-2-6-billion-first-closing-for-energy-fund-1496147448] up to $5.25 billion for a new fund, concentrates on the upstream, midstream, oil-field services and power sectors. Its portfolio companies span different oil-and-gas exploration regions in the U.S., including California, the Rocky Mountains, the Permian Basin of West Texas and Southern New Mexico, as well as the Northeast's Appalachian Basin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm has been investing actively this year, particularly in areas outside the Permian Basin, where intense drilling and higher asset valuations are making more difficult to find deals at attractive prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Quantum in late July led a more than [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/quantum-energy-partners-leads-300-million-investment-to-form-new-oil-company-1500984824] $300 million investment to form Impact Exploration and Production Partners LLC, an oil-and-gas company focused on the Rocky Mountain region. A week later, the firm announced that Rockcliff Energy II LLC, one of its portfolio companies, bought $525 million [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/quantum-backed-company-buys-525-million-in-assets-from-samson-resources-1501627888] in assets in East Texas and North Louisiana from Samson Resources II LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's harder to put money to work intelligently today in the Permian than it was a couple of years ago, so we're being more selective" there, Wil VanLoh, Quantum's founder and chief executive, said in late July.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. new-home sales fell sharply in July, providing fresh evidence that a shortage of housing inventory is depleting activity across the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes, a narrow slice of all home sales, decreased 9.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 571,000 in July, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It has been surprising the extent to which new-home sales have not picked up more," said Aaron Terrazas, a senior economist at Zillow. "It does seem to reflect a bit of a market breakdown."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the problem, Mr. Terrazas said, is that high land and construction costs are making it difficult to build less-expensive homes, limiting the pool of buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the housing market has settled into a pattern of rising prices and flattening sales throughout much of the peak home-buying season. A lack of new-home construction is damping new and existing-home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A typical new home spent 2.9 months on the market in July, down from 3.6 months a year ago, suggesting demand remains strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly new-home-sales figures tend to be tumultuous, and so far this year the market for new homes has been gradually trending upward. Sales have risen 9.2% so far this year compared with the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're still on track for a pretty healthy increase in new-home sales this year," said Lee Stafford, managing director of economics and research at <span class="companylink">Ally Financial Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction has been dropping, with a significant slowdown in apartment building and gradual growth in new single-family home construction. U.S. housing starts declined for the fourth time in five months in July, the Commerce Department reported last week. Total housing starts decreased 4.8% from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.155 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But low inventory doesn't appear to be the only reason sales were weak last month. At the current sales pace, there was a 5.8-month supply of new homes on the market at the end of July, the highest level since 2015, although still below-normal levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent surveys of consumer sentiment indicate that buyers also perceive the market as frothy. Home prices have risen sharply over the last couple of years, including in the new-home segment. The median sale price for a new home sold in July was $313,700, up 6.3% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders remain largely optimistic about the market, saying they still see significant pent-up demand. Traffic from buyers visiting new-home communities remains strong, which suggests sales are poised to pick up in the months ahead.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a hotly anticipated memoir, Hillary Clinton writes that her upset loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential race will haunt her for the rest of her life, according to excerpts of the audio version that aired Wednesday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market continues to improve, extending gains that began not long after the economy bottomed out in the wake of the financial crisis. But the pace of improvement is slowing and cracks are starting to appear, raising questions about what the end of 2017 may bring.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rental costs as a share of income rose to a record high last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But renters have started to push back against rising costs. The rental-vacancy rate has reversed course.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WEDNESDAY: The eurozone economy had a surprisingly strong first half of the year, and economists expect to see indications this week that growth is continuing at only a slightly slower pace during the third quarter. <span class="companylink">IHS Markit</span>'s composite purchasing managers index for the currency area -- a measure of activity in manufacturing and services -- is forecast to fall a little in August, but remain close to the levels recorded in July.</p>

In June, sales of previously owned homes fell 1.8% to an annual rate of 5.52 million. Prices jumped as strong demand overwhelmed a pinched supply.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment-construction boom is coming to an end, and builders aren't ramping up single-family construction quickly enough to fill the void.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers for the past several months have slowed down on new apartment projects, reversing a five-year trend in which rental construction boomed while for-sale home construction has lagged behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For apartment dwellers and landlords, that suggests a recent slowdown in rent growth might be short-lived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For landlords it means there won't be as much of this fear of overbuilding, but unfortunately for renters . . . it just shows that the market is going to remain tight," said Jay Lybik, vice president of research services at Marcus &amp; Millichap, a commercial real-estate firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall U.S. housing starts declined for the fourth time in five months in July, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. Total housing starts decreased 4.8% from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.155 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While starts edged 0.5% lower for single-family construction, they plummeted 17.1% for construction on buildings with five or more units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts data are volatile and often are subject to large revisions, but a clear pattern has emerged over the past few months of slowing activity driven by a drop in apartment construction and only gradual improvement in single-family building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking into account population growth, single-family housing starts are 17% below the 50-year average, according to Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at housing search website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said single-family starts are being constrained by a lack of construction workers and land. That is likely to mean continued gradual recovery in the sector rather than a turbocharged expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we could overcome those hurdles, the demand is there," said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts reached a postrecession peak in October 2016. Since then the pace of building has slowed despite growing confidence among builders and consumers, a rising stock market and low unemployment -- all factors that should support construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks have been pulling back on apartment lending, which is weighing on construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts in the first seven months of the year were up 2.4% from the period in 2016, including an 8.6% jump in single-family construction. Apartment and condominium starts for buildings with five or more units are down 10.4% so far this year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a strong economy and increasing household formation, any decline in construction activity is likely to lead to more competition.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former Secretary of State John Kerry made national headlines earlier this year when, after spending decades summering on the Massachusetts island of Nantucket, he bought a home on nearby Martha's Vineyard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the face of it, the move doesn't seem surprising -- the two islands off Cape Cod are less than 20 miles apart, as the crow flies, and both are famed for their sweeping sandy beaches, historic New England charm and affluent summer residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But despite these similarities, denizens of the two preppy enclaves are fiercely loyal to their chosen island. Many Martha's Vineyard loyalists say they've never been to Nantucket, and vice versa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've never, ever visited Nantucket," said Daniel Phelan, 41, a Martha's Vineyard resident whose family has owned property on the Vineyard for generations. "I couldn't tell you anything about it except it's a longer boat ride" from the mainland, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents can rattle off a long list of perceived differences between the two islands, both of which can only be accessed by boat or plane. The larger, more heavily wooded Martha's Vineyard is closer to the mainland and more accessible. It also has a reputation for being more ethnically and racially diverse, relaxed and artsy, whereas Nantucket is seen as more buttoned-up, with a high-octane social scene that lures jet-setting CEO types.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In reality, said Martha's Vineyard real-estate agent Tom Wallace, buyers' loyalties to one island or the other are usually created not by intrinsic differences between the two places, but by ties to friends and family and happy memories of vacations past. He noted that even within Martha's Vineyard, many buyers and renters often only want to be on one particular part of the island where they've gone in the past, which for them is "their own center of the universe."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, he said, the real-estate markets on Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard largely "don't compete with each other, because they each have their own following."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate doesn't come cheap on either island, but prices are higher on Nantucket, where a diminishing supply of buildable land has attracted the attention of investors. Property markets on both islands are gradually regaining their footing after a slowdown in the years after the global financial downturn. On Nantucket, the median sales price for the first five months of this year was $1.235 million. That's up significantly from $830,000 for the same period in 2013, but still down from $1.634 million for the first five months of 2007, according to data from the Warren Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the upscale Martha's Vineyard town of Chilmark, the median price was $1.188 million -- up from $777,500 in 2012 but still well below a peak of $3.065 million for the first five months of 2007. As the market recovers, both islands are seeing a resurgence in spec development despite stiff building restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Phelan and his wife, Lisa, recently decided to permanently relocate to Martha's Vineyard from the San Francisco Bay Area after years of summer visits. Mr. Phelan, who worked in manufacturing in the Bay Area, said his family history on the Vineyard stretches back to his great-grandfather, who owned property on the island. His mother grew up spending summer vacations on the Vineyard, as did he. He and his wife decided to move to the island to be closer to his mother and other family members. His wife's employer, a pharmaceutical company, allows her to work remotely from the Vineyard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple originally planned to buy land and build a house, but quickly abandoned that idea -- construction on an island roughly 7 miles from the mainland is a long and costly process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, they bought a newly built spec home in Vineyard Haven in May for $748,900. The three-bedroom house, which had been listed with Ocean Park Realty, has a screened-in porch and an outdoor shower -- a sought-after feature in Vineyard homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nantucket homeowner Jim Houlihan said both islands are "beautiful," but agreed with other residents that people tend to develop a strong allegiance to one or the other: "Once you get bitten by the bug, that's your place."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Houlihan, who lives in New York's Westchester County, had vacationed in the Hamptons for years, but after visiting friends in Nantucket he and his wife, Pat, decided to try New England. After renting on Nantucket for a few summers, they decided to buy a home there. "We fell in love with it," he said, citing the fact that the island is far less developed than the Hamptons. Around 2012 they bought a house in Madaket, on the western end of the island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last fall, they upgraded to a larger house on 5 acres in Dionis, on the north shore of the island, for $4.1 million, according to public records. In classic Nantucket style, the five-bedroom house is shingled with white wooden trim, and has multiple decks and porches with views of Nantucket Sound. They plan to put in a pool and build a second home on the property for visiting family members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Houlihan, who owns <span class="companylink">Houlihan-Parnes Realtors</span> in Westchester, also sees Nantucket as a smart real-estate investment. Roughly half the island -- which measures about 48 square miles to Martha's Vineyard's 100 -- is conservation land. A 2% real-estate transfer fee on most property sales allows the island to conserve more land each year. (Martha's Vineyard has a similar fee on most real-estate sales, paid to the Martha's Vineyard Land Bank Commission.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Houlihan started investing in spec homes on the island about five years ago. His first two projects both sold in under 30 days, one for $3.8 million and another for $4.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spec building on Nantucket -- like all home-building and renovations -- is challenging because the entire island is strictly regulated by the Nantucket Historic District Commission. The commission works to maintain the island's historic architecture, requiring that all houses be shingled and even limiting the paint colors homeowners can choose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martha's Vineyard also has strict building codes, especially in its historic districts, but its architecture is more varied, ranging from the occasional contemporary home to the Gingerbread Cottages in Oak Bluffs, said Meg Bodnar of <span class="companylink">Tea Lane Associates</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consistency of Nantucket's architecture is part of its charm, said Lisa Larson, a real-estate agent who lives primarily in Manhattan but has summered on Nantucket for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the difficulty of the building process on Nantucket, a number of spec homes priced from $3 million to $7 million have come to market in the past few years, many of them fully furnished. The homes are eagerly snapped up by buyers who don't want to deal with the hassle and slow pace of navigating the building process on their own, said real-estate agent Steve DiFrancesco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Dennis and Tricia Brown, who bought a three-bedroom house on Nantucket in March for $1.725 million, the fact that the home was newly renovated was an important factor in their decision to buy it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's expensive to do renovations on Nantucket," said Mr. Brown, Group Operating Officer of the <span class="companylink">NPD Group</span>, a market-research company. "Having a house that was in move-in condition was important to us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple, who live on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, go to Nantucket almost every weekend in the summer and about once a month the rest of the year. They said they love Nantucket's small size, and lack of Hamptons-eque traffic (the island has no traffic lights).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brown bought his first home on Nantucket in 1992. Ms. Brown, a food broker, said when the couple met 10 years ago he refused to introduce her to any family members until she'd been to the island. "He said, 'you better meet Nantucket first -- Nantucket is part of my life,'" she recalled.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.), who was shot at a congressional baseball practice last month, has been discharged from a Washington hospital and will now undergo inpatient rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement Wednesday, MedStar Washington Hospital Center said Mr. Scalise "has made excellent progress in his recovery from a life-threatening gunshot wound six weeks ago." The hospital said the congressman was discharged on Tuesday and is "now beginning a period of intensive inpatient rehabilitation." The hospital said the third-ranking Republican is "in good spirits and is looking forward to his return to work once he completes rehabilitation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The statement didn't say where Mr. Scalise's inpatient rehabilitation will take place. Mr. Scalise's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Scalise was shot at a baseball field in Alexandria, Va., on June 14. The gunman, James T. Hodgkinson, was killed by police.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edged Higher in June</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. new-home sales rose slightly in June, a signal of gradual recovery in a segment of the market that continues to suffer from severe supply constraints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes -- a narrow slice of all U.S. home sales -- increased 0.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 610,000 in June, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. The gain was more modest than the 1.5% growth economists had predicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Combined with a 1.8% slide in existing-home sales that the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported earlier this week, the latest data suggest the lack of supply kept a lid on activity in the crucial spring selling season despite strong housing demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales are volatile and subject to large revisions. The month's slight gain fell well within the 12.1-percentage-point margin of error.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—U.S. new-home sales rose slightly in June, a signal of gradual recovery in a segment of the market that continues to suffer from severe supply constraints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes—a narrow slice of all U.S. home sales—increased 0.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 610,000 in June [http://www.census.gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrs], the Commerce Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gain was more modest than the 1.5% growth economists had predicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Combined with a 1.8% slide in existing-home sales that the National Association of Realtors reported earlier this week, the latest data suggest the lack of supply kept a lid on activity in the crucial spring selling season despite strong housing demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Frankly, it's not impressive," said Tian Liu, chief economist at Genworth Mortgage Insurance, of the June new-home-sales report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales are volatile and subject to large revisions. The month's slight gain fell well within the 12.1-percentage-point margin of error.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Longer-term trends indicate the market is continuing to recover, albeit more slowly that many economists say is needed, due to a shortage of new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 12-month rolling total of new-home sales was up 14.1% year-over-year and represented the most since June 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjusted for population growth, however, new-home sales were about 30% below the 50-year average in June, according to Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Liu said one critical reason why new-home sales aren't rebounding more quickly is that builders are focusing on higher-end construction. The median sale price for a new home sold in June was $310,800.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction has continued to lag behind the broader recovery, primarily due to labor shortages and a lack of desirable building lots. The size of the construction workforce in the U.S. declined to 10.4 million in 2015 from 10.6 million near the bottom of the market in 2010, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/labor-shortage-squeezes-home-builders-1501010255] by Issi Romem, chief economist at BuildZoom, a website for contractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is driving a boom in home-renovation activity, which is expected to hit a record level of $316 billion this year, but may be hurting demand for new homes as buyers elect to stay put [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/americans-pour-record-sums-into-home-improvements-1500975001] rather than pay a steep premium for a brand-new home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales pace, there was a 5.4-month supply of new homes on the market at the end of June. There were 272,000 new homes available for sale, the highest level in eight years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"New home building and new homes are increasingly looking like the key to breaking inventory gridlock," Mr. McLaughlin said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Candace Taylor </div><div>420 words</div><div>26 July 2017</div><div>10:15</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Academy Award-winning film producer Harvey Weinstein is reducing the price of his Hamptons home—which comes with an elaborate home theater—to $12.4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weinstein and his wife, Georgina Chapman, co-founder of the fashion label Marchesa, bought the Amagansett, N.Y., house in 2014 for $11.65 million, according to public records. They have been trying to sell it for the past few years, first putting it on the market for $13.5 million in 2016 then reducing the price to $12.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Unfortunately with our busy schedules we just don't have time to go to Amagansett as much as we'd like," Mr. Weinstein and Ms. Chapman said in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Newbold and Beate V. Moore of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, who have taken over the listing from <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, said the couple also has homes in New York City and Connecticut and will look for a home closer to the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gated Amagansett estate sits on roughly 2 acres with frontage on Gardiners Bay. Built around 1995 by filmmaker Barry Sonnenfeld, the house measures about 9,000 square feet, with five bedrooms plus an attached two-bedroom guest wing with a separate entrance. The home's terraces, outdoor heated pool and roof deck are positioned to take advantage of the bay views, the agents said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home has a finished lower level with a gym, children's playroom and the home theater, which fits about 50 people. The space has a separate projection room and a roughly 20-foot-wide screen set up for viewing 3-D films. The screening room contains one of the home's five wood burning fireplaces, so "when you're watching "Doctor Zhivago" you can light a fire," Mr. Newbold said. A lobby area adjacent to the theater has a wet bar, a popcorn machine and several tables for dining or cocktails. "We've loved hosting screenings there on the weekends for friends and family," Mr. Weinstein and Ms. Chapman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weinstein and his brother Bob co-founded <span class="companylink">Miramax Films</span> in 1979, producing hits like "Pulp Fiction" and 1998's Oscar-winning "Shakespeare in Love." In 2005 the brothers launched their own film production company, <span class="companylink">The Weinstein Company</span>.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel </div><div>275 words</div><div>26 July 2017</div><div>18:30</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales and prices increased across New York City during the second quarter, with activity in Brooklyn and Queens far outpacing that of Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan, which remains the most expensive borough, accounted for more than half of the $13.4 billion in total sales during the second quarter, according to a report by the Real Estate Board of New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other boroughs are gaining. Sales rose 17% in Queens and 15% in Brooklyn in the second quarter compared with the same quarter in 2016. Manhattan sales, lagging the rest of the city, were up 6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall the report found that the number of homes sold, including both apartment and house sales, increased 15%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report put the median home price at $630,000 in the city, up 8% from the same quarter last year. The median price in Manhattan of $1.115 million rose 5%, less than all other boroughs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price in Brooklyn jumped 17% to $775,000, while Queens rose 7% to $481,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales outside Manhattan, where prices are lower, have fueled healthy year-over-year average sales price growth, said John Banks, president of the Real Estate Board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rebound reflects renewed confidence in the economy, following the uncertainty of the presidential elections, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The luxury Manhattan housing market rebounded earlier than other segments of the market and in the other boroughs.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto and Sarah Chaney </div><div>817 words</div><div>26 July 2017</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shortage of new single-family homes across the U.S. is pushing up prices and locking many buyers out of the market. The silver lining: a boom in renovations of existing homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans are expected to pour a record $316 billion into home remodeling this year, up from $296 billion a year earlier, according to Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The burst of renovations has been a boon for contractors as well as big home-improvement companies, which have enjoyed strong revenue growth even as most other retailers are struggling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also reflects rising home prices and growing consumer confidence, as people are once again willing to invest in their homes, either through savings or by tapping home equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We turn away as much work as we do," said Bill Halliday, owner of Home Improvements of Vero Beach, in Florida. "It used to be you could call me and I could get somebody to you in a couple of days. Now I can get somebody to you in four or five weeks."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts polled by FactSet expect <span class="companylink">Lowe's Cos</span>. to post adjusted earnings on a per-share basis of $4.62 in its current fiscal year, up from $3.99 a year earlier. <span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>. is forecast to post earnings of $7.24 in its fiscal year, up from $6.45 a year prior. The earnings results would be the highest level recorded in data back to 2004, according to FactSet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But economists caution that the current boom is unlike earlier ones in that it is largely a reflection of a broken housing market. Many Americans are electing to stay put rather than trade up because the inventory of affordable homes is so small.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, there are about as many homes for sale in the U.S. today as there were in 1994, but there are 63 million more people, according to Zillow Chief Economist Svenja Gudell. Ms. Gudell called the inventory shortage a crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales declined 1.8% in June from the previous month, driven by a shortage of inventory, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday. Home prices have continued to climb faster than incomes because demand is far outstripping supply. The S&amp;PCoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index rose 5.6% in the 12 months ended in May, according to a Tuesday report, matching the April increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply squeeze is bad news for the overall U.S. economy because renovations are less of an economic engine than new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout much of the housing downturn and recovery, Americans invested little in their homes, in part because they had lost value. At the bottom of the home-renovation market in 2009, Americans spent $222 billion on renovations, or about 30% less than today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resurgence is being driven by several market trends. Rising home prices are boosting confidence and making people more willing to spend on big-ticket items like full kitchen remodels and additions. The average household expenditure on home renovations increased 57% in the last 12 months, according to HomeAdvisor, a website for homeowners and contractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's slim pickings out there," said Brad Hunter, chief economist at HomeAdvisor. "If they do find something, it's considerably more expensive than they expected it to be," forcing them to compromise on the size or location of the house, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjusted for inflation, U.S. spending on home renovations remains below the peak in 2006, when rising home prices prompted millions of Americans to refinance their homes and pour that money into elaborate upgrades. Adjusted for inflation, home renovation spending that year was roughly equivalent to $334 billion, according to Harvard.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who's Driving the</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction Craze?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two big demographic groups, baby boomers and millennials, are driving a recent home-improvement craze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baby boomers are staying in their homes longer than previous generations, in part because they are in better health and in part because the competition for smaller homes is so fierce. At the top of their renovation lists are accessibility features such as ramps, elevators and railings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a survey by <span class="companylink">Houzz</span>, a home-renovation website, roughly 60% of boomers are planning to stay in their homes for the next five years and an additional 20% said they are undecided -- one of the reasons it is so difficult for buyers to trade up, according to <span class="companylink">Houzz</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The millennials buying homes are often investing in older properties that need a significant amount of work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are two 900-pound gorillas," said Brad Hunter, chief economist at HomeAdvisor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The baby boomer generation and the millennials are both having really dramatic impacts at the same time," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of previously owned U.S. homes fell in June and prices jumped as strong demand overwhelmed a pinched supply of available homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales fell 1.8% in June from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.52 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday. The median sales price in June hit a record of $263,800, up 6.5% from a year earlier. Adjusted for inflation, prices remained about 9% below the 2006 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales have essentially been flat since March, when home purchases reached the highest level since 2007. A number of indicators suggest demand is surging because of a strong economy and millennials entering the housing market in force for the first time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But severe supply shortages are depressing sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The demand for buying a home is as strong as it has been since before the Great Recession. Listings in the affordable price range continue to be scooped up rapidly, but the severe housing shortages inflicting many markets are keeping a large segment of would-be buyers on the sidelines," said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a 4.3-month supply of homes on the market at the end of the month, down from 4.6 months a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers are looking to make purchases, according to economists and recent housing-market data, but are finding few affordably priced homes. Owners, meanwhile, have been more inclined to stay put and renovate rather than brave bidding wars and prices that are significantly higher than what they paid a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The musical chairs phenomenon of people not wanting to actually list their own home because they don't want to be buyers again means that they have to make their own homes work," said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at home listings site Zillow.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taiwan's <span class="companylink">Foxconn Technology</span> Group, which assembles <span class="companylink">Apple Inc</span>.'s iPhones, is nearing a decision to invest in Wisconsin and could hold an event in Washington, D.C., as soon as this week to discuss U.S. investment plans, people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Wisconsin, Foxconn is looking at producing display panels that can be used in large-screen television sets, three people briefed on the plans said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investment, if confirmed, would be the latest by Asian manufacturers in the U.S. as President Donald Trump seeks to revive manufacturing there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foxconn, formally known as <span class="companylink">Hon Hai Precision Industry Co</span>., has said publicly that it is looking at seven states in the U.S.[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/foxconn-in-talks-with-u-s-states-over-new-plant-1498105489], where it would invest a total of $10 billion or more to manufacture flat-panel screens and related equipment. In June, a company executive identified the seven as Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to Wisconsin, Foxconn is looking in the Detroit area for a possible plant, two people familiar with the plans said. It wasn't clear what that plant would make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The people cautioned that a final decision hasn't been set and that Foxconn could make last-minute changes. They said Foxconn was contemplating events in Washington, D.C., and Wisconsin to discuss its plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an emailed statement, Foxconn said it was reviewing "potential locations for establishing manufacturing facilities in the U.S." but declined to name them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, Foxconn Chief Executive Terry Gou said his company would work with <span class="companylink">Sharp Corp</span>., a Japanese electronics maker in which Foxconn acquired a controlling stake last year, to develop U.S. manufacturing plans. A Sharp spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gou has been meeting U.S. political leaders to discuss possible sites, people familiar with the talks said. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican who represents a district in southeastern Wisconsin, said earlier this month that he has met Foxconn officials[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8lUQfHEdTI].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foxconn is the world's largest electronics contract manufacturer, assembling iPhones, videogame machines and other products. Its factories are mostly in China, and previous discussions to expand manufacturing to the U.S. haven't materialized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2013, Foxconn said it might invest $40 million in Pennsylvania for manufacturing and research facilities. In 2014, Mr. Gou said he was studying the feasibility of an advanced-display manufacturing plant in the U.S., because it was expensive to ship large-screen TV sets from Asia. Neither idea made headway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foxconn is building an $8.8 billion flat-panel factory in southern China's Guangzhou province, where the company will build advanced liquid-crystal displays with technology from Sharp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharp's display panels are used in a wide variety of products including large-screen TV sets, smartphones and tablet computers.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a Victim of Gacy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Law enforcement has identified one of the seven remaining unnamed victims of John Wayne Gacy, the Chicago-area community volunteer and clown performer who killed 33 teenage boys and young men from 1972 to 1978.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 8.3% in June from May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.215 million, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Residential building permits, which can signal how much construction is in the pipeline, increased 7.4% to an annual pace of 1.254 million last month. That was the largest one-month jump since November 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, home construction showed strong momentum in the first half of the year. Housing starts in the first six months of 2017 were up 3.9% from the 2016 period. Permits during this period increased 6% from a year earlier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOVERNMENT TRANSACTION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. Has $2.39 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trump Tower Lease</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> is paying more than $130,000 a month to lease space in Trump Tower for the military office that supports the White House, even though Donald Trump hasn't spent a night at the New York skyscraper since becoming president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government signed a $2.39 million lease to rent a 3,475 sq. ft. space in the building for the military from April 11, 2017, to Sept. 30, 2018, nearly 18 months in total, according to lease documents that The Wall Street Journal obtained through a freedom of information request.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government agreed to pay $180,000 for the last 20 days of April 2017 and $130,000 a month thereafter, according to the contract released by the <span class="companylink">General Services Administration</span>, the agency that negotiates office space agreements for the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">GSA</span> redacted large portions of the lease, including the name of the person who owns the Trump Tower space the government is renting. A Pentagon official wrote in a letter seen by the Journal that the space is owned privately by someone unaffiliated with the <span class="companylink">Trump Organization</span> and that the department sees no way in which Mr. Trump can benefit from the rent money. Records indicate the owner is Joel R. Anderson, Mr. Trump's neighbor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The military's lease in Trump Tower puts the space far above market rate for similarly sized apartments in the luxury high rise market and makes it one of the most expensive residential rentals in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. military uses the White House Military Office to provide medical, food, transportation and communications services that by regulation need to be close to the president at all times. The military also ensures that the so-called nuclear football -- the briefcase that allows the president to authorize a nuclear attack -- accompanies the commander in chief during his travels. Its operations are separate from those of the Secret Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rental figure, which hasn't been disclosed previously, is only for the <span class="companylink">Defense Department</span>. Other agencies, such as the <span class="companylink">U.S. Secret Service</span>, also face increased costs stemming from Mr. Trump's frequent visits to his other properties and his large family.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate's labor committee approved two Republicans whom President Donald Trump nominated for vacant spots on the <span class="companylink">National Labor Relations Board</span> on a party-line vote Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Attorneys Marvin Kaplan and William Emanuel were both advanced on 12-11 votes for seats on the five-member board that referees disputes between unions and employers. Both men still face a confirmation vote in the full Senate, but the committee vote suggests they will face little resistance in the Republican-controlled Senate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democrats, who hold two of the three currently filled seats on the board, still control the body. Mr. Trump has elevated the sole Republican, Philip Miscimarra, to chairman. That move slowed issuance of agency decisions, since Mr. Miscimarra can control which cases are decided but lacks the votes to win rulings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kaplan is counsel at the independent <span class="companylink">Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission</span>. Previously, he worked as counsel for House Republicans on the Education and the Workforce Committee. Mr. Emanuel is a Los Angeles attorney at the <span class="companylink">Littler Mendelson</span> law firm who mainly represents large employers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some business groups have expressed concern about lingering vacancies on the board, one of several Washington bodies without a full complement of appointed officials.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congressional Republicans by mid-August hope to overturn a rule put in place by a consumer regulator that could make it easier for consumers to band together and sue banks to resolve disputes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) said he is working to get enough Senate votes to kill the arbitration rule under a legislative tool called the Congressional Review Act. Mr. Cotton is a leader in the party's efforts to thwart the <span class="companylink">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span> rule, which bans fine print in financial services contracts requiring arbitration. The CFPB rule will become effective in 60 days and binding in March next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cotton said he was "pretty hopeful" the Senate will pass the resolution before its summer recess, currently expected to start in mid-August. The House is expected to approve its version of the bill next week.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 8.3% in June from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.215 million, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is one of the best new housing construction reports that I've seen in a while," said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. Starts data are volatile from month to month and are subject to large revisions. The 8.3% gain in starts came with a 15.8-point margin of error.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of construction had been sluggish in recent months, with starts declining in the previous three months, and permits down in April and May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But economists said that was likely because a warm winter pushed up some activity by a month or two and that the overall trend remains toward continued improvement in the construction sector. "Housing has been a major concern as construction was on the downslide through the spring. That pattern was broken as builders picked up the pace quite sharply in June," said Joel Naroff, president and chief economist of Naroff Economic Advisors.</p>
