<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices increased at a slightly faster rate in October, the latest sign the housing market is firming after weakness earlier in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the U.S., rose 3.3% in October on an annual basis. That was a marginally greater increase than the 3.2% year-over-year rise during September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The acceleration in home-price growth during October coincides with other data pointing to a pickup in home sales during the second half of the year, amid mortgage rates that are low by historical standards and steady economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"October's U.S. housing data continue to be reassuring," said Craig J. Lazzara, a managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. "With October's 3.3% increase in the national composite index, home prices are currently more than 15% above the pre-financial crisis peak reached July 2006."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices were up 2.2%, year over year, in large metro areas in a 20-city composite index tracked by S&amp;P, a smaller increase than the rise nationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Phoenix area saw the biggest price increases among the 20 large metro areas, with prices up 5.8% year over year. The Southeast region also saw strong gains, according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report from the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> released Tuesday also showed home prices were up 0.2%[https://www.fhfa.gov/AboutUs/Reports/Pages/FHFA-House-Price-Index-October-2019.aspx] nationally in October from the previous month and up 5.0% from the previous October. The National Association of Realtors said earlier this month that existing-home sales were up 2.7%[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-decreased-1-7-in-november-11576767884] in November from a year earlier, the fifth straight month of year-over-year gains.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of Manhattan apartments, including new development, fell to $999,000 in each of the past two quarters. PHOTO: Caitlin Ochs for Wall Street Journal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2019 market for Manhattan residential real estate was one of the worst in nearly a decade, data show, with some brokers walking away from their jobs because of a sales slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing Manhattan apartments this year fell to the slowest pace since 2011, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of city property records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall apartment prices tumbled to a four-year low in the third quarter, and remained at the same low levels in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slumping resales make up 80% of transactions in Manhattan and are at the heart of the brokerage business for many New York brokers. New condo sales rose sharply as buildings were completed, but many of those sales went into contract years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a difficult year and one of the most difficult years of my career," said Leonard Steinberg, a broker at Compass with $3 billion in sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frederick Peters, the chief executive of Warburg Realty, said some less-seasoned agents were "walking away from the industry" because of the sales slowdown. "It is very hard to make a living these days," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One corner of the market, though, set record highs: home sales for at least $25 million. Multimillionaires and billionaires purchased 56 apartments and townhouses at that price point, the most in any year, including a $240 million condo at 220 Central Park South that is the most expensive home[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/billionaire-ken-griffin-buys-americas-most-expensive-home-for-238-million-11548271301] sold in the U.S. Of these, 18 were in resales of older homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were a few signs of optimism for the 2020 market. Mr. Peters said that newer listings are coming on at more reasonable prices and asking prices on older listings are being cut, making it more likely that buyers will finally pounce. "Every day we get hordes of emails about price reductions, 20 to 25 a day."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Donna Olshan, a Manhattan broker who tracks the luxury market, said there was a rebound in contracts signed for properties listed for $4 million or more in November and December, with December sales the strongest in three years in what she called a "Santa Claus relief rally" set off by price cutting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she said the number of such contracts signed in the fourth quarter this year lagged behind the fourth quarter of 2018 by 7%, and properties that went into contract were on the market for an average of 496 days, an 11% increase from the same period in 2018, and a 56% increase from 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of contracts reported signed in new developments for $4 million or more also fell, by 35% in 2019, compared with 2018, because condo developers were reluctant to cut asking prices, she said. "It's a fragile market by any measure and mostly comes down to one thing: price," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market decline was stunning, said Gregory J. Heym, chief economist at Halstead and Brown Harris Stevens, because it occurred at the same time the economy has been strong, unemployment is at the lowest level in 50 years[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/november-jobs-report-11575633600?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=17))///], wages have been rising, and the stock market has climbed to multiple records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Usually apartment prices only come down this much in a recession, when people are worried about their jobs and their investments," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he said the Manhattan market has been beset by other issues, including higher transfer taxes on the sale of properties selling for $2 million[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/manhattan-buyers-rush-to-beat-new-mansion-tax-11561903320] or more, as well as the lingering impact of federal tax changes that reduced the deductibility of state and local taxes and increased the costs of owning homes in high-tax localities such as New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said fears of a recession that hasn't happened also chilled sales in 2019, as did uncertainty about the direction of the country. Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc., said he expected a slowdown next year as the presidential election moves forward. It is a period of "peak uncertainty," Mr. Miller said. "Rational thinking does not apply," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A change in the state transfer tax caused a surge in sales and prices during the second quarter, because of a rush to close by buyers and sellers of expensive properties[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/tax-dodging-made-june-a-record-month-for-luxury-real-estate-11565175603] trying to beat the tax. In the third quarter these sales tumbled, but rather than rebounding toward the end of year, sales of existing apartments drifted lower, the WSJ analysis found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These were offset in 2019 by a 33% surge of condominium sales in new buildings, including more than 400 closings at just two buildings: One Manhattan Square, a glass tower on the Lower East Side; and 15 Hudson Yards, a glass tower on the far West Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of Manhattan apartments, including new development, fell to $999,000 in each of the past two quarters. It hadn't been below $1 million since the third quarter of 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a Manhattan condo was $1.58 million, and the median price of a cooperative apartment was $799,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a bright note, sales of older lower-price apartments—those below $1 million—rose 5.8% in the fourth quarter, compared with a year earlier, as buyers were drawn into the market by lower mortgage interest rates this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But brokers are worried. Bess Freedman, CEO of Brown Harris Stevens, said plans by some legislators to impose an annual pied-à-terre tax on nonresident homeowners could kill much of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It will destroy our industry and kill a lot of jobs," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though she described the market as "in oversupply mode," she said it could be attractive to some buyers. "For buyers, I call this an opportunity market," she said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Candace Taylor </div><div>1660 words</div><div>27 December 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the dawn of this decade, the U.S. was reeling from a real-estate crash and the worst economic downturn since the Depression. Home prices in some regions were starting to recover, but it seemed impossible that values would return anytime soon to their dizzying boomtime highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few could have predicted that within a few years, the luxury market would not only recover but reach a staggering new height. A tidal wave of global wealth poured into U.S. real estate after the 2007-09 recession, creating in the 2010s a new segment of the market: ultraluxury homes targeted at the global billionaire elite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pricier and more lavish than anything that came before them, these homes had outsized amenities such as commercial-grade hair salons, hotel-worthy spas and home theaters with concession stands. As the extreme became commonplace, homeowners began to add more attention-grabbing features, such as shark tanks and private nightclubs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, luxury-condominium buildings grew taller than ever. Standing 1,550-feet high with 131 stories, Central Park Tower in Manhattan is now the tallest residential building in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, because so many buyers are wealthy enough to withstand the most severe economic swings, this new sector largely acts independently from the broader real-estate market. So while the number of sales is falling in many luxury markets across the country, six homes in the U.S. have closed for $100 million or more so far in 2019 -- the highest number for a single year. In 2010, there were none. That year, the highest sale price was $50 million (plus about $2 million of furnishings) for Le Belvedere, a Bel-Air mansion with a swan pond and a ballroom that could seat more than 200 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People don't realize that there are two markets happening in the world," said Oren Alexander, an agent at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>. "We've been hearing that things have slowed down, and that's true -- no doubt about it. But the unique, one-of-a-kind, top-notch product? That market is doing better than ever."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales of $50 million or more used to be an anomaly, with two or less each year in the early 2000s, according to Miller Samuel, a residential appraisal and consulting company. In 2014, that figure spiked to 23, and hasn't fallen below 12 since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Angeles, the average home-sales price soared 153% to $2.5 million between the third quarter of 2009 and the same quarter of 2019, according to Miller Samuel. Florida's ritzy barrier island of Palm Beach saw its average home price surge 77% in that same period, while Miami's jumped 72%. Manhattan, which has stumbled in recent years, still had an average sales price of $1.65 million in the third quarter, 25% higher than the same quarter 10 years earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade that will be remembered for its excesses, the 2010s saw the first-ever condo sales topping $100 million, then $200 million. In the 2010s, billionaires bought not just one, but multiple $100 million-plus homes for themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers paid tens of millions of dollars for houses, only to raze them and build brand-new mansions in their place. They bought newly constructed, multimillion-dollar condos and gut-renovated them, putting existing high-end finishes out with the trash. They upholstered their walls in red leather from the uber-luxury handbag brand Hermes. The youngest members of the family got playhouses that cost more than conventional homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The postrecession flood of buyers has now slowed, and far more home sellers seek nine-figure price tags than actually achieve them. Still, it is clear that ultraluxury sales are now a fixture of the marketplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $100 million sale "is now a thing," said real-estate appraiser Jonathan Miller of Miller Samuel. "This will not go away."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 2010s, hedge-fund billionaire Ken Griffin poured at least $820 million into home purchases in New York, Palm Beach, Chicago and London. Since 2011, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has spent at least $250 million on real estate. Embattled WeWork founder Adam Neumann has paid about $90 million for six homes since 2012, including a California estate with a guitar-shaped living room. Natural gas billionaire Michael S. Smith paid $110 million in 2018 for an oceanfront compound on Malibu's Carbon Beach. What Mr. Smith paid is more than 1,500 times the U.S. median household income for that year, or $63,179, according to census data. It's enough to buy 550 Ferraris, or more than 450 houses priced at $243,225, the current median value of a home in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These are numbers that mere mortals don't pay for housing," said Mr. Miller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How did we get here?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 2010, Uber and <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> were fledgling startups. <span class="companylink">Instagram</span> had just launched. Many people used <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span> primarily for buying books. Many tech companies have seen expansive growth since then, yielding massive amounts of wealth for their founders. Meanwhile, vast fortunes were created in emerging economies across the world, such as China, Russia and Brazil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Over the last 10 years, we've seen a recovery from the financial crisis and a long boom in stock prices," said Maya Imberg, director of Thought Leadership and Analytics at Wealth-X. "That's pushed up the overall amount of wealth in the world."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, there were 174,000 people world-wide with a net worth of $30 million or more, according to Wealth-X. By 2019, that number had jumped to 275,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This generation of affluent people has eagerly purchased luxury real estate in their home countries and around the world to diversify their assets or escape political instability at home, said Liam Bailey, head of Knight Frank's residential-research team. "Wealth has become much more mobile," he said. "The new wealth that has been created in emerging markets in particular has a very global outlook."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, he added, international ultrahigh-net-worth individuals typically have at least three or four homes in multiple cities outside their home country. With interest rates low after the financial crisis, "investors were running around the globe investing in real estate as a way to generate higher returns," Mr. Miller said. "It was a frenzy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key turning point came in 2012, when former Citigroup Chairman Sandy Weill sold his penthouse at Manhattan's 15 Central Park West for $88 million -- roughly twice what he had paid for it in 2007 -- to Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev. That deal "opened up a whole new echelon of what could be," said Corcoran chief executive Pamela Liebman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With land prices high and credit tight in the wake of the recession, developers buoyed by investment dollars built almost exclusively high-end product, Mr. Miller said. The result was an "explosion of luxury new builds" in cities such as New York, London and Los Angeles, said Mr. Bailey, reversing an earlier trend where buyers would pay a premium for established, old-money buildings. "It almost created a brand-new marketplace."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan, for example, new-construction luxury towers like One57 sprang up on what is now called Billionaires' Row, taking advantage of new technology to build taller buildings than ever before as they competed to lure wealthy international buyers. "You've got this arms race between developers, who are using architecture and design to stand out from the crowd," Mr. Bailey said. "You end up with these incredible buildings."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2014, tech entrepreneur Michael Dell set a new Manhattan record when he bought a condo at One57 for $100.47 million. In 2015, an investor group led by billionaire hedge-fund manager William Ackman paid $91.5 million for another unit in the same building. In 2017, an unknown buyer paid $91.1 million for a penthouse at 432 Park Avenue, a nearly 1,400-foot-high tower on Billionaires' Row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The past decade will be known for redefining luxury, as developers sought to wow buyers by piling on the most over-the-top features. "The amenities have doubled and quadrupled," said Manhattan real-estate agent Richard Steinberg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the decade when sellers put homes on the market with Lamborghinis, Warhols and Picassos included in the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the decade when Miami's Porsche Design Tower was built with glass-walled garages adjacent to the units and accessed by a specially designed car elevator, allowing residents to park just outside their apartments, even 60 stories in the air.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2017, a Beverly Hills spec house was listed for $100 million with a Champagne vault filled with 170 bottles of Cristal, and a full-time house manager whose salary had been prepaid for two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That same year, a Los Angeles spec house dubbed Billionaire hit the market with two fully stocked wine cellars, a candy room filled with treats from Dylan's Candy Bar and an elevator clad in crocodile skin. The lower level had a four-lane bowling alley with bowling shoes in various sizes. The house sold this year for $94 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Boston, the under-construction St. Regis Residences will offer buyers personal butler service and the option of having a watch-winder in the closet. "Always reliable and faithful, your butler will come to understand your exact preferences and even anticipate your needs," the website boasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Features now routine in high-end properties, like home automation systems, were considered, not long ago, to be "super luxury and unattainable to the average person," said real-estate agent Catherine Marcus Bassick. "What defined luxury in 2009 is not the luxury we would describe now."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Will Parker </div><div>728 words</div><div>26 December 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home builders benefited from low interest rates this year as housing starts climbed to levels not seen in a decade and new-home sales surged after a disappointing 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builder confidence, as measured by the National <span class="companylink">Association of Home Builders</span>, is now the highest since 1999. And publicly traded home-builder stocks beat the S&amp;P 500 average this year, rising 40% as of Monday, compared with the broad index's 29% gain over the period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders cranked up volume partly by focusing on homes more buyers can afford. Large builders including <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">MDC Holdings Inc</span>. made strategic shifts to produce a higher number of less expensive homes, targeted at a generation of millennials with lower purchasing power than average buyers in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the third quarter of this year, the average price of a <span class="companylink">Meritage</span> home fell 4.4% while the number of home orders rose 24%, driven by demand in the entry-level category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're seeing shifts down in average price," said Jonathan Boise, a home-builder analyst at <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>. "Typically, for the builders that are focusing on entry-level product, that's resulting in stronger growth than their peers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong buyer demand for more affordable homes stoked mergers and acquisitions. In November, <span class="companylink">Taylor Morrison Home Corp</span>. said it would purchase a West Coast competitor, <span class="companylink">William Lyon Homes</span>, a company that does more than half of its business in the entry-level market. Scheduled to close in 2020 and valued at $2.4 billion, the deal was among the largest announced in the industry this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some builders and analysts question whether growth will continue at the current pace next year. Fitch predicts new-home sales will grow only 1.5%, compared with 9% in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates are expected to remain low, meaning mortgage costs will still be cheaper than in 2018, a continued incentive for more buyers to come into the market. And <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> forecasts that housing-construction starts will increase 10% next year to reach a postrecession high, giving supply a needed boost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But cost increases fueled by labor shortages and regulatory challenges are making it harder to deliver homes with affordable price tags, according to builders. Labor costs are going up partly because home builders are having a hard time recruiting workers in a strong economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're fighting the agriculture industry, the restaurant industry for the same people," said Chuck Fowke, a custom-home builder in Tampa, Fla. "Today, you've got a lot of young people going to work for <span class="companylink">FedEx</span> or <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>, and a lot of times in our industry there aren't benefits available for entry-level people that are starting out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, residential-construction workers are more likely to be older than the workforce at large, and the industry continues to be short 300,000 to 400,000 workers in any given month, according to Robert Dietz, the National <span class="companylink">Association of Home Builders</span>' chief economist. Worker productivity in the sector has been mostly flat for more than two decades, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trade concerns remain a problem for the industry. Although lumber prices have since fallen, a 2018 price increase related to the Trump administration's Canadian tariffs was enough to raise the average home construction cost by $9,000, according to the group. "Those tariffs are still in place," Mr. Dietz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next year could be riskier for home builders as more companies move to meet demand from entry-level shoppers, who "typically look for homes that could be delivered within a short period," according to a recent Fitch report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To meet demand, some home builders are planning to build more "on spec," building homes that don't yet have buyers, as opposed to building based on customer orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks in part to the industry's strong showing in 2019, analysts said mergers and acquisitions could continue in 2020, with publicly traded builders accounting for a greater share of total home-building. Fitch expects regional builders focused on the entry level to be attractive targets for acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large builders are looking at companies with landholdings that are legally ready to be developed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. business investment remained sluggish late this year, though progress on trade deals and an improving global economy hold promise for a pickup in 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key proxy for business investment -- orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- rose 0.1% in November from October, the Commerce Department said Monday. Such orders rose 0.5% from a year earlier, the first year-over-year improvement for the gauge since June -- but still well below the pace of inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not a disaster," Capital Economics economist Paul Ashworth wrote in a note to clients. "But business equipment investment was still close to stagnant."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak business investment was a drag on U.S. economic growth in the second and third quarters and is likely to do little to support growth in the fourth quarter, which ends next week. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta</span> on Monday projected the U.S. economy would grow at a 2.3% pace in the fourth quarter, with business investment nearly flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are prospects for an improvement in business investment next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's data reflected orders placed in November, ahead of a string of economic news in recent weeks that was largely seen as positive for manufacturers. That included progress in trade talks between the U.S. with China, completion of a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico, and <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> policy makers saying they intend to maintain the current low level of interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The easing of trade tensions. . .between the U.S. and China might ease some of the uncertainty, and lead to an improvement in this area," Michael Moran, an economist at Daiwa Capital Markets, wrote to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall orders for durable goods fell 2% from the prior month. Much of the decline was due to a sharp pullback in orders for military equipment. Last week, Congress passed a defense-spending bill that could stoke defense demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before November, demand for long-lasting goods had been trending higher since June, an improvement from the first half of the year. A persistent weak spot, however, has been the volatile civilian-aircraft category. Orders for nondefense airplanes and parts were down 26% from a year earlier in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Boeing Co</span>., the nation's largest aircraft maker, has seen orders decline since its 737 MAX jetliner was grounded globally in March following two fatal crashes. The company said last week it planned to halt 737 MAX production in January, a move <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> economists estimated would subtract 0.5 percentage point from first-quarter 2020 economic growth. On Monday, the aerospace giant replaced its chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Commerce Department said sales of newly built, single-family homes rose 1.3% in November from the prior month, a sign the housing market is enjoying a long-awaited pickup amid low interest rates and steady economic growth. Sales are up about 10% through 11 months in 2019 from 2018.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department will report on durable-goods orders for November, a key snapshot of the factory sector's health. The report will also show a key measure of business investment, which has been weak this year. Economists believe overall orders rose 1.2% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department will also report on November sales of newly built homes, a slice of the housing market. Economists believe new-home sales fell 0.4% last month. Sales of existing homes—the majority of the market—fell last month from a month earlier, the National Association of Realtors reported last week.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House voted Thursday to repeal the cap on state and local tax deductions that was included in the 2017 tax overhaul, a symbolic step that Senate Republicans have declared dead on arrival.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 218-206 vote lets Democrats deliver a nod to voters in New Jersey, New York and California who oppose the cap and helped propel the party to the House majority in 2018. The initiative has slim chances for passage in the GOP-led Senate and the White House has threatened a veto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill would repeal the $10,000 cap on the federal deduction for state and local taxes for the next two years and set the limit at $20,000 for married couples for 2019. To pay for the temporary change, the measure would raise the top individual tax rate to 39.6% from 37% in the years 2020 through 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democrats accepted a late Republican proposal to keep the $10,000 limit in place for households with adjusted gross income over $100 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales are picking up in the second half of the year, a sign that low mortgage rates and a solid economy are helping to heat up the once-sluggish housing market going into next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales were up 2.7% in November from a year earlier, the fifth straight month of year-over-year gains, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home sales were down 1.7% compared with October at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.35 million, economists said there are fresh signs that buyers are becoming more confident after a lethargic first half of the year. Sales sputtered through most of the spring selling season, when activity is normally high, falling annually every month until the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, historically low mortgage interest rates and an increase in millennials looking to buy their first home are luring more buyers into the market. Millennials account for nearly half of home-purchase mortgage originations, according to data from Realtor.com. (News Corp, parent of The Wall Street Journal, operates Realtor.com under license from the National Association of Realtors.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. unemployment rate fell back to 3.5% in November, a 50-year low, and wage growth also has picked up modestly. The National <span class="companylink">Association of Home Builders</span> added to the upbeat mood on Monday when it reported its housing market index, which measures industry confidence, rose in December to its highest level since June 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph LaVorgna, Natixis chief economist for the Americas, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday that the improvement in home-builder sentiment is a positive sign for the broader economy heading into 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Residential construction activity should be a meaningful, positive, contributor to real [gross domestic product] growth next year," he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, others noted significant headwinds remain. The number of homes available remains low, economists say. That is especially true at the cheaper end of the housing market, as median home prices continue to rise in most parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales pace, there was a 3.7-month supply of homes on the market at the end of November, below 4.0 months at the same time last year. Limited housing stock has contributed to higher home prices this year, with the median sales price for an existing home in November up 5.4% on year at $271,300.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we were building more homes under $300,000, these [sales] numbers would be through the roof right now," said Robert Frick, an economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes sold in that price range continued to shrink, according to NAR's data. Sales of homes priced at $250,000 and below declined in November from a year ago, while sales of those in the $500,000-to-$750,000 range posted the strongest gains, rising 8.0%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The new-home construction seems to be coming to the market, but we are still not seeing the amount of construction needed to solve the housing shortage," Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, said in a news release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the average interest rate on a 30-year ﬁxed mortgage was 3.73% as of Dec. 12, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, up slightly from September's lows but below year-earlier levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low interest rates were one of the reasons that David Grant decided to buy a home this fall after a monthslong search in San Diego. Mr. Grant, a retail manager and writer, wanted to swap his rising rent with a mortgage payment on for a home priced around $500,000. But he was continually thwarted by higher bids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were going almost every day to look at houses," Mr. Grant said, recalling one tour that included squatters living in tents inside the home. "You make an offer, you get to the inspection, and there's an issue"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his fiancée eventually settled on a three-bedroom home with a basement apartment they could rent to Mr. Grant's brother. To make the mortgage, they obtained an FHA loan, requiring just 3.5% down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jodie Lee, a Redfin real-estate agent in San Diego, said more clients are looking for homes with adjacent apartments to rent out and help offset housing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the supply coming to market is dwindling, she said, as many homeowners are reluctant to sell on concerns they wouldn't be able come by a new, suitable home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They can't find something that checks all their boxes," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some see a reason for optimism in new-home construction, however, which could provide opportunities for first-time buyers as well those looking to "move-up," making more existing homes available for sale. In November, single-family housing starts rose to a rate of 918,000 units, the highest such number since July 2007.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Bloomfield </div><div>2017 words</div><div>18 December 2019</div><div>11:37</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are 37 total residences in the Twenty Grosvenor Square development, 75% of which have been sold. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that there were 37 residences left. (12/20/19)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Prime Minister Boris Johnson returns to Downing Street with a mandate to "Get Brexit Done," real-estate agents in prime central London (PCL), regardless of political affiliation, are breathing a collective sigh of relief. The political and economic volatility the U.K. has endured since voting to leave the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> has coincided with the disappearance of overseas buyers from London's market and falling prices. Now they believe that a deal—any deal—will help repair buyer confidence after years in limbo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A [Jeremy] Corbyn government would have likely decimated the prime sector overnight," said buying agent Edward Heaton, managing partner of Heaton &amp; Partners. "Many of our wealthiest clients, who had put in place contingency plans for a Labour majority, are now likely to reinvigorate their purchasing plans and start buying."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Brexit takes much of the blame for the travails of PCL, a "golden triangle" of real estate between the Notting Hill, Kensington, and Mayfair neighborhoods, it is only one factor. Exclusive research by <span class="companylink">Savills</span> on PCL real-estate prices shows that the area's profound market gyrations have been driven by winds that started howling long before the 2016 Brexit referendum. And in PCL, site of London's most expensive real estate, prices both rise faster and fall more dramatically than the mainstream market across the U.K.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, the average price of a prime London home was riding at a record high of £3.9 million ($5.2 million) after several years of strong growth. But the global economic crisis meant that by the start of 2009, the PCL average price had plummeted to £3 million ($4 million), a drop of around 25% in just two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An influx of foreign buyers pushed prices up again, and by the end of 2010, that average price was £4.1 million ($5.475 million). By early 2014, it hit a record £5.5 million ($7.34 million). But 2014 also brought a series of Stamp Duty increases that hit the top end of the market hard. Today, for instance, Stamp Duty is £153,750 ($205,318) on a home worth £2 million ($2.67 million), and £1,113,750 ($1.488 million) on a property worth £10 million ($13.35 million). Taxes are even higher for second homes. There is no annual property tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lucian Cook, head of residential research at <span class="companylink">Savills</span>, believes that along with these increasing buying costs, the prime central London market was simply "running out of steam" by 2014. "It had seen such a strong bounce back, I just think it had reached a natural peak and was looking quite expensive," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.K. market has fallen ever since, thanks in large part to a series of further hits, including the 2016 referendum on Europe, the 2017 general election, and the 2019 extensions to the Brexit negotiations, as the <span class="companylink">British government</span> struggled to agree on a deal with the <span class="companylink">EU</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of 2019, average prices for a prime central London home stood at £4.385 million ($5.855 million), a drop of more than 20% since 2014. Over the past 12 months, however, there have been some early signs of a price recovery. According to research by <span class="companylink">Strutt &amp; Parker</span> estate agents, the number of units sold was up 13.3% in 2019 Q3, compared with the same period in 2018. Driving this is the U.K. property market's affordability for foreign investors due to a weak pound, and its attractiveness as a safe financial haven. One buyer from Hong Kong spent £10.75 million ($14.36 million) last summer on a penthouse at the Corinthia Hotel London in Westminster, the biggest deal done in the area in five years, according to selling agent Aston Chase. And while prices have continued to fall in 2019, the rate of decline has slowed, <span class="companylink">Savills</span> found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Bill, head of London residential research at Knight Frank, suspects the immediate result of the general election will be a "settling down period" while sellers who have been sitting out the political chaos list their properties, increasing what has been an extremely short supply of homes. But he warns that a boost in inventory will bring its own challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"More supply would normally lead to downward pressure on prices," he said. "But sellers will expect a bounce. So you will have a period when the market would need to settle down and reprice. After a while you would expect transaction volumes to pick up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conservative victory isn't necessarily good news for overseas prime buyers. The value of the pound began to rise the instant the exit poll was released on the evening of the election, predicting Mr. Johnson's victory—although it retreated several days later when Mr. Johnson reiterated his commitment to Brexit with or without a deal. Mr. Johnson's election manifesto included a pledge to increase Stamp Duty once more, adding another 3% to the tax burden paid by overseas buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Camilla Dell, managing partner at Black Brick, a buying agency, says that this won't be a deal breaker given the significant pent-up demand she has witnessed. In the final quarter of 2019, she says she registered 100% more clients compared with the same time last year. The average budget per client rose from £4 million ($5.34 million) to £6.35 million ($8.48 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is unlikely to deter buyers at the top end of the market, who continue to benefit from [relatively] weak sterling and substantial price falls," she said. "Although the whole Brexit process has tarnished the U.K.'s reputation for sound governance, this should be put in context. As we've found throughout 2019, London remains a (comparative) beacon of stability and the rule of law compared with much of the Middle East and Africa and, latterly, with places such as Hong Kong."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cook believes that the plan to increase Stamp Duty for overseas buyers will spark a short-term rush to close deals before the tax is imposed. That date is expected to be revealed early next year. In the longer term, Mr. Cook believes that price rises will be a modest 3% in 2020 but, between 2020 and 2025, he thinks they will rise 20% once a trade deal has been hammered out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Hyman, head of residential at Cluttons estate agents, also forecasts a sedate recovery, pointing out that a prime London property is, by any normal measure, a very expensive buy. And it may be premature to call it a recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everyone thinks that prime central London is linked to Brexit," said Mr. Cook. "It is actually linked to transaction costs and affordability. It is not going to see peoples' earnings doubled overnight, and buying costs are not going to come down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying agent Roarie Scarisbrick, a partner at <span class="companylink">Property Vision</span>, says that "while we will be busy with buyers who have been sitting on their hands for a while, and transactions will pick up, the structural issues in the market remain the same and boom time is unlikely."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sellers will be rubbing their hands with glee today but I don't think this is a time to get greedy because again the issues remain the same and there are still choppy waters to cross with Brexit and Stamp Duty," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wither Luxury?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some luxury developments have been putting on a strong sales performance, particularly upscale residences with hotel facilities on tap. At Twenty Grosvenor Square, a boutique redevelopment of the former headquarters of the American Navy, in the Mayfair neighborhood, owners get use of a spa, wine cellar, pool, fitness center, child care facility and cinema at the first <span class="companylink">Four Seasons</span> stand-alone private residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The location and the brand have attracted buyers from Britain, North America, Europe, and India since the property went on sale in 2017. They have been undeterred by the £17.5 million ($23.37 million) starting price plus the annual service charge of £14.50 ($19.36) a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for the development said that about 75% of the development's 37 residences have been sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Former Barracks Transformed, Finally</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The long, slow redevelopment of Chelsea Barracks has been buffeted by the ups and downs of London's real-estate market—and the heir to the British throne.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Qatari Diar</span>, the Qatari royal family's property company, bought the site back in 2008. London's prime property market had been brought low by the property crash but <span class="companylink">Qatari Diar</span> correctly assumed that prices wouldn't stay down for long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm hired the starchitect Lord Richard Rogers, senior partner of Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners, to design a £3 billion ($4 billion) development of around 440 houses and apartments. Progress was delayed by an unprecedented royal intervention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, Prince Charles, an outspoken critic of modern architecture, wrote to the Qatari Royal family beseeching them not to build Lord Rogers' concept of a series of copper, glass and concrete pavilions in a historic neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anxious not to offend HRH's traditionalist sensibilities, a new architect was hired to draw up less contentious plans. Prince Charles' intervention caused a scandal, because members of the British royal family are not supposed to engage in this kind of direct "meddling" in planning matters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits were finally granted in 2011, during prime central London's vigorous recovery. But its first homes weren't put on sale until 2013, just as the prime property market began a long, slow decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Against this backdrop, work on Chelsea Barracks has proceeded fitfully. A spokeswoman confirmed that the early phases, totaling 81 homes, are now 75% sold. That means that about 60 homes have sold in six years and less than a fifth of the homes planned for the site have been built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another tranche of homes will go on sale in 2020 and the project is scheduled to be completed in 2023. But the spokeswoman couldn't confirm the timing of the subsequent phases which will "follow on as markets dictate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices start at £5.25 million ($7 million) for two-bedroom apartments and £38 million ($50.745 million) for townhouses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listings</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">£55 million ($73.45 million)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a buyer who needs space, this eight-bedroom, nine-bathroom townhouse measures 14,226 square feet across seven floors. The house is five minutes from Buckingham Palace, and close to two of London's Royal Parks. It has been newly refurbished with a media room, plus a basement level with bar, swimming pool, gym, and sauna.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agent: The Cloister</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">£25 million ($33.385 million)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This newly built house with ultracontemporary interiors is in the St. James's neighborhood. The striking black brick home has five bedrooms, seven bathrooms and measures 8,356 square feet, enough space for a club room, movie theater, spa, and sky lounge with retractable roof. Its price has recently been cut from £30 million ($40 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agent: Knight Frank</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">£14.75 million ($19.7 million)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This tall and skinny Georgian townhouse is in the fashionable Marylebone neighborhood, close to the West End, and near restaurants and shops. The 7,526-square-foot house is laid out over five floors with six bedrooms and four bathrooms. There is also a separate three-bedroom cottage, measuring 1,527 square feet, set at the end of the backyard.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week's calendar brings new data on manufacturing for both the U.S. and China, as well as U.S. home sales and November consumer spending and inflation data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China releases industrial-production data for November, expected to show value-added industrial output rising 5% over the previous year, up from October's 4.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> releases November industrial-production data, a closely watched manufacturing gauge. The measure has declined in three of the past four months, due to the trade war and the global slowdown. Analysts expect a 0.8% increase, which could suggest the gloom is lifting at factories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department releases October data on job openings, hires and separations, which could show a rebound from September's decline in openings. But September's report also showed there are more open positions than unemployed workers available to fill them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales picked up in October but November data released by the National Association of Realtors is expected to show a decline to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.44 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department releases November consumer spending data which could offer an early assessment of this year's holiday spending season. Analysts expect a 0.4% increase over the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department also releases the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s preferred inflation gauge for November, expected to show a 1.6% year-over-year increase.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>. tempered its sales targets for next year, saying the long U.S. economic expansion is expected to cool and the home-improvement chain will need more time for some investments to pay off in sales gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's 2020 forecast reflects slower growth in gross domestic product and a housing market that is positive but "not at a level that we've seen in prior years," Chief Executive Craig Menear told investors on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We will continue to gain outsized share in our market," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buoyed by a strong housing market and low unemployment, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> has enjoyed several years of robust sales growth even as some retailers, including its rival <span class="companylink">Lowe's Cos</span>., have struggled. More recently, its growth has slowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For fiscal 2020, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> said it expects total sales and comparable sales to rise by 3.5% to 4%. Analysts polled by FactSet, on average, were expecting same-store sales to increase 4.3%. Two years ago, executives were projecting comparable sales would rise 4.5% to 6% in 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlanta-based company, which operates nearly 2,300 stores, has missed same-store sales expectations for the last four fiscal quarters, according to FactSet, and hasn't reported annual same-store sales below 4% since fiscal 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> executives said heading into 2020, U.S. consumer spending is healthy, boosted by low unemployment and rising wages. They also said the overall housing market is healthy, making Americans more willing to spend on improvements.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth was greatest in Sunbelt cities, such as Phoenix, where prices grew 6% in September. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that home prices increased most in Tampa. (Nov.26, 2019)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth accelerated in September, marking two-straight months of price increases after a long period of decelerating gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 3.2% annually, up from 3.1% the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results, which coincide with an  increase in sales of existing homes [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-increased-1-9-in-october-11574348528], indicated that low mortgage interest rates continue to make an impact on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"September's report for the U.S. housing market is reassuring," said Craig J. Lazzara, a managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. "It is, of course, too soon to say whether this month marks an end to the deceleration or is merely a pause in the longer-term trend."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price growth was greatest in Sunbelt cities, according to the report, such as Phoenix, where prices grew 6% from September of 2018. Prices declined in just one of the 20-city composite index tracked by S&amp;P, San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report released by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> on Tuesday also showed prices increased nationally in September. Last week, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes rose 1.9% in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home prices grew 3.2% nationally in September, they rose more modestly—2.1%—in large metro areas tracked in the 20-city composite index.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Will Parker and Amara Omeokwe </div><div>901 words</div><div>21 November 2019</div><div>10:02</div><div>WSJ Pro Central Banking</div><div>RSTPROCB</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2019, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of higher-priced homes picked up last month, but those involving starter homes and others aimed at lower- and middle-income buyers were slowed by a lack of inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Existing-home sales rose 1.9% in October [https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/existing-home-sales-climb-1-9-in-october] from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.46 million, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast a 1.5% rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On an annual basis, sales in October increased 4.6% from the same month the previous year, marking the fourth straight month of year-over-year gains. September sales were revised down to 5.36 million, compared to an earlier estimate of a 5.38 million pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">October's gains were most robust near the top of the housing market. Homes in the $500,000 to $750,000 range experienced the strongest improvement in October versus a year ago, while sales of homes priced below $250,000 declined. The decline in lower-priced homes was greatest on the West Coast, where sales of homes priced between $100,000 and $250,000 fell 19.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lack of inventory has helped drive up home prices up this year. At the current sales pace, there was a 3.9 month-supply of homes on the market at the end of October, according to NAR estimates, a lower supply than the same time last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The buyers are coming back, but the lack of inventory is pushing up prices, in my view, way too fast," said Lawrence Yun, the trade group's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median-sales price for an existing home in October was $270,900, up 6.2% from the previous year. That was the strongest price appreciation since June 2017, according to the NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than a third of sales in October involved first-time buyers, a figure that has not changed much during 2019, suggesting that the recent increase in sales is mostly driven by those who have previously owned their home, according to Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American Financial Corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Existing home owners are all selling to each other and are leaving the first-time home buyers out in the cold. That's why we can see more home sales even though inventory went down," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A significant contributor to the inventory and price problems is the length of time homeowners are staying in their homes before moving. Americans now live in their home for five years longer than they did just a decade ago, according to a recent analysis by the real-estate brokerage Redfin. That makes it harder for would-be, first-time homebuyers to find a place they can afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowing conditions for home buyers are generally good. While mortgage rates have ticked up in recent months, they remain low by historical standards. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stood at 3.75% at the end of last week, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However if mortgage interest rates rise from historical lows, homeowners could be less inclined to sell because they are "locked-in" to cheaper mortgage payments, Mr. Fleming said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kerron Stokes, a RE/Max agent in Denver, Colo., said some homeowners have taken advantage of low rates to reinvest in their house through renovations. But more recently he's started to notice that homes on the market are in shabbier condition than what they had been just a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People last year were more competitive in the market and would put up $20,000 into renovating a bathroom. Now people are taking a look at the same amount of money and saying, ‘that's $20,000 we're going to need for equity in the next house.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Greenville, S.C., retired Navy nurse Virginia Howard and her husband have been looking for a one-story, brick home for a year now. Nothing that matches their $400,000 price target has met the couple's expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some of the homes that are right at half a million dollars are just in very poor shape," she said. "You start talking half a million dollars, I expect to go into a home that is very updated."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Angeles, just 6% of homes are affordable to the median renter, according to Mr. Fleming. "And a lot of those are homes you probably don't want to buy," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some positive indicators for inventory coming from the new construction sector. The National Association of Homebuilders reported that its gauge of home-builder confidence edged lower in November from October, but was still near its highest levels in 2019. Meanwhile, new-home construction climbed 3.8% in October from the previous month, according to the Commerce Department. Residential permits, which can signal the volume of forthcoming construction, also rose in October.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Blackstone Group Inc</span>. has closed the door on its giant rental-home gambit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investment firm late Wednesday sold the last of its stake in <span class="companylink">Invitation Homes Inc</span>., the company it created after the housing crisis to scoop up tens of thousands of foreclosed single-family properties from the courthouse steps, spruce them up and rent them out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> began whittling its position in March[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/blackstone-starts-selling-out-of-home-rental-empire-11559152680] through a series of bulky stock offerings. The last, on Wednesday, was for nearly 11% of Invitation's shares and brought back about $1.7 billion. Including dividends paid before and since Invitation's 2017 initial public offering, <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> reaped about $7 billion in all, according to securities filings. That's better than twice what the firm invested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s wager was that last decade's historic collapse in home prices and advances in cloud computing and mobile technology would enable it to buy enough suburban houses to achieve economies of scale and then to efficiently manage tens of thousands of far-flung rental properties thereafter. To do so would be to tame the final frontier in real estate for institutional investors and gain a toehold in the largest asset class in the world: the U.S. single-family home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The hardest part wasn't buying the homes, it was building the business," Blackstone President Jonathan Gray, who headed the firm's real-estate business when it launched Invitation, said in an interview. "We created a company from scratch. It was created on a yellow pad. It was an idea. Now it's a real business."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the number of foreclosed homes swelled and home prices hit bottom eight years ago, <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> and other big real-estate investors pounced[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/big-landlords-in-talks-to-merge-betting-on-rising-rents-1442808003]. <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>, hotelier Barry Sternlicht and Donald Trump confidante Tom Barrack sent buyers to auctions with duffel bags of cashier's checks and instructions to buy anything that was cheaper than it cost to build new, not too old, big enough for a family and in a good school district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> formed Invitation with a group of Phoenix investors who were buying trailer parks before the crash. They were led by Dallas Tanner, Invitation's 39-year-old chief executive, who at the time was fresh out of graduate school. Starting with a three-bedroom stucco house on the outskirts of Phoenix[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-future-of-housing-rises-in-phoenix-11560957036] that it bought at auction for $100,700, Invitation went on a $10-billion homebuying spree[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/wall-street-as-landlord-blackstone-going-public-with-a-10-billion-bet-on-foreclosed-homes-1481020202].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its buyers streamed into foreclosure auctions across the Sunbelt spending at a clip of more than $100 million a week. In about 18 months, it had bought 30,000 homes one by one and spent another $2 billion or so fixing them up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the flood of foreclosures subsided, the investors hit the open market[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/meet-your-new-landlord-wall-street-1500647417] looking for houses. They employ sophisticated house-hunting algorithms[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/how-to-buy-a-house-the-wall-street-way-1537102800] and increasingly build homes expressly to rent[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/wall-streets-big-landlords-are-so-hungry-for-houses-theyre-building-them-11546511401]. Invitation eventually absorbed the rental empires[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/with-merger-deal-blackstone-starwood-bet-on-being-americas-biggest-home-landlord-1502361000] of Messrs. Sternlicht and Barrack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Invitation's shares received a tepid response[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/invitation-homes-trade-higher-in-market-debut-1485961746] at the onset. Lately, though, they have soared as the company has reported record occupancy and rents[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/rising-home-rents-put-big-landlords-in-sweet-spot-11564747202]. Its shares are up 46% this year despite <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> liquidating its majority stake. Rival <span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span>, which owns about 53,000 homes to Invitation's 82,000, is up 31% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two companies compete at the high end of the rental market. Their typical tenants[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/so-you-make-100-000-it-still-might-not-be-enough-to-buy-a-home-11571149819] aren't quite 40 and have a child or two and a household income of about $100,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The landlords have capitalized on both the willingness of relatively high earners to rent the suburban lifestyle they can no longer afford, and disinterest in homeownership from younger Americans who lack confidence in their employment and the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though homeownership has bounced back from the 50-year lows reached in 2016, it remains well below last decade's rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tanner said that <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s "belief in the validity of our business model and their investments set us on a path to meet an underserved need in the housing market…we look ahead knowing we are well positioned to continue to help families live in great neighborhoods without the cost of homeownership."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short-term vacation rentals haven't significantly contributed to the rise in American housing costs, according to a nationwide study by Oxford Economics that was commissioned by booking website <span class="companylink">Expedia Group</span>. In the first such study to cover every U.S. county where data was available, the report found that over a four-year period only 0.2 percentage point of the 4.3% rise in inflation-adjusted rent could be attributed to the effects of short-term rentals. For home sales, the increase amounts to less than $9 on the average monthly mortgage payment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Lowe's Cos</span>. reported another quarter of soft sales but raised its adjusted full-year earnings targets and said it would trim its store fleet in Canada as part of the home-improvement chain's broader turnaround.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said Wednesday that it is closing 34 Canadian stores early next year as part of its wide-ranging efforts to simplify and improve its business. The company said it also plans to reduce the number of banners it operates under in that country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian restructuring is the latest of President and Chief Executive Marvin Ellison's cost-cutting measures since he took the helm last summer. Mr. Ellison was most recently chief executive of the struggling department-store chain <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney Co</span>. and was previously a senior executive for Home Depot Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past year, Mr. Ellison has closed other underperforming stores and tried to improve the company's supply chain, customer experience and merchandising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest round of closures include 26 Rona stores, six <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> and two <span class="companylink">Reno-Depot</span> locations, the retailer said. The stores are expected to close by Feb. 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company booked a $53 million noncash charge related to the Canadian strategic review in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> reported third-quarter earnings of $1.36 a share, up from 78 cents a share in the year-ago period and more than the $1.34 a share that analysts polled by FactSet had expected. Adjusted earnings were $1.41 a share, ahead of the $1.35 a share analysts were anticipating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales, however, declined 0.2% to $17.39 billion and missed the consensus estimate of $17.69 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mooresville, N.C., company lowered its full-year earnings expectations, but raised them on an adjusted basis, as it anticipates additional charges in the fourth quarter related to the restructuring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> were up 3.9% Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> said sales at stores that have been open for more than 13 months were up 2.2% in the quarter, compared with rival <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>'s same-store sales growth of 3.6%. <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> sales growth in recent years has lagged behind <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, but during the first quarter, <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> sales growth outpaced Home Depot for the first time since 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comparable sales in the U.S. home-improvement business were up 3% in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company attributed the growth in the U.S. to improved customer experience, better merchandise category performance and the continued growth of its business with professionals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is now eyeing how it might expand the professional business further. This quarter it rolled out a loyalty program for its professional customers that it plans to take national in the first half of 2020. The program, with the help of a customer relationship management program, should allow it to be more strategic with its marketing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest quarter, online sales in the U.S. grew 3%, adding no real benefit to sales, Mr. Ellison said, adding that the industry standard is closer to 20% growth. It is in the midst of a major overhaul, including moving its website to the cloud in the first half of 2020, Mr. Ellison said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a call with investors, Mr. Ellison said the company underestimated the complexity of rebuilding its online business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not difficult to grow dot-com sales. It's difficult to do it correctly," he said. "Rather than having a bunch of nonproductive promotions and other couponing events, we shut that down and we basically said, 'How do we structure this business in the right way?' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the complexities of a turnaround, Mr. Ellison said the company this year has faced other uncertainties such as U.S. tariffs on trading partners.</p>

Home Depot Lowers Sales Outlook, Shares Fall; Home-improvement retailer's sales rose 3.5% in latest quarter to $27.22 billion</span>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>.'s third-quarter results fell short of Wall Street expectations, as the expected benefits of an online overhaul are taking longer than planned to materialize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-improvement retailer trimmed its sales forecast for the year and now expects fiscal 2019 sales growth to increase by 1.8%, down from its previous guidance of 2.3%. Same-store sales are projected to grow by about 3.5%, lower than its previous forecast of 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third-quarter sales at the Atlanta company rose 3.5% from a year ago to $27.22 billion, slightly lower than the $27.53 billion Wall Street was expecting, according to FactSet. Sales at stores open at least a year were up 3.6% for the period, below the 4.7% analysts were anticipating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> and its followers were betting in the latest quarter that its investments in technology[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/home-depot-sets-1-2-billion-supply-chain-overhaul-1528739061] to better align its online business with its 2,290 brick-and-mortar stores would have resulted in greater sales gains. The company now says that it is going to take more time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our sales performance was below our expectations," Chief Executive Craig Menear said on a call with analysts. "Our rollout is largely on track and we are realizing benefits, it's just taking a little longer than our original assumptions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of the company were off about 5% to $226.43. The company's stock has rallied more than 30% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance Chief Richard McPhail said in an interview that while the company is taking its time with its re-engineering efforts, overall consumer spending is still healthy. "The consumer is alive and well," he said. "It was one of the most balanced quarters we've had in a long time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of customer transactions during the third quarter was up 1.5% from a year ago, while the amount of money customers spent per visit rose 1.9%. Big-ticket transactions, or the number of comparable transactions over $1,000, climbed 4.8% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower lumber prices continued to weigh on the company in the third quarter, resulting in about $175 million in lost revenue from a year ago, Mr. McPhail said. In August, the company reported weaker than expected second-quarter results[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/home-depot-cuts-sales-forecast-posts-slightly-lower-profit-11566298171?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=4&amp;mod=article_inline] and cut its sales outlook as a result.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The numbers are much stronger than last quarter's rather anemic growth which shows both that <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> is returning to a better trajectory and, most importantly, that the consumer economy is not in a state of distress," said Neil Saunders, a managing director of GlobalData Retail, a research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the company posted net income of $2.77 billion, or $2.53 a share for the period ended Nov. 3, compared with $2.87 billion, or $2.51 a share, a year ago. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting earnings of $2.52 a share.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nancy Keates </div><div>2191 words</div><div>15 November 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the thoroughbreds that whip around the famed track here, real estate moves fast in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, when Zane Carruth and her husband, Brady Carruth, were in for the horse races, they went to an open house for an eight-bedroom, five-bathroom, 5,000-square-foot Victorian mansion on Union Avenue, just a few blocks from the track. The couple, who live in Houston, fell in love with the home's sprawling wraparound porch and decorative trim and put a $2 million offer down the next day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We jumped on it," says Ms. Carruth, 66, a children's book author. "It was too beautiful a house to let it percolate." Sweetening the deal, the Carruths rented out the carriage house in back this past summer for $25,000. Last year, they also sold their three-bedroom, 2,500-square-foot Saratoga Springs penthouse for $1.7 million the day it went on the market. They'd bought it just three years earlier for $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saratoga Springs has been a summer getaway for the elite for over 200 years. Known for its European-style spas and horse races, it is aiming to become more of a year-round destination. The Saratoga Performing Arts Center, which hosts annual residencies with the New York City Ballet and the Philadelphia Orchestra, as well as concerts with artists like the Dave Matthews Band and the Lumineers, is adding more programming this year. The Saratoga Race Course extended its season to eight weeks this year after decades of a six-week season. This might not sound significant, but locals say it represents a big deal in the tradition-bound sport -- a formal nod to the expansion of the high season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate market has responded accordingly. Five new high-end condo projects have gone up in the past four years, with the average price for condos now around $1.1 million, says Kelly Zanella, a local agent with Howard Hanna. Despite the increased supply, home prices grew 29% in September, the latest month available, compared with prices the prior September, according to the Greater Capital Association of Realtors. "The past two years have been incredible," says Gerald Magoolaghan, an agent with <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses within walking distance of downtown Saratoga Springs are in greatest demand, because people want to be able to go out and not worry about driving home, says Aubrey Guri, an agent with Howard Hanna. Most coveted are the historic brick and stone mansions that line North Broadway and Union Avenue. "When they do go on the market, they sell quickly," says Charles Goodridge, associate broker with Keller Williams Capital District.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent purchases include an 1871 Italianate style, 4,300-square-foot, seven-bedroom mansion on Broadway for $2.585 million by an LLC that is managed by newsprint manufacturing executive Peter M. Brant, and three properties, including a four-bedroom, 3,400-square-foot Colonial, purchased by billionaire businessman Vincent Viola for $3 million just down the road. Mr. Viola didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's everyone's dream to land here," says Michele Riggi, 62, who, with her husband Ronald Riggi, owner of a gas-turbine company, built a 25,000-square-foot, five-bedroom, 11-bathroom castle-like home in 2003 on North Broadway for what they estimate was about $18 million to $20 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house, which has domed ceilings in many rooms painted in different themes, floors and walls enrobed in marble and elaborate chandeliers, is the scene of an annual Halloween party open to the town, featuring Ms. Riggi dressed up as Cinderella (a costume she says reflects her life, which had humble beginnings). The couple turned a lot they bought next door in 2010 into a private park and added a heated patio for their 27 small dogs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Riggi says the home's elaborate interior design, modeled after hotels the couple stayed at during trips to Asia and Europe and which includes a Balinese-like spa, is somewhat obsolete ("like a Versace or a Donald Trump house," she says). Still, a real-estate agent called with an offer for the property this summer. The house was not for sale, nor did she and her husband consider the offer, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elizabeth Sobol, 60, didn't expect the town's housing market to be so brisk when she took the job as president of the Saratoga Performing Arts Center. When she and her husband fell in love with a house a friend said might be going on the market, they figured there was no rush. A week later, Ms. Sobol showed up with a deposit check, only to be told the house was sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It never occurred to me someone would swoop in with a full-price offer and an escalation clause in the middle of November," she says. The next time they saw a house they liked, they didn't take any chances: They made a full-price offer for the three-bedroom, 70-year-old Colonial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meghan Russo knew not to wait this past June when someone told her that a house on Saratoga Lake, right across from her own 4,000-square-foot house, might go on the market. Ms. Russo, 42, who lives primarily in Wilton, Conn., offered the full $2.5 million asking price for the 3,800-square-foot, five-bedroom home before it was even listed because she loved the location. (She sold her prior home in October.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Russo says Saratoga Springs has become much more sophisticated than when she was growing up in nearby Mechanicville, N.Y., and spending summers in Saratoga. She says she would move to Saratoga full time, except that her husband works in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ben Adams, 35, doesn't have to make that choice. He works for financial planning firm Ayco, which is owned by <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> and is based in Saratoga Springs. He commutes to see clients in New York and Boston, both about a three-hour trip and doable once a week. Mr. Adams and his wife, India Adams, don't rent out their 4,700-square-foot house in the summer high season -- but most of their friends do, either leaving town to spend a few weeks at the beach or with relatives, or moving into another building on the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rental prices have remained high despite an increase in inventory, due to a year-round rental market that includes students from Skidmore College, visiting parents, golfers, weddings and summer visitors. Prices are as much as $15,000 a week during the racing season, which has attracted more people into the real-estate market, both buying homes and renting their homes out, says Lori Leman of Saratoga Realty Associates. She has started limiting how much new inventory she takes on, and doesn't broker rentals for less than a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Margot Tohn, 55, rents out her six-bedroom, 3,800-square-foot Colonial on 2 acres about 2 miles from the racetrack. She bought it for $390,000 in 2017 and charges $1,500 a night in the summer, a business that brought in about $50,000 in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tohn, an entrepreneurial consultant, lives in Manhattan and wanted a country house she could get to in under three hours that would pay for itself. Renting is a lot of work, she cautions, and includes chores like washing sheets and towels, and sweeping the decks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul and Veronica Fallisi could easily get $1,000 a night for the five-bedroom vacation house they bought for $720,000 three years ago. It is so close to the racetrack they can see the horses from the yard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the couple's daughters, who are in their 20s, are planning to live there now. Plus Mr. Fallisi, a 58-year-old actuarial consultant who lives in Salem, N.H., says he doesn't want to miss a day of summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is like being on vacation all the time," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HISTORY OF A SUMMER HOT SPOT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saratoga Springs earned its name from the mineral springs that gush out of cracks in the earth all around the city. Early American settlers learned of the springs from Native Americans and started opening spas in the 1800s, luring visitors with the promise of baths that cured an array of ailments. Horse racing followed in 1863, after a successful thoroughbred meet sparked the birth of the Saratoga Race Course. The spas and the races propelled the city's reputation as a summer hot spot for wealthy Americans like the Whitneys and Vanderbilts, who built Victorian mansions and hosted presidents, businessmen and celebrities. Tourism and development nosedived in the first half of the 20th century, from the Great Depression through World War II and into the 1950s, but the pace picked up again in the 1960s, when Marylou and Cornelius Vanderbilt "Sonny" Whitney began hosting galas and inviting society friends. The Saratoga Performing Arts Center, which is the summer home of the New York City Ballet and the Philadelphia Orchestra, opened in 1966.</p>

Mr. Adams and his wife India Adams don't rent out their 4,700-square-foot house in the summer high season—but most of their friends do, either leaving town to spend a few weeks at the beach or with relatives, or moving into another building on the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rental prices have remained high despite an increase in inventory, due to a year-round rental market that includes students from Skidmore College, visiting parents, golfers, weddings and summer visitors. Prices are as much as $15,000 a week during the racing season, which has attracted more people into the real-estate market, both buying homes and renting their homes out, says Lori Leman of Saratoga Realty Associates. She has started limiting how much new inventory she takes on, and doesn't broker rentals for less than a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Margot Tohn, 55, rents out her six-bedroom 3,800-square-foot Colonial on 2 acres about 2 miles from the racetrack. She bought it for $390,000 in 2017 and charges $1,500 a night in the summer, a business that brought in about $50,000 in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tohn, an entrepreneurial consultant, lives in Manhattan and wanted a country house she could get to in under three hours that would pay for itself. Renting is a lot of work, she cautions, and includes chores like washing sheets and towels, and sweeping the decks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul and Veronica Fallisi could easily get $1,000 a night for the five-bedroom vacation house they bought for $720,000 three years ago. It is so close to the racetrack they can see the horses from the yard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the couple's daughters, who are in their 20s, are planning to live there now. Plus Mr. Fallisi, a 58-year-old actuarial consultant who lives in Salem, N.H., says he doesn't want to miss a day of summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is like being on vacation all the time," he said.</p>

Apple Commits $2.5 Billion to Fight California Housing Crisis; Tech industry's boom has fueled growth in high-income jobs in Silicon Valley that has rapidly pushed up home prices</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Apple Inc</span>. will commit $2.5 billion toward affordable housing in California[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/housing-in-san-francisco-is-so-expensive-some-people-live-on-boats-11557999002], the latest tech giant to pledge a large sum to help address concerns that Silicon Valley's successes have pushed people out of the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said Monday it would invest $1 billion in an affordable housing investment fund that will help the state develop and build additional low- to moderate-income housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Apple</span> said it would invest another $1 billion to help more first-time home buyers with financing and down-payment assistance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tech company will use $300 million worth of its land to develop affordable housing in San Jose, Calif., it said. An additional $200 million will go toward low-income housing in the Bay Area, <span class="companylink">Apple</span> said. The commitment includes $150 million toward a low-income housing fund and a $50 million donation to the nonprofit Destination: Home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Apple</span>'s announcement follows similar, though smaller, commitments by several other tech titans to address affordable housing. <span class="companylink">Facebook Inc</span>. said last month that it would provide $1 billion[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/facebook-donating-1-billion-toward-affordable-housing-in-silicon-valley-11571760000] to help ease a shortage of such housing in the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, <span class="companylink">Alphabet Inc</span>.'s <span class="companylink">Google</span> made a $1 billion commitment[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/google-makes-housing-commitment-valued-at-1-billion-11560886992?mod=article_inline] to building housing in the San Francisco Bay Area. <span class="companylink">Microsoft Corp</span>. said in January it would spend $500 million on new housing in the Seattle area[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/microsofts-answer-to-seattle-areas-housing-problem-500-million-11547701071?mod=article_inline&amp;mod=article_inline] around its Redmond, Wash., headquarters, a region where the tech boom also has caused shortages of affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tech companies are among the richest in the world. <span class="companylink">Apple</span> and <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> have market capitalizations above $1 trillion, and the iPhone maker last week reported $55.26 billion in net profit for its latest fiscal year. It held more than $200 billion in cash and similar assets at the end of September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tech industry's boom over the past decade has fueled growth in high-income jobs in Silicon Valley and the Seattle area that have rapidly pushed up home prices. That has helped make the areas unaffordable for many middle-class workers, including teachers and emergency responders, and increasingly is impinging on further growth plans for the companies in their home regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median selling price for an existing single-family home in the San Francisco Bay Area in September was $880,000, down year-over-year but still higher than the state median of $605,680 and the national median of $275,100, data from state and national real-estate groups show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The sky-high cost of housing—both for homeowners and renters—is the defining quality-of-life concern for millions of families across this state, one that can only be fixed by building more housing," California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in <span class="companylink">Apple</span>'s news release announcing its $2.5 billion commitment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said its new funding commitments will take about two years and that capital it earns on the investments will be reinvested in future projects over the next five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Before the world knew the name Silicon Valley, and long before we carried technology in our pockets, <span class="companylink">Apple</span> called this region home, and we feel a profound civic responsibility to ensure it remains a vibrant place where people can live, have a family and contribute to the community," Chief Executive Tim Cook said in the news release.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>1142 words</div><div>4 November 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. homeowners are staying in their residences much longer than before, keeping a glut of housing inventory off the market, which helps explain why home sales have been sputtering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners nationwide are remaining in their homes typically 13 years, five years longer than they did in 2010, according to a new analysis by real-estate brokerage Redfin. When owners don't trade up to a larger home for a growing family or downsize when children leave, it plugs up the market for buyers coming behind them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If people aren't moving on, there just are fewer and fewer homes available for new home buyers," said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More homeowners staying put has helped cause housing inventory to dwindle to its lowest level in decades, which has also helped push up prices on homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjusted for population, the inventory of homes for sale is now near the lowest level in 37 years of record-keeping, according to housing-data firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer homes for sale is a big reason why even ultralow mortgage rates, record levels of home equity and a strong job market haven't jump-started the sluggish housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have said aging baby boomers are the biggest culprits because many are staying healthier later in life and choosing not to downsize. Some look around at the lack of smaller, less expensive homes and are loath to get into bidding wars with their children's generation to get one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">States, such as California and Texas, have also implemented tax policies that make it easier for older residents to remain in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barbara O'Mara, a 67-year-old retired accountant, and her husband have lived in their home in Danville, Calif., about a half-hour drive east of Oakland, for 32 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple bought the home for $440,000 in 1987 and it would now be valued at about $1.8 million, she said. If they sold, they would have to pay capital-gains taxes on the windfall and pay much higher property taxes because California limits property tax increases as long as homeowners stay put.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple were without power for four days as the local utility seeks to prevent the spread of wildfires, but Ms. O'Mara said they still have no plans to leave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We would adore a change. We'd like to move to the ocean," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are few young people moving into the neighborhood, she said, "because none of the old people are moving out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the San Francisco metropolitan area, a typical homeowner stays 14 years, up from fewer than 10 years in 2010. Inventory in the same period has plunged more than 46%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Seattle metro has seen a huge influx of new jobs, and housing supply hasn't kept pace. Homeowners there are staying more than three years longer than they did in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of homes for sale in Seattle has declined more than 50% over the last nine years, while home prices have risen more than 80%, according to Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kristen Schriver and her husband found their family of four had outgrown their 1,000-square-foot Seattle home, which she bought for $140,000 a couple of decades ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Schriver, a 53-year-old recruiter, soon realized prices had risen so much that homes no bigger than theirs were selling for $600,000. They couldn't afford to upgrade, so instead they tore their home down and built a new 2,000-square-foot house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You always think this is my little tiny starter home," she said. "Then the market starts changing, outpacing what your income is doing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this isn't just a problem in pricey coastal markets. Homeowners are staying longer in every one of the 55 metros that Redfin studied. Cities where it was once relatively easy to buy a home are seeing owners staying much longer, creating a serious inventory crunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes for sale ticked up last year and in the early part of this year, but in recent months it has dropped back down near the record lows hit in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fall in inventory levels quickly damped hopes that the housing market would rebound in the second half of the year. The pace of existing home sales fell 2.2% in September, the National Association of Realtors reported last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of mobility among homeowners isn't the only reason why supply is tight. Since the recession, home construction hasn't been keeping up with demand due to shortages of labor and land. The share of U.S. homes that are purchased by investors rose to an all-time high of 11% in 2018, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of those investors quickly flip those purchases, but others turn them into single-family rentals and hold on to them for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Houston, homeowners are staying for more than 23 years, up from fewer than 15 years in 2010. Inventory in the same period has fallen 7%. One reason, real-estate agents and economists said, is that the warm local weather means few people leave the area when they retire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shortage of homes is especially acute in the Salt Lake City metropolitan area, where there are nearly 60% fewer homes for sale than there were nine years ago, according to Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents said that home prices in the area have risen so much that it is difficult for longtime residents to afford to move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around Salt Lake City, owners now typically remain in their homes for more than 23 years, or nearly nine years longer than they did in 2010, according to Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shortage of homes has helped drive the median home price up nearly 75% in the same period to about $340,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's really a traffic jam," said Daniel Lopez, a Redfin agent in Salt Lake City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Anjee Barber left San Diego to move to Salt Lake City, she and her partner thought it wouldn't be hard to find a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple spent a year looking before they eventually found a five-bedroom, three-bathroom home with a small yard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the sellers cut the price from $575,000 to $549,000, the couple made an offer and closed last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This isn't any easier than it would be in California," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Robbins, president of the Salt Lake Board of Realtors, said he is working with a couple looking for a house close to downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"On Saturday a new listing pops up and there's 14 showings the first day because everybody is just waiting and waiting and waiting and boom," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Candace Taylor </div><div>3023 words</div><div>1 November 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two decades ago, a $100 million home sale was almost unthinkable. Times have changed: Four homes in the U.S. have closed at or above $100 million this year alone, with at least one more expected to trade by the end of 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The properties that have sold for nine-figure price tags -- and the many more that have sought the landmark sum -- paint a telling portrait of the uber-wealthy in the early 21st century, a time period when massive wealth has come to be increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few. What has emerged are a small number of staggeringly rich buyers who will pay once-unimaginable sums for the home of their choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's gotten so extreme, the wealth of people," said real-estate agent Jeff Hyland of Hilton &amp; Hyland, one of the listing agents of Casa Encantada, a roughly 40,000-square-foot Bel-Air mansion asking $225 million. "People are worth $50 billion -- what do you do with it?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The population of billionaires across the globe hit a record of 2,754 in 2017, with their wealth surging 24% from the prior year, according to a report by data provider Wealth-X. There were 2,170 billionaires world-wide in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accompanying this surge are home sales at never-before-seen prices. Since the first nine-figure sales took place in 2007, roughly 20 homes and ranches across the country have sold for $100 million or more. At least five of those purchasers made their fortunes in tech, including <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s Mark Zuckerberg, who paid about $130 million for roughly 700 beachfront acres in Hawaii with plans to build a home for his family, according to people with knowledge of the deal. Roughly seven of the homes were purchased by buyers in finance, mostly hedge funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some of these elite buyers, one $100 million property isn't enough. In 2012 Ken Griffin, founder of the hedge-fund firm Citadel, paid just under $130 million for an oceanfront compound in Palm Beach, Fla., where he plans to build two homes: one for himself and one for his mother, according to a person with knowledge of his plans. Then earlier this year, he spent about $238 million for a new Manhattan penthouse apartment overlooking Central Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Smith, who made his fortune in liquefied natural gas, has purchased two beach homes on opposite coasts for $110 million each: one on coveted Carbon Beach in Malibu, Calif., and another in the Hamptons, the pricey playground where New York City's elite spend their summers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stanley Kroenke, a real-estate developer who is married to a <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> heiress, paid around $100 million for the Broken O Ranch in Montana in 2012, according to people with knowledge of the transaction. Two years later he paid over $500 million for the massive Waggoner Ranch in Texas, according to people familiar with the deal. Mr. Kroenke has renovated homes on both of the ranches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kroenke is an exception: Almost all nine-figure sales have occurred on the coasts, particularly in California and in New York. This comes at a time when billionaires are increasingly concentrated in a few locations world-wide, with 15 cities accounting for almost 30% of the global billionaire population, according to Wealth X.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the owners didn't respond to requests for comment; some declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York -- which has seen two nine-figure sales to date -- has the highest population of billionaires of any city in the world, the report found. The Los Angeles area, which moved up to seventh place from 11th place the previous year, has seen two nine-figure sales this year, with more uber-wealthy purchasers circling, real-estate agents said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">International buyers, particularly those from the Middle East, are more interested in Los Angeles than in the past, said Mr. Hyland, who predicted that the city will soon see its first $200 million sale. Another factor is the growing presence of technology companies in the area, which has led more tech entrepreneurs to purchase homes even if they don't live there full time, Mr. Hyland said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Pamela Liebman, CEO of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, said uber-wealthy home buyers tend to congregate not just in the same cities, but in the same buildings or neighborhoods, in part as a way to ensure the value of their investment. "Even when you're really wealthy, you don't want to make a mistake," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All three of Los Angeles's nine-figure sales -- including the $100 million sale of the famed Playboy Mansion in 2016 -- happened in the Holmby Hills neighborhood, rather than in the better-known districts of Beverly Hills or Bel-Air. Local agents said that is because Holmby Hills, despite its name, tends to have larger parcels of flat, buildable land than other parts of the hilly city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York City, the $100 million sales have only happened in super-tall, new construction towers in Midtown Manhattan on what is aptly known as "Billionaires' Row." In the Hamptons, nine-figure sales have occurred only on the beachfront in the sought-after village of East Hampton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York and the Hamptons have seen fewer big-ticket deals in recent years, as the area's high-end real-estate market has suffered a slowdown. In Florida, the exclusive barrier island of Palm Beach has seen the state's only sales topping nine figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every home that trades for $100 million or more spawns a bevy of followers who try but fail to achieve a sale at that price point, said New York real-estate appraiser Jonathan Miller. The frenzy of publicity that accompanies each $100 million sale prompts sellers to put nine-figure price tags on their properties -- whether they are warranted or not, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since nine-figure listings first popped up in the mid-2000s, roughly 70 properties have been listed for $100 million or more, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis, plus a number of new development condos available at that price point but not publicly listed. Moreover, many of the properties that fetched more than $100 million were never listed at all, but traded quietly in off-market deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What everybody got wrong about this market is it was never as wide and deep as the press releases said," said Mr. Miller, noting that developers across the country overbuilt super high-end homes to try to lure billionaire buyers. "It's not as big a market as expectations suggested."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while putting a sky-high price tag on a home attracts attention, it can often be a mistake. "If things are overpriced, properties sit and they don't sell," said Los Angeles real-estate agent Kurt Rappaport. "The longer they're on the market, the lower price is going to be."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of these properties have since been taken off the market. In 2012 Steven Klar, the owner of a residential-real-estate development firm, made headlines when he put his 8,000-square-foot penthouse in Manhattan's City-Spire building on the market for $100 million, though nothing in the circa 1987 condo building had sold for anywhere near that price. The property didn't sell; Mr. Klar still owns it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others traded for a fraction of their asking prices. In 2006 Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan listed a 90-acre ranch in Aspen for $135 million. It sold six years later to hedge-fund executive John Paulson for $41 million. And an elaborate Versailles-style mansion in Hillsboro Beach, Fla., once listed for $159 million ultimately sold at auction for $42.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, an elaborate Los Angeles spec house known as the Billionaire sold for roughly $94 million, nearly three years after going on the market for $250 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW BILLIONAIRES BORROW</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers who can afford $100 million homes usually purchase them with cash, agents said. But with interest rates low, buyers often take out a mortgage after the closing so they can use the cash to generate higher returns elsewhere in their portfolio. "They usually take out a loan post-close to put their money back to work," explained ranch broker Tim Murphy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, a buyer might get a mortgage at an interest rate of 2.5%, then use the funds to fetch returns of 10% to 15% somewhere else, said California real-estate agent David Kramer, "as opposed to having $100 million sunk into a house."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these loans aren't your typical 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. Ultra-high-net-worth individuals generally have relationships with financial institutions allowing them to borrow at more favorable terms than the average home buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Usually they work with whoever they have their relationships with," said Robert Cohan, president of the mortgage lender Carlyle Financial. If a client has tens of millions invested with an institution, "to keep the client from going to invest with a different company, they'll subsidize a mortgage rate to make it as attractive as possible."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Guys of this caliber can pretty well dictate what they want and under what terms," Mr. Murphy said. "Banks fall all over themselves when billionaires borrow."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>409 words</div><div>30 October 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three indicators released on Tuesday show the housing market is gaining modest strength in the latter half of the year thanks to lower mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average national home prices grew 3.2% in the year ended in August, according to data released by the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, up slightly from 3.1% the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of Americans who own a home also grew through the summer months. The homeownership rate ticked up to 64.8% in the third quarter, from 64.4% a year earlier, the Commerce Department reported. That matches the highest levels in five years and is within striking distance of its long-run average of 65.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Persistently low mortgage rates have seemingly ended what might have otherwise been a home price race-to-the-bottom this late in our economic expansion," said Ralph McLaughlin, deputy chief economist at CoreLogic Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a weak start to the year, the housing market gained some momentum in the summer, but it is unclear if that will prove sustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of existing home sales accelerated in July and August only to fall back in September, the National Association of Realtors reported last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average rates for a 30-year mortgage stood at 3.75% last week after hitting nearly 5% in November 2018, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. But low mortgage rates aren't boosting the housing market as some economists expected, in part because of a shortage of homes to buy at more affordable price points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A severe and enduring shortage of inventory, particularly at entry-level price points, does continue to impede many would-be buyers' aspirations and is somewhat worrisome," said Matthew Speakman, economist at Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are still growing roughly half as quickly as they were a year ago. The regional picture is also mixed, with more affordable cities continuing to see strong price growth but expensive coastal cities struggling. More than half of the 20 metropolitan areas in the Case-Shiller index reported slower home-price growth in August than in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales, a forward-looking indicator based on purchase contracts signed, indicated that home sales could tick up in the coming months. Pending sales rose 1.5% in September, the second consecutive positive month, the National Association of Realtors said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage market turned red hot over the summer, posting its biggest three months since the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders extended $700 billion of home loans in the July-to-September quarter, the most in 14 years, according to industry research group Inside Mortgage Finance. Mortgage originations for the full year are on pace to hit their highest level since 2006, the peak of the last housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling interest rates spurred homeowners to trade higher-rate mortgages for lower-rate ones to save on monthly payments. Refinancings kept mortgage lenders busy, though home sales haven't recovered as much as economists expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales have risen annually for the past three months, according to the National Association of Realtors, reversing a slowdown that persisted for more than a year. But sales fell about 2% in September from August, indicating the market is struggling to maintain its newfound momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decline in mortgage rates often takes longer to boost home purchases than refinancing because people need to shop for a home first. That could mean a few more months of improving sales as buyers who were drawn back into the market by lower rates continue to close on their purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The last few months have given us glimmers of hope that low rates are inducing existing home sales upwards," said Ralph McLaughlin, deputy chief economist at CoreLogic Inc. "It looks like there is a healthy runway for home sales to tick up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Refinancing activity jumped 75% from a year earlier in July and August, according to data and technology firm <span class="companylink">Black Knight Inc</span>. A record 11.7 million people would have saved at least 0.75 percentage point on their mortgage rate by refinancing in early September, Black Knight said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric O'Sullivan bought a house in January in Old Lyme, Conn., when mortgage rates were in the mid-4% range. But rates have steadily fallen over the course of the year, prompting his mortgage lender to alert him to the potential to lower his rate. He refinanced this month at 3.49%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His house also was appraised for more when he refinanced because he had put substantial work into it. The additional equity allowed him to do away with his mortgage insurance, further lowering his monthly payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I wasn't expecting to be able to refi," Mr. O'Sullivan said. "It didn't even cross my mind."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span>., the nation's largest mortgage lender, said this month that the bank extended $5 billion more in mortgages last quarter than in the quarter before, with refinancings making up a greater share of its originations. They expect the fourth quarter to be at about the same level as the third.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Dutz lowered his interest rate to 3.75% from 4.25% when he refinanced his Colonial-style home in Millstone, N.J., this month. He said he waited about a year for the best rate. "It was all about timing when I wanted to pull the trigger," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good day. This year's two rate cuts by the Federal Reserve appear to be giving a boost to home sales and consumer spending on big-ticket items. And Fed officials, facing weak inflation expectations as well as trade and global economic uncertainty, look set to cut rates a third time this week. Meanwhile, U.S. factories have struggled this year, but the U.S. economy may be big enough and diverse enough to keep expanding even if manufacturing suffers a downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now on to today's news and analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Top News</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing Highlights the Promises—and Limits—of the Fed's ‘Insurance' Rate Cuts</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Federal Reserve officials started cutting interest rates over the summer, they framed the moves as akin to taking out insurance for the economy—steps aimed at providing some support at a time of rising risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The policy makers are likely to approve a third consecutive rate reduction at their meeting this week to provide a bit more protection. They also will consider whether to signal a timeout on additional cuts in part because of the improvements they have seen so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's moves appear to be giving a lift to household spending in areas most responsive to interest rates, such as housing, autos and long-lasting big-ticket items such as appliances. This has helped offset a slump in manufacturing that is due to slowing global growth and business investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Derby's Take: As Fed Meets, Its Inflation Problem Isn't Going Away</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Michael S. Derby</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve is sidling into this week's interest-rate policy meeting no closer to solving its inflation problem, and it may even be getting worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials have failed to achieve their 2% inflation target on a sustainable basis ever since they adopted it in 2012. Twice this year, the Fed has lowered its interest-rate target range to provide insurance against the risks to the economy created by trade uncertainty and a slowing global economy. But a key part of the push for lower rates also has been to help increase prospects that low inflation will rise back to desired levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent signs of weakening inflation expectations don't paint a promising picture on that front. Read More.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Developments Around the World</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed Adds $77.3 Billion in Weekend Liquidity</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">New York Fed</span> injected permanent and temporary liquidity into financial markets Friday. The Fed said Friday it had bought $7.501 billion in Treasury bills to increase its balance sheet, with eligible banks submitting $35.755 billion in short-term government securities to the central bank for purchase. The Fed also added $77.343 billion in liquidity into financial markets Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factory Slump Shows Manufacturing Isn't the Bellwether It Used to Be</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has been a difficult year for American manufacturers, marked by trade war volleys and a global economy running out of steam. Output, investment and employment are down and firms are less optimistic. The overall American economy, however, keeps powering along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. Deficit Hits Seven-Year High</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. spent nearly $1 trillion more in fiscal 2019 than it took in—the highest deficit in seven years that would have been bigger without a rebound in corporate tax revenue. Government deficits have now increased for four years in a row, the longest stretch of U.S. deficit growth since the early 1980s, a period marked by two recessions and a jobless rate near 11%. The budget gap widened 26% in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, to $984 billion from $779 billion deficit the previous year, the Treasury said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, Hong Kong has been one of the world's most profitable banking markets. That status is now under threat. Banks' profit per employee last year was higher in Hong Kong than in any other market tracked by <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> analysts—roughly double the U.S. figure. But now Hong Kong's economy is shrinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Race Is On for the Future of Bond Trading</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street has a new bond king. But as always, there are rivals for the crown, WSJ's Telis Demos writes in a Heard on the Street column. Last week, MarketAxess reported a 30% jump in revenue and 40% jump in net income, both ahead of expectations.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What to Expect When You're Expecting Less Inflation</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Hardly anybody expects much in the way of inflation anymore. That is a big problem for the Federal Reserve," Justin Lahart of the Journal writes. But there is some good news, he adds, with "reason to believe that inflation readings will pick up in the months ahead—especially as some of the idiosyncratic factors that have been pushing the Fed's favored inflation measure lower fade. But for inflation expectations to rise to the point where the Fed isn't worried about them any more, inflation may need to go north of the central banks' 2% target and stay there. The case for that happening is iffy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QE Down Under Would Pack Some Punch</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A bond buying program by the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of Australia</span> in 2020 would pack some punch, and is likely to be much smaller in scale than some have estimated," James Glynn writes for WSJ Pro. "With the RBA's official cash rate cut to a record low of 0.75% at the start of this month, and with a further cut in coming months seemingly locked in, quantitative easing is considered a strong possibility. So, figuring out how QE might play out in a small, open economy like Australia's, and with a limited government bond market to play with, has become critical for markets and policy makers alike."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Justin Owen[https://www.beacontn.org/people/justin-owen], chief executive of the Beacon Center[https://www.beacontn.org/issues/corporate-welfare] of Tennessee, a right-leaning think tank, asked: "Why do we have to talk about the inability to pay our teachers, police and firefighters, yet we're still announcing megadeals with <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> and other companies?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city has committed big dollars to international businesses—including $56 million in long-term incentives[https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2014/12/16/bridgestone-secures-incentives-council-vote/20513847/] to tire maker <span class="companylink">Bridgestone Corp</span>., $62 million to <span class="companylink">Omni Hotels &amp; Resorts</span> and $17.5 million for the <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> towers. But local and state tax structures, including no income tax and property-tax equalization policies that encourage commercial and residential property owners to appeal assessment hikes, make it hard to profit on growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 2010 and early 2017 the city awarded businesses-property tax breaks and other incentives worth more than $167 million, according to The Tennessean'sanalysis of data[https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/investigations/2017/09/17/nashville-growth-jobs-development-tax-incentives/511714001/]from the Mayor's Office of Economic &amp; Community Development. Those companies then promised to add about 13,000 jobs and $1.2 billion in capital investments, the newspaper said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People say, 'With all these cranes in the sky, how did we run out of money?'" Mr. Cooper, a Democrat, told me during a long chat on a rainy afternoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A month into his tenure, he signed a deal with the Music City Center, a city-owned convention hall, to transfer millions of dollars to city coffers to address immediate shortfalls. The longer-term goal is to design incentives that focus on developing Nashville's existing talent base instead of just importing more people. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Music City Center in Nashville, which is providing funding to the city under an agreement reached by Mayor John Cooper. PHOTO: Kristine Potter for The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are an ambitious town, and we want to make the most of our moment," Mr. Cooper, a Nashville native, said. "We've got a generation of economic development narrative here that we are a welcoming, affirming place to move. But you've got to be super careful what you give away, because you're already giving [companies] a major deal in our low tax rate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cooper supports low taxes and his real-estate business has undoubtedly profited from the region's corporate development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mayor said corporate subsidies aren't always designed with the existing population in mind. <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>, for instance, is bringing jobs with an average salary of $150,000—jobs that will create more economic activity but won't necessarily go to Nashville locals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cooper has told <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> "it is important that you be a famous success here. We are not New York." But he's also started dreaming up a better mousetrap for future business attraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His ideal incentive "looks like a human-capital investment where you would say what skill set do you need to come from our workforce and I'll go get certifications for these people," Mr. Cooper said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities, counties, states and the federal government all offer various subsidies to companies looking to move or expand. Nashville offers to waive property taxes for various periods and hand a business $500 for every job created. Those deals are bundled with state incentives that sweeten the pot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Upjohn Institute, a nonprofit research center, estimated that business incentives[https://research.upjohn.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1228&amp;context=reports] cost all levels of <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> $45 billion in 2015, more than triple the 1990 level. Still, the growth of incentives has slowed since the early 2000s as cutbacks are happening in certain parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
That's because skepticism has been rising[https://www.beacontn.org/issues/corporate-welfare]about the need for the inducements. <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>, for instance, earns more profit in a single day than Nashville will pay it over seven years. The Beacon Center's Mr. Owen said these incentives can be "press-release economics"—pleasing to shareholders and beneficial to politicians, but hard to justify to workaday citizens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look no further than Nashville's "cherry-tree moment," as Mr. Cooper called it, to see how the calculus is changing in Nashville.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last spring, city officials planned to cut down 21 historic cherry trees[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2019/04/08/opinion/nfl-nashville-cherry-trees.html] along the Cumberland River to make room for a stage for the <span class="companylink">National Football League</span> to hold its draft. The trees would be turned into mulch for a trailhead. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Gregory, a Nashville-based data scientist and tree conservationist, cried foul. He set up a <span class="companylink">Change.org</span> petition[https://www.change.org/p/mayor-briley-don-t-remove-downtown-nashville-s-cherry-blossom-trees-for-nfl-event?recruiter=540733271&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_abi.pacific_post_sap_share_gmail_abi.gmail_abi&amp;recruited_by_id=ede5f1a0-191b-11e6-929d-0b3ba56ded85&amp;utm_content=fht-14649164-en-us:v2] to protest the plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The zeitgeist of the city was that we have had so many outside forces encroaching on us that the trees represented a final straw," Mr. Gregory said. He estimated that 5% of the city's residents supported the petition, based on data provided by <span class="companylink">Change.org</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials reversed course, with the <span class="companylink">NFL</span> vowing to keep 11 of the trees intact, pay for the relocation of the other 10 and fund the planting of hundreds more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cherry trees may have gone unchopped, but I cannot tell a lie: The incentive game remains vibrant. Many companies still demand tax breaks to seriously consider a region or city.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After nearly three years on the market, America's most expensive home has finally sold—for 62% off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a price tag of $250 million, "Billionaire"—the elaborate Los Angeles spec house built by handbag entrepreneur Bruce Makowsky—was the priciest in the nation when it came on the market in 2017. After several reductions, it has found a buyer for around $94 million, according to people with knowledge of the transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billionaire's variable fortunes reflect the shifting Los Angeles luxury market. One of the most elaborate homes in the country, with a candy room and a crocodile skin-clad elevator, it made its debut at a time when the high-end Los Angeles market was riding high following a couple of record-breaking sales. Listings priced at $100 million or more were the order of the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly three years later, despite a handful of major transactions, prices are facing pressure amid an oversupply of extremely expensive homes. Recently, Formula One heiress Petra Ecclestone sold her Holmby Hills home, known as Spelling Manor for its longtime resident Aaron Spelling, for $120 million, far less than its original $200 million asking price when it went on the market in 2016. That property was purchased by a buyer from Saudi Arabia, according to people familiar with that transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the deals are evidence of demand for high-end real estate in the Los Angeles area, particularly from overseas, the sales have only made a small dent in the glut of properties on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike a lot of spec home builders who rely on hefty loans to build, Mr. Makowsky was in the unique position of being self-financed. He made a fortune selling affordable leather bags on home shopping channel <span class="companylink">QVC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He spared little expense, filling the home with luxurious accessories from designers like Fendi, Roberto Cavalli and <span class="companylink">Louis Vuitton</span>. The roughly 38,000-square-foot home was advertised as being stocked with roughly $30 million worth of cars and motorcycles and over 125 art installations. Driving through Beverly Hills a couple of years ago, Mr. Makowsky spotted a giant camera sculpture in the center of the Leica camera store. It wasn't for sale, but Mr. Makowsky secured the piece for roughly $1 million and displayed it in the main living area of the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located in Bel-Air, the four-level home has 12 bedrooms and 21 bathrooms, three kitchens, five bars, two wine cellars, a four-lane bowling alley, a helipad, a gym, a wellness center, a gaming area and an 85-foot-long infinity pool. A massive movie screen rises up from behind the pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Makowsky bought the site in 2013 for more than $11 million from talk show host Michael Strahan. Mr. Makowsky demolished an existing house to make way for this one, and spent about four years in construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a 2017 interview, he justified the price tag by comparing buying a luxury home to buying a yacht: "To me it doesn't make sense that somebody spends $250 million on a boat where they spend eight weeks a year, but they're living in a $30 or $40 million house," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home is directly adjacent to another spec mansion, which is currently on the market for $180 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Branden Williams and Rayni Williams of the Williams &amp; Williams Estates Group at Hilton &amp; Hyland represented Mr. Makowsky in the deal alongside Shawn Elliott of Nest Seekers International. The buyer, whose identity couldn't be determined, was represented by Ben Bacal of Revel Real Estate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's property developers have used falling U.S. interest rates this year to issue swaths of dollar debt. Yet the state of the country's housing market—now past its prime—suggests investors would do well to steer clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers in Hong Kong and mainland China account for 41% of the net issuance in Asian dollar-denominated bonds included in the ICE Bank of America Merrill Lynch Asian Dollar index this year, rising to 67% in the high-yield segment, where they now make up almost half of the total market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even investors who haven't opted to take direct exposure to the sector may now find it creeping into their portfolios: 14.1% of the same broad Asian Dollar Index is now made up of Chinese and Hong Kong property bonds, up from 11.2% at the end of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two largest contributions come from <span class="companylink">China Evergrande Group</span>, which alone has issued this year around $15 billion in bonds rated by <span class="companylink">Moody's Investors Service</span>, and <span class="companylink">Sunac China Holdings Ltd</span>., which has issued around $6 billion. Sunac was given the lowest relative rating against 14 of its peers based on its financial results during the first half of 2019 by bond researchers at CreditSights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average yields on high-yield Chinese bonds broadly have fallen considerably this year, to around 8.4% from a high of 11.7% as recently as November 2018, according to the ICE Bank of America Merrill Lynch Asian Dollar index. Even <span class="companylink">Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd</span>., which defaulted on dollar bonds in 2015, saw strong demand[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chinese-developer-woos-u-s-investors-with-12-yields-11571227759]for $400 million in issuance last week, at a yield of 12.25%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers have levered up in other ways as well this year: presales of housing, which act as a shadow funding mechanism[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chinese-property-giants-could-regret-milking-the-countrys-middle-class-11568875710]for property companies, have boomed even as completions of housing have been lackluster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is difficult to square with what is actually happening in the housing market. Data released this week showed that house prices in the 70 cities monitored by <span class="companylink">China's National Bureau of Statistics</span> rose by 8.6% in the 12 months to September, the slowest pace in a little over a year. Of those 70 cities, 12 reported price declines, the highest number since February 2018.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those are hardly figures to send investors hiding under their mattresses, but it is difficult to see how the sector would return to more frenetic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central government's reticence to pursue a broader stimulus this year has been based in no small part on a reluctance to allow credit to flood the housing market, as it did after the wave of 2016 stimulus, when household debt growth doubled.[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-trouble-with-rate-cuts-in-china-11566385540]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several cities have undertaken more restrictive real estate policies in recent months, including limits on nonresident purchases, price caps and preventing developers from converting commercial to residential land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The case for Chinese property debt at their current prices is feeble enough, even before considering that foreign investors are at the bottom of the pile as far as the Chinese government's priorities go.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market sputtered in September as a lack of homes for sale and high prices disrupted what was shaping up as a rebound in the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned U.S. homes fell 2.2% in September from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.38 million, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales rose for two straight months in July and August, offering hope that a year-long slowdown in the market was turning around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying conditions had turned more hospitable in recent months, thanks to falling mortgage rates, a growing selection of homes for sale and slowing home-price growth.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of previously owned U.S. homes declined in September, a sign that high prices and slim inventory continue to weigh on the housing sector despite low interest rates, strong employment and firmer wage growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales fell 2.2% in September [https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/existing-home-sales-decrease-2-2-in-september] from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.38 million, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected sales declined 0.7% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market is in an unbalanced situation" with soaring prices and persistent low inventory, said Lawrence Yun, the trade group's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with a year earlier, sales in September rose 3.9%. Purchases of previously owned homes account for the bulk of U.S. home-buying. August's sales were revised up slightly to a 5.50 million pace from an earlier estimate of a 5.49 annual pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market's weakness has come despite many favorable conditions for potential buyers. Mortgage rates have been dropping steadily in recent months. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at the end of September was 3.64%, down from about 4% six months earlier, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, a shortage of homes for sale in some areas means home prices remain high. The median sale price for an existing home in September was $272,100, up 5.9% from a year earlier. That marked 91 straight months of year-over-year price gains and the strongest pace of appreciation since January 2018. There was a 4.1 month-supply of homes on the market at the end of September, based on the current sales pace.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market sputtered in September as a lack of homes for sale and high prices disrupted what was shaping up as a rebound in the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned U.S. homes fell 2.2% in September[https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/existing-home-sales-decrease-2-2-in-september] from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.38 million, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have you recently bought or sold a home? What has been your experience in the market recently? Join the conversation below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales rose for two straight months in July and August, offering hope that a year-long slowdown in the market was turning around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying conditions had turned more hospitable in recent months, thanks to falling mortgage rates, a growing selection of homes for sale and slowing home-price growth. But the latter two factors have quickly reversed course and dampened home buyer enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can sit there and go, 'Oh my god, look how low mortgage rates are.'" said Tom Lawler, founder of Lawler Economic and Housing Consulting. "But then you go, 'Look how high home prices are."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price for an existing home in September was $272,100, up 5.9% from a year earlier, the strongest pace of appreciation since January 2018.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates have been steadily dropping throughout much of this year, helping to make buying a home more affordable. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at the end of September was 3.64%, down from about 4% six months earlier, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boost from lower mortgage rates may take months to be felt in the housing market, since it takes buyers a while to find and then close on a home. Many economists predict the market will improve slightly through the end of the year. Sales in September were up 3.9% compared to a year ago, the third straight month of annual growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yvette Evans, a Redfin agent in Austin, said buyers have been slow to come back into the market since rates dropped earlier this year, but she has seen an uptick in activity in the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she said current owners are reluctant to sell their homes because prices have risen so much they may not be able to afford a substantial upgrade. Buyers are also put off by the shortage of inventory in many desirable neighborhoods, which means they end up losing repeated bidding wars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People get emotionally burned out from not winning, so people say I'm just going to renew my lease and sit tight," Ms. Evens said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She also added, "With interest rates dipping down people were refinancing instead of moving."</p>

U.S. unemployment dropped to a half-century low[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-september-nonfarm-payrolls-grew-steadily-11570192288] in September and wage growth has been solid, but weakness in manufacturing at home and abroad[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/global-trade-set-for-weakest-year-since-crisis-11569924455] have stoked fears of a broader slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists will be watching the housing market closely in the coming months because it could help buffet the economy against those concerns.

Facebook Commits $1 Billion Toward Affordable Housing in Silicon Valley; The social-media giant estimates its initiative will produce up to 20,000 new housing units over the next decade</span>
</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>1108 words</div><div>22 October 2019</div><div>12:30</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Facebook Inc</span>. said it is providing $1 billion to help ease a shortage of affordable housing in Silicon Valley, the third tech giant this year to commit to addressing the issue as the industry seeks to soften the impact of its rapid growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The social network company estimates its initiative will produce up to 20,000 new housing units over the next decade, much of it aimed at teachers, police and other middle-class workers near its headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, tech giants have pledged record amounts to address the need for affordable housing in West Coast cities. In June, <span class="companylink">Alphabet Inc</span>.'s <span class="companylink">Google</span> made a $1 billion commitment[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/google-makes-housing-commitment-valued-at-1-billion-11560886992] to building housing in the San Francisco Bay Area. <span class="companylink">Microsoft Corp</span>. said in January it would spend $500 million on new housing[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/microsofts-answer-to-seattle-areas-housing-problem-500-million-11547701071?mod=article_inline] in the Seattle area around its Redmond, Wash., headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State and local regulations that have limited new development, combined with an influx of highly paid technology workers, have pushed up the cost of housing in California beyond what most middle-class workers can afford. The conditions have led <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> to cut back on its growth in Menlo Park and San Francisco, Mark Zuckerberg told employees earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At this point, we're growing primarily outside of the Bay Area," he said. "The housing prices are way up. The traffic is bad. There's a lot that we are trying to do to help build more housing and alleviate some of the traffic constraints, but for the near term it's going to be building up those other hubs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing advocates have welcomed the commitments by technology companies but say they will barely make a dent in the housing crisis, which is a growing problem throughout the state. California is short 3.4 million housing units, according to a study by consulting firm ECONorthwest and Up for Growth, an advocacy group for loosening building regulations. The figure is based on population and job growth trends from 2000 to 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should tech companies in the Bay Area be taking more responsibility in addressing the housing crisis in the area? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Facebook</span> will distribute the money through a variety of channels, including giving it to local nonprofits and community development financial institutions, which will in turn provide low-cost funding for developers. The funding will help take the place of scarce public subsidies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said the housing produced will serve a variety of income levels, from the recently homeless to residents who make too much to qualify for traditional low-income housing but still struggle to afford Bay Area housing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About $250 million of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s donation will go to a partnership between the company and the California governor's office, which will provide underutilized state-owned land to developers at virtually no cost. In turn, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> will subsidize the construction of new units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Facebook</span> said its plan should allow middle-income housing to be built on these properties without additional public subsidy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need others to join <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> in stepping up," said California Gov. Gavin Newsom. "Progress requires partnership with the private sector and philanthropy to change the status quo and address the cost crisis our state is facing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The perception that tech companies are driving up home prices and forcing out middle-class families creates challenges when the companies need local approval to add more office space. Advocates argue that allowing companies to add more workers will exacerbate displacement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's important that [tech companies] are acknowledging their impact on rising rents and displacement in Silicon Valley, but it's really going to take a lot to make the scale of investment to make sure they're not impacting working families," said Jeffrey Buchanan, director of public policy at Working Partnerships USA, a nonprofit that advocates for low-income residents in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Facebook</span> is currently seeking approval for a new complex for about 6,000 employees that is slated to include roughly 1,700 units of mixed-income units. The billion-dollar figure includes the $225 million value of the land on which that housing will be built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is also under increasing scrutiny in Washington, D.C., including on housing issues. Mr. Zuckerberg is set to testify[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/facebooks-zuckerberg-to-face-congressional-grilling-11571755928] on Wednesday before the <span class="companylink">U.S. House Financial Services Committee</span> about allegations that <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> allowed third-party advertisers to exclude certain users from seeing ads for available housing, a potential violation of the Fair Housing Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Mateo County, where <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s headquarters are located, added more than 13 jobs for every new housing unit created from 2010 through 2015, according to Up for Growth. That is far from what economists say is a healthy ratio of one unit of housing for every 1.5 to 2 jobs that are created.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growth of technology companies is by no means solely responsible for the problem. State environmental regulation and restrictive local zoning have stymied development throughout California. Menka Sethi, Facebook's director of location strategy, said the company will also need to push for looser building regulations to have the impact it desires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Funding alone cannot solve this. We can fund away, but if the housing doesn't get approved we're stuck," Ms. Sethi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of its new initiative, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> will also contribute $150 million to a fund that builds housing for low-income residents and the homeless run by the Partnership for the Bay's Future. The fund launched earlier this year with support from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to provide housing for up to 175,000 households in the area over the next five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tech company will spend another $25 million to build housing for teachers and other workers in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties. Ms. Sethi said a local principal has complained that the housing crisis had become so bad that students were facing rotating substitutes because teachers couldn't afford to live in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the funds could also be spent in other cities where the company has offices, though the company hasn't decided where.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were beginning to feel very viscerally and hearing from our local community members that the jobs just kept growing and the ability to scale housing production wasn't keeping pace," Ms. Sethi said.</p>

</div><div>WSJ Staff</div>
<div>457 words</div><div>20 October 2019</div><div>21:51</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the week ahead, data on U.S. durable-goods orders, along with eurozone figures on activity at factories and service providers, will be watched for signs of a further slowdown in manufacturing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors releases figures on existing-home sales. Americans bought more previously owned homes in August than in July. Sales rose 1.3%, the strongest gain since March of last year. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect sales pulled back in September and posted a 0.2% decline. This week's report, in addition to figures on September new-home sales from the Commerce Department on Thursday, will offer fresh insight into how home buyers are responding to competing forces: While mortgage rates are historically low, the housing sector has been constrained in part by low inventory of affordably priced homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department issues figures on September durable-goods orders. Economists expect orders for durable goods—manufactured products intended to last at least three years—fell 0.8% in September[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-manufacturing-production-declined-in-september-11571318254]from a month earlier. In August, sales rose 0.2%, marking the third straight month of gains. The durable-goods figures will follow recent U.S. industrial production data that added to evidence of a global manufacturing slowdown. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> reported on Thursday that manufacturing output, the biggest component of industrial production, fell 0.5% in September from a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surveys of purchasing managers in the eurozone are also due out Thursday. They are expected to show a stabilization of business activity in October, albeit at a very weak level. Economists expect the composite Purchasing Managers Index—an aggregate measure of manufacturing and services activity—to rise to 50.3 from 50.1 in September, barely above the 50.00 level that separates expansion from contraction. The surveys will be released as officials from the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> begin the final session of their policy meeting. They are expected to leave the central bank's key interest rate unchanged at minus 0.5%, having lowered it in September and restarted a paused program of bond purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span> will issue final results of its October consumer sentiment survey. Preliminary results showed U.S. consumers were feeling more positive in early October, but were still cautious. Consumer spending has helped drive the U.S. economy this year, but recent data have suggested Americans may be pulling back on shopping[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-retail-sales-fell-in-september-11571229234]. Retail sales—a measure of purchases at stores, at restaurants and online—decreased a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in September from a month earlier, the first monthly decline since February.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anna Isaac and Caitlin Ostroff </div><div>737 words</div><div>11 October 2019</div><div>17:40</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of optimism that the U.K. could reach a divorce deal with the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> drove the pound and stocks of U.K. banks and home builders sharply higher Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sterling climbed 1.6% against the U.S. dollar on talk of a breakthrough between the two sides after months of worsening relations, causing investors to review their bets on the currency losing further value. The currency posted its biggest-two day gain since December 2008, having climbed 3.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares in U.K. banks and home builders soared more than 10% on hopes a deal could avert further weakening in the British economy. Domestically focused <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC</span>, <span class="companylink">Lloyds Banking Group PLC</span> and <span class="companylink">CYBG PLC</span> are seen as bellwethers for the economy and have moved in tandem with sterling this year as a potential deal slipped in and out of view. Home builders Persimmon PLC and <span class="companylink">Taylor-Wimpey PLC</span>, as well as construction-materials firm <span class="companylink">Travis Perkins</span>, also rallied hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors attributed the sharp rise to remarks from European Council President Donald Tusk[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/prospect-of-brexit-deal-bolstered-after-irish-u-k-talks-says-top-eu-official-11570788745] that he sees, for the first time, "a pathway to a deal." That followed a meeting Thursday between U.K. Prime Minister Johnson and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, where the two discussed how to unblock Brexit negotiations following a diplomatic impasse over avoiding a hard border appearing on the island of Ireland after Brexit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's obvious that something in that meeting unlocked the situation," said Derek Halpenny, head of global markets research for Europe at <span class="companylink">MUFG Bank</span>. "Something meaningful" had clearly been accomplished in that meeting, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are still hurdles to be overcome in the Brexit process for a deal to be sealed before the Oct. 31 deadline, analysts said, even as diplomats and other officials said talks would step up over the weekend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Brexit deal is now more likely to be passed by Parliament because key euroskeptic lawmakers believe Mr. Johnson will pursue a looser long-term relationship with the <span class="companylink">EU</span> than his predecessor Theresa May, said Jordan Rochester, currency strategist at <span class="companylink">Nomura Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the pound climbed on the signs of a breakthrough, it is unlikely to return to the strength seen before 2016's <span class="companylink">EU</span> referendum. The currency has fallen close to 15% against the dollar since the vote, and the greenback has gained in strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Looking at the longer-term picture, we are still very much in the range for sterling that we've been in for the three-year period," said John Wraith, head of U.K. rates strategy at <span class="companylink">UBS Group AG</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">UBS</span> expects the pound to remain in a range from $1.05 to $1.50 in scenarios ranging from a hard Brexit to a new referendum in which the U.K. remains in the <span class="companylink">EU</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most likely is this, what we're calling the middle ground, where we sort of limp around with one extension after the other, or we then get a deal that sees the U.K. go into transition," Mr. Wraith said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">UBS</span> recommends that clients stay light on risk for the pound and buy put options, a type of insurance against sudden price moves, for the euro against the dollar, as the bank expects that currency pair to react to future Brexit headwinds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the banks, <span class="companylink">Barclays PLC</span>, which also has a large U.S. credit cards business and investment bank, rose 6.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The banking stocks have also been whipped around in recent weeks as investors fretted about how they might fare under a Labour government— if Mr. Johnson doesn't reach a deal and the opposition party were to win a general election. Lloyds, <span class="companylink">RBS</span> and CYBG are all still around 10% lower than in April, when an agreed delay to the planned exit from the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> eased fears at the time of a no-deal Brexit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
John Cronin, a banks analyst at <span class="companylink">Goodbody Stockbrokers</span>, said there was still "massive value" in banks after previous selloffs, "if you share my view that a compromise will be reached."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The California Apartment Association took a neutral position with the rent-cap law after Gov. Gavin Newsom negotiated key amendments to the bill with the group in August. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the association supported the new law. Also, an earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to the National Association of Realtors as the National Realtors Association. (Oct. 17, 2019)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California will cap rent increases under a new law signed Tuesday by Gov. Gavin Newsom, the most significant piece of housing-related legislation in a year that also saw the shelving of a measure to relax zoning and spur more construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Democratic governor has said the rent caps and tenant protections are necessary to help people being squeezed out of their homes. The law limits annual rent increases at 5%, plus the rate of inflation, and adds some barriers for landlords seeking to evict people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before signing the measure at a ceremony in Oakland, Calif., Mr. Newsom said the law wouldn't be enough to contain the state's housing woes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have to address the issue of production in the state of California," Mr. Newsom said. "We need to build more damn housing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocates said the California legislature fell short of taking the action needed to seriously address the state's rising housing costs and homelessness[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/homelessness-grows-in-california-despite-new-government-spending-11559899801].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Rent caps don't solve the housing crisis,'" said Matthew Lewis, a spokesman for California YIMBY, which advocates for more housing and co-wrote high-profile statewide rezoning legislation known as Senate Bill 50 that was back-burnered until next year. "The root of the problem is a shortage of housing, and it is a severe, long-term shortage."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SB 50 died this session after some cities vehemently opposed it, arguing the bill eroded local control. The bill's backers said that without major zoning changes, California won't be able to build the housing it needs to match its population growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We didn't see the kinds of game-changing policies out of this legislative session that are going to be necessary to significantly address the housing crisis," said David A. Garcia, policy director for the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the <span class="companylink">University of California, Berkeley</span>. which researches housing policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than half of California renters are considered burdened, paying more than 30% of income for housing, including utilities, according to estimates by the Joint Center for Housing Studies of <span class="companylink">Harvard University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The statewide median home price hit a record high of $617,410 in August, according to the <span class="companylink">California Association of Realtors</span>, reaching $627,690 in Los Angeles County and $1.6 million in San Francisco.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With 129,972 people homeless in 2018, California is ranked No. 1 in the U.S., according to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During his campaign for governor, Mr. Newsom said he wanted to build 3.5 million units of housing in the state by 2025, an unheard-of pace in recent years. So far in 2019, California is on course to build 120,302 new housing units, a 2% increase from the previous year, according to the <span class="companylink">California Building Industry Association</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rent-cap law faced opposition from groups including the National Association of Realtors, which said the measure discourages new rental housing.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is a bit better lately. But considering the overall economic environment, the improvement still counts as underwhelming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, the National Association of Realtors reported that its index of pending home sales -- sales of previously owned homes that are under contract but haven't been finalized -- bounced back in August, putting it 2.5% above its year-earlier level. That follows Wednesday's Commerce Department report showing that new-home sales jumped last month and last week's report that existing-home sales firmed in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest factor behind the pickup in housing has probably been the decline in interest rates. Earlier this month, the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage slipped to 3.49%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That compared with 4.54% a year earlier. It was the lowest rate since 2016 and one of the lowest in history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the job market continues to do well, with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low and wages picking up. Home-price gains have moderated over the past year and are now rising more slowly than per capita after-tax income, helping affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as welcome as the pickup has been, it must be kept in perspective. Combined new- and existing-home sales have gotten back only to where they were in the beginning of last year. And they are about level with where they were in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing could show some further improvement in the months ahead, of course. Still, that such an apparently benign environment isn't driving significantly higher sales shows what stiff headwinds the sector faces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the financial crisis, more Americans question the value of owning a home, while the 2017 tax cuts reduced the financial incentives for homeownership, especially in high-tax states. Many millennials are saddled with high levels of student debt, making the prospect of taking on additional debt to buy a home worrisome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So for now, housing looks as if it is going to provide only modest support for the economy. For it to really take off, it seems like the environment would somehow have to become even more benign, with mortgage rates slipping to new historic lows while the job market continues to run strong. That seems like an unlikely combination.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home price growth is continuing to lose momentum, a boon to buyers who are also benefiting from falling mortgage rates and a trend that could help sustain the recent pickup in home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average national home prices grew 3.2% in the year ending in July, according to the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index [https://us.spindices.com/documents/indexnews/announcements/20190924-1000959/1000959_cshomeprice-release-0924.pdf?force_download=true], unchanged from the prior month. The gain in the 20-city index slowed to 2% from 2.2% the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected the 20-city index to gain 2.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Year-over-year home prices continued to gain, but at ever more modest rates," said Philip Murphy, Managing Director and Global Head of Index Governance at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time as price growth is slowing, 30-year mortgage rates have fallen to less than 4% from nearly 5% in November. That could be good news for would-be buyers, who had been struggling to find homes in their price range in a hot market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Improving affordability could help propel a continued pickup in home sales through the fall. Sales of previously owned homes [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-rose-in-august-11568901750?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=1] rose 1.3% in August to their strongest pace in nearly a year-and-a-half, the National Association of Realtors said last week. Home building [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-housing-starts-rose-strongly-in-august-11568811166?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=6] meanwhile rose to its highest level since June 2007, according to Commerce Department data released last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been slowing for more than a year, as buyers in many cities appear to have reached a limit and are choosing to stay renting or renovate their current homes. But there are signs that may be started to reverse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Annual home price growth continued to cool in July, but more-recent data suggest the market may have begun to turn over the summer, showing modest acceleration in growth compared to earlier in the year," Matthew Speakman, economist for Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another measure of home price growth, the Federal Housing Finance Agency House Price Index [https://www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/Pages/FHFA-House-Price-Index-Up-0pt4-Percent-in-July-Up-5pt0-Percent-From-Last-Year.aspx], picked up a bit of speed in July. It showed home prices growing 0.4% from the previous month, up from a 0.2% increase in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller data offers signs that markets on the West Coast, which have been slowing sharply, are starting to stabilize. Prices in Seattle fell 0.06% in July, an improvement from a 1.3% drop in June. That suggests the Seattle market is heading for a slowdown but not a crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price growth remains strongest in some of the more affordable markets in the country. Phoenix led the country for price growth with a 5.8% annual increase, followed by Las Vegas at 4.7% and Charlotte, N.C., at 4.6%.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the week ahead, the <span class="companylink">U.S. Commerce Department</span> releases fresh figures on new-home sales, durable goods and household spending. The eurozone issues figures on activity at factories and service providers, and China releases data on industrial profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday: The eurozone publishes manufacturing and services survey data. The figures are expected to point to steady growth in activity during September, while indicating the services sector weakened even as the decline in manufacturing activity slowed. Economists expect the composite purchasing managers index—which aggregates measures of activity for factories and service providers—to rise to 52.0 from 51.9 in August, pointing to a continued expansion, albeit at a modest pace. However, they expect the services measure to fall to 53.3 from 53.5, while the manufacturing index is seen edging up to 47.2 from 47.0. A reading below 50.0 points to a decline in activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday: The Commerce Department releases figures on new-home sales for August. Americans bought fewer newly built homes in July than during the previous month, despite a decline in mortgage rates. Economists expect a 3.8% increase in this week's report, which will shed light on whether lower rates are enticing more buyers and how concerns over limited housing inventory are playing out in the market for new homes. The housing market overall has been showing modest signs of a pickup, after underperforming the broader economy for more than a year. U.S. housing starts and existing home sales saw strong gains in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday: The Commerce Department issues figures on August durable-goods orders and household spending. Economists expect orders for durable goods—manufactured products intended to last at least three years—decreased by 1.2% in August from a month earlier. In July, orders rose 2.0%. The latest durable-goods data come as other recent figures have indicated a global manufacturing slowdown. In August, a key measure of U.S. factory activity contracted for the first time in three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists estimate U.S. household spending increased 0.3% during August, which would represent continued strength in consumer activity, while other segments of the economy—namely business investment and manufacturing—have been slowing. In July, household spending rose by 0.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China releases data on profits at large industrial firms. Economists expect industrial earnings growth to remain sluggish, a major policy concern. Upstream players are struggling with falling prices due to soft demand, although consumer-goods producers are benefiting from rising food prices. If companies aren't making money, they will not only cut down on investment and production, but they will probably also cut wages. That is something Beijing doesn't want to see.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Will Parker and David Harrison </div><div>582 words</div><div>20 September 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">August was the strongest month for sales of U.S. homes in nearly a year and a half, sparking fresh hope that a protracted slump in the housing market may finally be starting to reverse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned U.S. homes rose 1.3% in August from July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49 million, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected sales to fall 1.1% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The August gain, which came after July marked the first year-over-year uptick in 17 months, strengthened the case that some of the lowest mortgage rates of the past 50 years may at last be luring more buyers back into the market, economists said. For months, they have grappled with why ultralow borrowing rates, strong employment and rising wages have failed to spark more home buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Just perhaps we may have turned a corner for good in terms of home sales, which had been underperforming in relation to jobs, mortgage rates and other factors," said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Annually, sales in August were up 2.6%, the second month of growth following 16 straight months of declines. Purchases of previously owned homes account for most of U.S. home buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average fixed mortgage rates for 30-year loans were 3.73% in the latest week, down from close to 5% in November, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Mortgage applications for home purchases have risen for three straight weeks, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>, and housing starts were up more than 12% in August. That marked the biggest monthly gain for new-home construction since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Significant headwinds remain. For one, the price of homes available for sale continues to rise. The median sales price in August was $278,200, up 4.7% from a year ago, marking the 90th consecutive month of price increases on an annual basis. The number of homes available for sale, meanwhile, fell in August. The shortage also has been propping up prices, Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given the other constraints that buyers face -- tight inventory and strained affordability -- their enthusiasm for low rates is bound to be muffled, which explains why August existing sales gained only modestly," said Matthew Speakman, economist at Zillow. "Even stronger sales volumes may be around the corner given that mortgage rates plummeted in August."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerns that the U.S. economy might be headed for a recession and uncertainty about how trade disputes with China will affect the economy also are deterring some buyers, economists and real-estate agents have said for several months now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet for those who can afford it, risings rents that continue to break price records nationwide are starting to nudge some renters to consider homeownership more seriously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in Southern states increased 3.6% on the year ended in August, making it the region with the largest annual growth in sales volume. Prices there rose 5.4% over the same period. In the West, where sales prices are highest, the number of sales rose 1.8% over the past year and the median home price rose 5.7% to $415,900.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Adrienne Gaffney </div><div>438 words</div><div>20 September 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mountain living offers unbeatable ski access, spectacular vistas and, particularly in the major markets of Aspen, Colo., Park City, Utah, and Ketchum, Idaho, sky-high price tags. Being a skip, hop and a jump from the slopes brings with it a significant price premium and a real-estate market that has its own rhythms and practicalities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers should make sure they're aware of what the area is like in all seasons, and that they're prepared to deal with the level of snow they might be regularly getting. Many are looking for a home for ski vacations but come to find they love the summer months as well. "It's always good to consider what is a property like in different seasons. If you're just looking in the winter, think about what is this property going to be like in the summer," says Aspen real-estate agent Carrie Wells. Mrs. Wells says that even though Aspen is a ski area, she's recently noticed more sales happening in the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents see many factors that account for the high prices in locales like Aspen, which has only around 7,000 full-time residents, and Sun Valley, Idaho, where the remote location makes commuting in more difficult. "Most of these resorts are smaller resorts and so you don't have a stable labor force. You've got a labor force, but it is limited. Obviously, construction costs are going to be higher in a smaller area than they are in a major city where you've got lots of competition and lots of workers available," says Suzanne Williams, owner of Sun Valley Real Estate/<span class="companylink">Christie's International</span> Real Estate. Mrs. Williams sees higher prices per foot in a place like Sun Valley, where the population was 1,473 as of 2018, than popular ski destinations like Jackson, Wyo., which has a much larger supply of workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Land-use regulations limit new development and growth, and a limited supply drives up prices. They also shape the look and character of the town. "It makes for a beautiful area, because we do have height restrictions and limited growth, but that means what is developed becomes more rare and pricey," Mrs. Wells says.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building in the U.S. increased in August to the highest level since June 2007, according to Commerce Department data released Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report cues a positive note for the American housing industry in what has been a year marked by lagging home sales and sluggish single-family construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts, a measure of new-home construction, climbed 12.3% in August from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.364 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The new-home market is getting a boost this year from lower mortgage rates and the extremely low levels of supply for existing homes." said Ben Ayres, senior economist at Nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast that starts rose 4.1% to an annual pace of 1.24 million last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the August jump in housing starts, the market is playing catch-up, said National <span class="companylink">Association of Home Builders</span> economist Robert Dietz, because single-family housing starts on the year-to-date are still down 2.7%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, it was strength in the multifamily sector that helped drive the steep August climb in building. Construction of buildings with two or more units rose 32.8% in August from a month earlier. Single-family home construction, meanwhile, rose just 4.4%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential building permits, which can signal how much construction is in the pipeline, rose 7.7% from July to an annual pace of 1.419 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-starts data are volatile from month to month and can be subject to large revisions. August's 12.3% increase for starts came with a margin of error of 10.2 percentage points. More broadly, home construction has been weak this year. In the first eight months of 2019, starts were down 1.8% compared with the same period in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's data are a positive sign for a housing sector that has been on shaky footing the past year. Despite historically low mortgage rates and rising wages, the housing sector has been strained by a low inventory of affordable homes, propelled by rising construction costs and lack of land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the Commerce Department reported that July saw the largest monthly drop in new-homes sales since 2013, with new-home sales falling by 12.8 percent, a bigger decline than economists had anticipated. Numbers for August 2019 will be released on Sept. 25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have been waiting for low mortgage rates to have a measurable impact on the housing market. The average interest rate on a 30-year mortgage was 3.56% last week, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, about a percentage point less than it was a year ago. A Wednesday report from the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> showed that mortgage applications for home purchases have risen for three straight weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-builder stocks, meanwhile, are outpacing the S&amp;P 500[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/home-builder-stocks-jump-as-mortgage-rates-slide-11568747621]this year by a 13-point margin, fueled in part by speculation over low borrowing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow economist Matthew Speakman said the strong August housing-starts numbers indicated high builder confidence was being buoyed by falling mortgage rates. "It's not flashy, but this sign of resilience is welcome news for a housing market that is still struggling to grasp some momentum," Mr. Speakman said.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Mountain Homes With Steep Slopes and Price Tags, Too; Markets like Aspen, Park City and Ketchum, Idaho offer homes with easy access to ski slopes and stunning mountain views. But it'll cost you</span>
</div><div class="author">By Adrienne Gaffney </div><div>543 words</div><div>17 September 2019</div><div>14:55</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mountain living offers unbeatable ski access, spectacular vistas and, particularly in the major markets of Aspen, Park City and Ketchum, Idaho, sky-high price tags. Being a skip, hop and a jump from the slopes brings with it a significant price premium and a real-estate market that has its own rhythms and practicalities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers should make sure they're aware of what the area is like in all seasons, and that they're prepared to deal with the level of snow they might be regularly getting. Many are looking for a home for ski vacations but come to find they love the summer months as well. "It's always good to consider what is a property like in different seasons. If you're just looking in the winter, think about what is this property going to be like in the summer," says Aspen real-estate agent Carrie Wells. Mrs. Wells says that despite Aspen being a ski area, she's recently noticed more sales happening in the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents see many factors that account for the high prices in locales like Aspen, which has only around 7,000 full-time residents, and Sun Valley, Idaho, where the remote location makes commuting in more difficult. "Most of these resorts are smaller resorts and so you don't have a stable labor force. You've got a labor force, but it is limited. Obviously, construction costs are going to be higher in a smaller area than they are in a major city where you've got lots of competition and lots of workers available," says Suzanne Williams, owner of Sun Valley Real Estate/<span class="companylink">Christie's International</span> Real Estate. Mrs. Williams sees higher prices per foot in a place like Sun Valley, where the population was 1,473 as of 2018, than popular ski destinations like Jackson, Wyo., which has a much larger supply of workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Land use regulations limit new development and growth, and a limited supply drives up prices. They also shape the look and character of the town. "It makes for a beautiful area, because we do have height restrictions and limited growth, but that means what is developed becomes more rare and pricey," Mrs. Wells says. "Unlike other resort areas where they don't have land use codes in place or they don't have limited growth, it has a different character. It looks different."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dorset, Vt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This home in Dorset, Vt., has views of the Green Mountain National Forest. It is seeking $2.995 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ketchum, Idaho</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This Ketchum, Idaho, home, which faces Bald Mountain, is asking $5.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jackson, Wyo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This home in Jackson, Wyo., asking $4.495 million, looks directly at the Grand Teton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Park City, Utah</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This home in Park City, Utah, takes in views of the Deer Valley Ski Resort and the Park City Mountain Resort. It is asking $2.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Waynesville, N.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This property in Waynesville, N.C., overlooks Waterrock Knob in the Plott Balsams Mountain Chain. It is asking $3.999 million.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Economy Week Ahead: Fed Policy Statement, Home Sales, Industrial Production Data; Fed is expected to cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point on Wednesday</span>
</div><div class="author">By WSJ Staff </div><div>317 words</div><div>15 September 2019</div><div>15:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the week ahead, the U.S. will see fresh figures on industrial production, housing starts and existing-home sales. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> will release its policy statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TUESDAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> releases U.S. industrial production data for August. U.S. industrial output fell in July, as the manufacturing sector continued to struggle with trade-related headwinds. Manufacturing output, the biggest component of industrial production, fell 0.4% in July from a month earlier. Economists will monitor this report for signs of a deepening slowdown in the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WEDNESDAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed is expected to cut its short-term benchmark by another quarter percentage point[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-lines-up-another-quarter-point-rate-cut-11567675802] on Wednesday, following its initial quarter-point cut at the end of July. The central bank's post-meeting policy statement is likely to keep the door open to another cut, as officials did after the July meeting. The Fed's quarterly interest-rate projections are heavily anticipated because they will show how many officials think rates may need to be cut again at the last two meetings of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">U.S. Commerce Department</span> releases housing starts figures for August. Home building in the U.S. fell in July for a third straight month, showing that rising labor and material costs continue to dent the pace of home construction. Economists will monitor the report for any signs of pickup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THURSDAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors releases U.S. existing-home sales figures for August. In July, sales of previously owned U.S. homes picked up, a sign that lower mortgage rates may be finally starting to drive sales after a weak spring selling season. The August report will shed light on whether the previous month's increase can be sustained.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Mene Ukueberuwa </div><div>1822 words</div><div>14 September 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Diego -- California owes its statehood in part to the 300,000 people who rushed in more than a century and a half ago, seeking their fortune in the Sierra Nevada's golden foothills. Today the Golden State's nonimmigrant population is shrinking by that amount every two years as the middle class rushes out in search of affordable homes -- a resource just as coveted and now nearly as rare. Restraining the rise of home prices has become a priority for policy makers throughout the state, whose choice of solutions could form a template for addressing similar price surges nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is worst on the coast, where employees of the booming technology industry and related fields are bidding up prices of the limited supply of homes. Reflecting on the pace of change in his city, San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer nearly stutters over his words. "The average price for a San Diego house is about $590,000," he tells me. "In 2013, it was probably, what -- no that's right: about $370,000." That's a 60% increase. Up north in San Jose, already lofty home prices nearly doubled in the same period, topping out at a median $1.1 million last summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This affects everyone, at all levels," Mr. Faulconer stresses. Home prices are out of reach of even the upper middle class, driving away families and making it tough for employers to keep talent. This year the mayor ramped up his campaign to bring prices back to earth, aligning himself with a growing movement of urban reformers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Faulconer argues that the problem is worsened by intentional limits on the housing supply. From coastal metropolises to sprawling bedroom communities, cities and towns have zoning ordinances that prevent or slow construction. "I saw it early on, when I was on the City Council," he remembers. "Good projects would be stopped for Nimby reasons, political reasons."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nimby" is an acronym for "not in my backyard," a label applied to activists who oppose local development. "Folks would say, 'Well, I'm supportive of more housing, but I just don't want it here,'" Mr. Faulconer says. Mostly homeowners worried about property values, they've long succeeded in dissuading local governments from allowing the construction of large amounts of new, denser housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the unprecedented price spike of the past decade has bolstered the numbers and influence of pro-development activists, dubbed "Yimbys." "We must change from a city that shouts, 'Not in my backyard,' to one that proclaims: 'Yes in my backyard!'" Mr. Faulconer announced in his State of the City address in January. Opposition remains strong, but the push for new housing is backed by the renter population, which has grown large enough to challenge homeowners' grip on the ballot box. Real-estate developers and local businesses provide additional muscle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yimby activists and officeholders have begun to change the housing makeup of formerly restrictive cities. Check out the timber going up around Mountain View, a few miles west of San Jose. Since voters there elected two zealous housing proponents to the City Council in 2014, <span class="companylink">Google</span> 's bustling hometown has permitted the construction of new units at about five times the rate of the previous two decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he prepares to set San Diego on a similar course, Mr. Faulconer, 52, remarks on how life in the state has changed since his childhood. He grew up an hour's drive up the coast from Los Angeles in Oxnard, where his father was deputy city manager. "As a kid, I got exposed to city government at an early age," he recalls. "I'm sure that rubbed off on me." To be sure, his dad dealt with plenty of cost issues in the 1970s: "Interest rates were sky high there for a while, the price of gas, and all of that." But as a lifelong resident of the state, Mr. Faulconer insists that "affordability has never been as acute in California as it is right now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His campaign to restrain San Diego's home prices focuses on spurring construction in denser areas, neighborhood by neighborhood. In places already designated for apartment buildings, the mayor is seeking the City Council's approval for rezoning plans that streamline the environmental-review process for new projects, with bonuses for density. Once each plan is approved, housing developers can break ground without having to "go through months and months of review, and go through endless City Council hearings."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Faulconer also won the council's approval in March to repeal parking requirements for new projects near transit centers, asserting that "a parking spot adds anywhere from $60,000 to $90,000" to the cost of an apartment unit. Next he wants to do away with building-height limits in these areas -- with an exception for the coastline -- to allow more volume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These reforms may sound meager, but Mr. Faulconer points out that the spot-by-spot plans have already resulted in permits for nearly 74,000 new homes. "There's a lot of pent-up demand," he says. "I just need to make it easier to cut away the roadblocks -- to actually get us out of the way -- and allow these units to be built."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Focusing on already dense areas is in part a concession to homeowners. Mr. Faulconer says it's meant to encourage developers to "build the housing where it should be: along transit corridors, close to job centers." He also tallies the upgrades the city is making to preserve quality of life as the population grows. "I said my goal was that we were going to pave 1,000 miles of road in five years. We hit it in 3 1/2 years and we're blowing through." He adds that "you have to provide the transit first" -- he's also expanded the trolley system -- and stresses building and restoring public parks: "I think we've done 30 by now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These improvements are made possible by the city's fiscal recovery, which Mr. Faulconer helped drive after his election to the City Council in 2006. "San Diego at the time was literally on the verge of bankruptcy. The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> dubbed us '<span class="companylink">Enron</span> by the sea.'" He and other allies of then-Mayor Jerry Sanders "fundamentally changed the pension system, and we went from a defined-benefit system to a defined contribution, and that's working." Later Mr. Faulconer backed a successful ballot measure to prevent the diversion of money raised for public works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This prudent approach to development is a feature of Mr. Faulconer's conservatism -- a label he wears lightly in a county that favored Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump by nearly 20 points. As the only Republican mayor of a U.S. city larger than one million, he avoids the impression that his administration is "a carbon copy of the national party." Yet although he describes his housing push as "not Republican or Democrat -- just common sense," his opposition to coercive methods of lowering prices puts him at odds with progressive Yimby activists, including those on the City Council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Democrat-controlled council has allied with the mayor to boost building, but it pushed further in July by voting to require that developers set aside more units for affordable housing. "Oh, a veto is clearly on the table -- absolutely," Mr. Faulconer says. "We don't want to price the construction of units out of people's ability to actually construct them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mandating low-rent units reduces the number of apartments a developer can profitably build. Simply expanding the supply is a better way of creating affordable units, he says. "We updated, a few years ago, an area called Grantville," a middle-class neighborhood where prices had spiked. "We didn't add additional affordable-housing mandates as part of that. But we're seeing that the affordable-unit production is greater than 25%."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor does he favor government regulation of rents. "You want to really prevent the construction of units? Pass rent control." And asked about a plan by Sen. Kamala Harris to subsidize renters, he demurs. "To actually move the needle in a significant way, you have to get government less involved in the production of housing, and take away the barriers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He firmly rejects one more idea catching on among Yimby activists: rezoning neighborhoods through state legislation. "Cities need to act aggressively to hit their housing goals -- that's what I'm doing," he says. "But I think you want to ensure that you have local control, so you're designing the housing that best fits your needs." Unlike fellow mayors in San Francisco, Sacramento and San Jose, he opposes California's Senate Bill 50, which would mandate higher density in neighborhoods statewide within half a mile of a commuter-train or bus station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Progressive Yimbys in other states are also breaking new ground in the scale of their reforms. Minneapolis's City Council voted last December to eliminate single-family zones altogether, and Oregon lawmakers followed suit this July by mandating multifamily zoning throughout every city of at least 10,000. The League of Oregon Cities denounced the reform, saying many towns lack the funds to scale up services on the statehouse's timeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Left-wing rhetoric is also a mainstay of the national movement. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey framed his reform as an end to "institutionalized exclusion of black, indigenous, people of color, and immigrants," and Oregon environmental groups hailed the rezoning as an anti-climate-change measure, bound to take thousands of cars off the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, Mr. Faulconer hopes to capture the zeal of the pro-development cause but expand housing in a focused manner capable of sustaining broad support. "You cannot be successful if you don't bring on consensus," he says, "especially with the community groups. We're not doing it in the middle of single-family neighborhoods, 20 miles outside of downtown. So there is a balance you always have to keep in mind."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The day I met the mayor, the council faced votes on new plans for the Pacific Beach and Clairemont regions, which would add 9,000 homes within two years. Mr. Faulconer waxes sentimental while describing the stakes, calling the new housing "an economic imperative for our city, and also, I believe, a moral imperative for our families." Yet he snaps back into form when he considers the scale of the price problem, and the political tact it will take to keep bringing new housing to life. "We build consensus by getting the community plans developed. But then, damn it, let's make it easier to build it! Let's actually go!" Both plans passed unanimously.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James Glynn </div><div>405 words</div><div>9 September 2019</div><div>06:14</div><div>WSJ Pro Central Banking</div><div>RSTPROCB</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2019, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SYDNEY—Australia's housing market has bubbled back to life, supported by midyear interest-rate cuts, a reduction in income taxes and moves by banking regulators to ease mortgage-lending rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of housing-finance approvals in July jumped 4.2% from June, easily beating expectations for a 1.5% increase, while the value of loans to investors climbed 4.7%, according to <span class="companylink">Australian Bureau of Statistics</span> Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jump in housing activity comes as residential auction sales in the major state capitals of Sydney and Melbourne have climbed sharply. House prices were higher in August, with the bigger regional markets again leading the bounce, according to property-research firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the revival in housing could spur a broader economic recovery, economists warn that it could also complicate the interest-rate outlook given that the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of Australia</span> would prefer avoiding lowering rates if all it achieves is a resurgence in house prices and growth in debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The RBA is unlikely to be impressed by these numbers. It would not want a repeat of the housing boom that we had prior to 2017, given already high levels of household debt," said Adelaide Timbrell, an economist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the housing market rapidly gathers momentum again, expect banking regulators to again consider some tightening of lending rules "sooner rather than later," she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the housing bounce will help ease concerns that the economy could be headed into its first recession in nearly 30 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy at grew its slowest on-year pace since 2009 in the second quarter, with a jump in exports preventing it from contracting over previous the three months. Stronger demand for housing will buoy retailers and construction firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Well it might trigger better growth but it's not really the growth we want," said Sally Auld, chief economist at JP Morgan. "It will just make the vulnerability (of record household debt) worse down the track."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the extent of the economic slowdown over the last year, Australia needs to find more sources of GDP growth. But it looks like Australia is returning to "familiar dynamics" of relying on a boom in housing to keep the economy moving, Ms. Auld added.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jessica Menton </div><div>483 words</div><div>4 September 2019</div><div>03:35</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of home-improvement retailers weathered the storm in markets in August and are poised to keep climbing as the hurricane season ramps up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The retail sector has been a bright spot in a volatile period for stocks, as recent economic data have shown consumer spending remained strong[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-consumer-spending-rose-sharply-in-july-11567168319] and Washington delayed some tariffs[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-will-delay-some-tariffs-against-china-11565704420] on Chinese goods until December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-improvement stocks have done especially well, with shares of <span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Lowe's Cos</span>. and <span class="companylink">Floor &amp; Decor Holdings Inc</span>. gaining 6.7%, 11% and 26%, respectively, in August. In comparison, the broader S&amp;P 500 dropped 1.8% in the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors feared that a weak housing market, slowing global growth and a drop in consumer confidence would hurt demand at the retailers. But <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> and <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> both posted higher sales for their latest quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is too early to tell what the effect on the retail sector will be as the East Coast braces for Hurricane Dorian this week. But analysts say the home-improvement companies could benefit as consumers make preparations for storms by buying generators and plywood, along with cleanup and repair activity including new roofing and flooring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home-improvement retailers in particular tend to see a bump in their stock prices in anticipation of people rushing to board up their houses ahead of a storm," said Steve Frazier, president at Frazier Investment Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The retailers have historically seen a sales boost after a bout of mother nature. In the third quarter of 2017 when Hurricanes Irma, Nate and Harvey hit the U.S., <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> saw a rise of $282 million in initial sales after affected customers bought plywood, bricks, drywall and roofing material. Meanwhile, <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> hurricane-related sales in the same three-month period were roughly $200 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> and <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> have a big presence in Florida, with 153 and 126 stores in the state, respectively, as of the end of 2018. That represents 8% and 7% of their U.S. fleets, according to Jefferies. Floor &amp; Decor had 18 stores, representing 18% of its total, the firm said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, some risks remain. The potential for store closures, disruption at distribution centers and expenses from damages in affected regions threaten to put a lid on retailers' bottom lines in the near term, some analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Higher hurricane sales may not drive increased [earnings before interest and taxes] dollars, as the incremental margins could be offset by the additional expenses," analysts at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Securities</span> said in a research note last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> fell 1.7% and those of <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> lost 0.9% Tuesday as the broader market tumbled on disappointing manufacturing data.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decadelong economic expansion has showered the U.S. with staggering new wealth driven by a booming stock market and rising house prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that windfall has passed by many Americans. The bottom half of all U.S. households, as measured by wealth, have only recently regained the wealth lost in the 2007-09 recession and still have 32% less wealth, adjusted for inflation, than in 2003, according to recent <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> figures. The top 1% of households have more than twice as much as they did in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This points to a potentially worrisome side of the expansion, now the longest on record. If another recession comes, it could be devastating for people who have only just recovered from the last one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealth, also called net worth, is the value of assets such as houses, savings and stocks minus debt such as mortgages and credit-card balances. Net worth is different from income, the cash a household receives each month such as wages, dividends and government benefits. It is common for countries to have a highly skewed wealth distribution. Nonetheless, in the U.S., wealth inequality has grown faster than income inequality in the past decade, making the current wealth gap the widest in the postwar period, according to a study by Moritz Kuhn, Moritz Schularick and Ulrike Steins, economists at the University of Bonn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behind this trend: More than 85% of the assets of the wealthiest 1% are in financial assets such as stocks, bonds or stakes in private companies. By contrast, slightly more than half of all assets owned by the bottom 50% of households comes from real estate, such as the family home. Economic and regulatory trends during the past decade haven't only favored stock over housing wealth, but have made it more difficult for the less affluent to even buy a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until the mid-2000s, the net worth of households across the wealth distribution increased at roughly the same pace, keeping inequality stable. That started to change when housing prices took off in the early 2000s. For the bottom 50%, rising home values were more than offset by mortgage debt, which almost doubled between 2003 and 2007. For the top 1%, debt was flat between those years. When the housing bubble burst, many less-affluent households saw housing wealth wiped out; some lost their homes altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the bottom half of American households aren't carrying so much debt compared with the prerecession peak, after adjusting for inflation. And starting in 2012, a recovery in home prices has allowed their net worth to inch up. But house prices, adjusted for inflation, have yet to reach their 2006 peak, according to the S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a decade of rising equity prices has buoyed the 1% wealthiest households, pushing the value of their financial assets up 72% since the recession, after adjusting for inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Structural economic forces have affected the wealth of the rich and the lower-middle class differently. The Fed kept interest rates near zero and bought bonds in the years after the crisis to revive the economy, in the process amplifying the run-up in asset prices. "Who owns that stuff? Rich people," said Karen Petrou, managing partner at <span class="companylink">Federal Financial Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the share of families in the bottom half who own a home has fallen to about 37% in 2016, the latest year for which data are available, from 43% in 2007, according to the Fed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those who lost a house during the recession or never had one, getting a toehold in homeownership has become more difficult. Partly because of regulations designed to prevent another crisis, banks have toughened credit standards and down-payment requirements, said Susan Wachter, a University of Pennsylvania economist. Had the looser, prerecession credit standards stayed, the proportion of Americans who own their home would have been 5.2 percentage points higher in 2010-2013, a study by Ms. Wachter and three co-authors estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have focused on higher-end homes for those with good credit and high incomes. As a result, affordable homes have become scarcer and more expensive. Between 2011 and 2017, the inflation-adjusted price of a starter home rose 56%, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a data provider. Real median incomes increased 12%, according to the Census.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Veronica Cortez, a 30-year-old municipal employee in San Fernando, Calif., is working on paying down her debts. She takes home between $3,500 and $4,000 a month depending on overtime, of which about half goes for the rent on the two-bedroom apartment she shares with her two children. She intends to buy a home, but "here in California it's expensive," she said. "You pretty much live paycheck to paycheck. It's going to be impossible for me to save up $20,000 or $30,000 for a down payment." She has set aside $6,000, so far, and plans to apply to assistance programs to help cover the rest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealth helps households weather the ups and downs of the business cycle. In good times, they pay for living expenses out of their income and set the remainder aside. In bad times, when layoffs hit, those savings can help pay bills. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Households with little wealth, however, are more exposed to the vagaries of the economy. Areas that saw a bigger drop in housing wealth after the recession also suffered a sharper decline in consumption, according to research by economists Atif Mian, Kamalesh Rao and Amir Sufi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If no shock is happening then everything is fine, but if a shock is happening you have a much more fragile economy," said Mr. Kuhn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leticia Segura's house in the West Humboldt Park neighborhood of Chicago lost about half its value during the recession, she said. Today, it is worth about $250,000, still almost $30,000 short of its value in 2007, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Segura and her husband, Jesus, almost lost the home to foreclosure during the crisis after Mr. Segura lost his job and the couple fell behind on mortgage payments. A government program helped the couple get current, but they remained underwater on their mortgage until just a few months ago, meaning they owed more than their home's value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, both have new jobs and Ms. Segura feels more comfortable financially. But the couple remains cautious. They have set aside some money to cover the mortgage for three or four months should disaster strike again. "After that we'd just have to pray," she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tropical Storm</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heads for Island</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tropical storm Dorian made a last-minute shift in its path on Tuesday, threatening Puerto Rico with a direct hit as forecasters said it could reach near-hurricane strength in its approach to the U.S. territory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The storm is expected to pass over or near western and central Puerto Rico on Wednesday as authorities warned of landslides, widespread flooding and power outages. President Trump declared an emergency Tuesday night and ordered federal assistance for local authorities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Practically the entire island will be under sustained tropical storm force winds," said Roberto Garcia, director of U.S. National Weather Service San Juan. However, he said the forecast could change overnight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change in the storm's course concerned many across the U.S. territory, where some 30,000 homes still have blue tarps as roofs nearly two years after Hurricane Maria. The island's 3.2 million inhabitants still depend on a shaky power grid that has remained prone to outages.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Continues to Slow</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth continued to decelerate in June, the latest sign that lower mortgage rates are providing little boost to a housing market that has been slowing for the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average national home prices grew 3.1% in the year ended in June, according to the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, down from a 3.3% annual pace the prior month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A federal judge temporarily blocked parts of a Missouri law that would have prohibited abortions after eight weeks of pregnancy, putting on hold one of the most restrictive limitations on abortion in the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law, which provided exemptions for medical emergencies but not for cases of incest or rape, was slated to take effect Wednesday. U.S. Western District of Missouri Senior Judge Howard F. Sachs issued the order after hearing oral arguments Monday. The preliminary injunction prevents the law from taking effect while the lawsuit moves forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"However formulated," Judge Sachs wrote, "the legislation on its face conflicts with the Supreme Court ruling that neither legislative nor judicial limits on abortion can be measured by specified weeks of development of a fetus; instead, 'viability' is the sole test for a State's authority to prohibit abortions where there is no maternal health issue."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> House Price Index, also released Tuesday, similarly showed that home-price growth has decelerated for the last 15 months. Home prices rose just under 5% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, a significant slowdown from nearly 7% appreciation during the same period in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The majority of states and cities are experiencing slower house price gains than they did a year ago, even with constrained housing supply and extremely attractive mortgage rates," said William Doerner, a supervisory economist at FHFA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Prices are growing fastest in secondary cities[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/in-boise-and-grand-rapids-the-housing-market-looks-red-hot-11565521202], where homes are still relatively affordable.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price gains were much weaker in coastal markets. Seattle, the New York City metro area and Oxnard, Calif., were all in the bottom 10 cities for price appreciation in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, economists said there are signs that price growth is stabilizing and a crash in prices looks unlikely.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING—<span class="companylink">China's central bank</span> adjusted interest-rate mechanisms Sunday for the second time this month, this time focused on mortgage loans, in what it said was a bid to price them closer to market rates but also in ways that might avoid further inflating property prices[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-trouble-with-rate-cuts-in-china-11566385540?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=2].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new policy came one week after the <span class="companylink">People's Bank of China</span> unveiled a new benchmark interest-rate system[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chinas-central-bank-reforms-rates-to-boost-cheap-funding-for-businesses-11566030141?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=5] meant to more closely align with market signals. In the short term, the move could lower interest rates[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/chinas-central-bank-sets-new-benchmark-lending-rates-lower-11566266890?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=4] and make them more responsive to the central bank's monetary-policy adjustments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When authorities announced the new benchmark system, they said the changes wouldn't affect the pricing of mortgage loans. Analysts read the move as further indication that Beijing is concerned that China's already-high home prices would spike higher if borrowing rates were lowered. Now the central bank says future mortgage rates will be based on Loan Prime Rate, or LPR, the new benchmark rate system, at the heart of the restructuring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement on Sunday, the <span class="companylink">PBOC</span> said new mortgage loans would also be priced based on LPR from Oct. 8. New mortgage loan rates for first-home buyers shouldn't be lower than related LPRs. It also said rates for second-home buyers have to be at least 60 basis points higher than LPRs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the latest LPRs released last week, the move could bring new mortgage loan rates lower than current floors, according to calculations by The Wall Street Journal based on official data. Economists have widely estimated that the LPRs will trend down in coming months as the government moves to stimulate borrowing amid a domestic slowdown and re-escalating trade conflict with the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an attempt to control mortgage rates, the central bank also said Sunday that its branches would release mortgage-rate floors for local lenders based on property policies applied in different localities. That could give the central bank more sway in keeping mortgage rates from falling so far that they could stoke property bubbles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's large cities have maintained tighter property controls by curbing home purchases and sticker-mortgage policies given their already hefty home prices, while some small cities, with a small population base, usually apply more accommodative policy to boost home purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">PBOC</span> said that interest rates for commercial properties should be at least 60 basis-points higher than LPRs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers could negotiate with lenders on how to reprice their mortgage loans each year based on changes of the LPR.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned U.S. homes picked up in July, a sign that lower mortgage rates may be finally starting to drive sales after a weak spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July marked the first year-over-year uptick in 17 months and economists have been somewhat puzzled why the lowest mortgage rates in nearly 50 years, strong employment and wages edging higher have failed to spark more home buying. The July activity was one of the few signs that these forces may be starting to translate into more sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose 2.5% in July from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.42 million, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected sales to rise 2.3% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with a year earlier, sales in July rose 0.6%, the first uptick after uninterrupted year-over-year declines since February 2018. Purchases of previously owned homes account for the bulk of U.S. home buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were up 2.7% annually in the South last month, making it the strongest performing region, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>'s report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central Florida sales have been aided by a steady influx of new residents, said Jeff Fagan, an Orlando real-estate agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Lawrence Yun, the trade group's chief economist, said July's increase was an "inevitable realization given incredibly low mortgage rates," alongside strong job conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other economists cautioned against making too much of one month's activity, and noted that limited inventory and high prices in many markets across the U.S. remain headwinds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in Orlando, like much of the rest of the country, there is a drought of lower-cost options for first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right now we would still love to see an increase in the $300,000 and below market," Mr. Fagan said. "That would be very welcome."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shortage of homes means home prices remain high. The median sales price for an existing home in July was $280,800, up 4.3% from a year earlier. In some large markets, however, the median price of lower-end homes has appreciated by more than 100% since 2012, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>, further limiting the pool of eligible buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a 4.2-month supply of homes on the market at July's end, but economists say healthier inventory would measure at least six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">June's sales were revised higher, to a 5.29 million annual rate from an earlier estimate of 5.27 million.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ben Eisen </div><div>781 words</div><div>22 August 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risky mortgage is making a comeback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than a decade after home loans triggered the worst financial crisis in a generation, the strict lending requirements put in place during its aftermath are starting to erode. Home buyers with low credit scores or high debt levels as well as those lacking traditional employment are finding it easier to get credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loans have been rebranded. Largely gone are the monikers subprime and Alt-A, a type of mortgage that earned the nickname "liar loan" because so many borrowers faked their income and assets. Now they are called non-qualified, or non-QM, because they don't comply with postcrisis standards set by the <span class="companylink">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span> for preventing borrowers from getting loans they can't afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers took out $45 billion of these unconventional loans in 2018, the most in a decade, and origination is on track to rise again in 2019, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry research group. Such mortgages aren't guaranteed by government agencies and typically charge higher interest rates than conventional loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growth in unconventional loans comes as the housing market starts to show signs of rebounding. July marked the first year-over-year uptick in sales of previously owned homes in 17 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proponents of unconventional loans argue that mortgages became too hard to get in the aftermath of the crisis and that their proliferation will open the housing market to sound borrowers who had been shut out. But some worry that the competition for customers could drive lenders to loosen standards too much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It doesn't rise to the same level yet, to my knowledge, of some of the things taking place just prior to the crisis," said Eric Kaplan, director of the housing finance program at the <span class="companylink">Milken Institute</span>. "But we have to be vigilant."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unconventional loans are largely being extended by nonbank mortgage lenders, but big banks have found another way in. <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co</span>., <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group AG</span> and <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>. have in recent months been arranging mortgage bonds backed by unconventional loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some $2.5 billion worth of subprime loans, those with FICO credit scores below 690, ended up in mortgage bonds in the first quarter of 2019. That is more than double a year earlier and the highest level since the end of 2007, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. There was $1.9 billion worth of subprime mortgage bonds in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for unconventional home loans is still tiny compared with the rest of the mortgage market as well as the state of the industry before the crisis, when unconventional borrowing peaked at more than $1 trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the increase in unconventional loans shows that lenders are looking farther afield for customers. As the U.S. economic expansion ages and home prices rise faster than incomes for most Americans, the mortgage industry is finding a limited number of cream-of-the-crop borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greg Licht had a lot of business debt and a FICO credit score of under 600 when he applied to refinance his mortgage. He also had hundreds of thousands of dollars of equity in the San Clemente, Calif., home where he has lived for more than two decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That made him an appealing borrower to an unconventional lender, said Tom Jessop, a loan consultant at New American Funding. Mr. Jessop arranged a $675,000 loan on the $1.1 million property, leaving a significant buffer should Mr. Licht default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Licht was able to pull cash out of his home and pay down business debt. He is paying above-market interest and plans to refinance at a lower rate once his credit improves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now my job is to work on FICO scores," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, home prices have risen rapidly over the past decade, raising concern that much of the equity homeowners have built up could evaporate if market conditions turn. Recently, the housing market has shown signs of cooling on the West Coast. That is another risk lenders must weigh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As lenders inch back into mortgages that got them in trouble in the last housing bubble, the key to avoiding a repeat, they said, is to be careful that borrowers don't overextend themselves. That can mean allowing a borrower to have one risk -- say, a low or absent credit score -- that is offset by an area of strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we've been doing is taking measured risk," said Tom Hutchens, an executive vice president at Angel Oak Mortgage Solutions, one of the biggest providers of unconventional loans.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned U.S. homes picked up in July, a sign that lower mortgage rates may be finally starting to drive sales after a weak spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July marked the first year-over-year uptick in 17 months and economists have been somewhat puzzled why the lowest mortgage rates in nearly 50 years [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/lower-mortgage-rates-arent-likely-to-reverse-sagging-home-sales-11565361792], strong employment and wages edging higher have failed to spark more home buying. The July activity was one of the few signs that these forces may be starting to translate into more sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose 2.5% in July from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.42 million, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday [https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/existing-home-sales-climb-2-5-in-july]. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected sales to rise 2.3% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with a year earlier, sales in July rose 0.6%, the first uptick after uninterrupted year-over-year declines since February 2018. Purchases of previously owned homes account for the bulk of U.S. homebuying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the trade group's chief economist, said July's increase was an "inevitable realization given incredibly low mortgage rates," alongside strong job conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other economists cautioned against making too much of one month's activity, and noted that limited inventory and high prices in many markets across the U.S. remain headwinds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were up 2.7% annually in the South this July, making it the strongest performing region, according to NAR's report. Central Florida sales have been aided by a steady influx of new residents, said Jeff Fagan, an Orlando real-estate agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in Orlando, like much of the rest of the country, there is a drought of lower-cost options for first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right now we would still love to see an increase in the $300,000 and below market," Mr. Fagan said. "That would be very welcome."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shortage of homes means home prices remain high. The median sales price for an existing home in July was $280,800, up 4.3% from a year earlier. In some large markets, however, the median price of lower-end homes has appreciated by more than 100% since 2012, according to NAR, further limiting the pool of eligible buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a 4.2-month supply of homes on the market at the end of July, but economists say healthier inventory would measure at least six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are still facing affordability concerns and homes are still very expensive…That's not going away," said Matthew Speakman, an economist at Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the second half of the year, low inventory remains a challenge for the market, Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The job market still remains strong but there is increasing economic uncertainty," he said, adding "people may be hesitant to buy a home if they think we may be facing an economic recession."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers have also worried about the effects of the U.S. trade dispute with China, and concerns of slower economic growth has been fueled in recent weeks by some indicators, such a bond yields, that now suggest the possibility of a recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If people aren't optimistic about the state of the economy in the coming months and years, they're less likely to buy a house," Mr. Speakman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department last week reported that home building fell in July for the third straight month. Housing starts, a measure of new-home construction, fell 4% in July from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.191 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers have also seen sales jump one month, only to prove an aberration rather than the beginning of sustained turnaround. In February, existing home sales rose 11.8% from the prior month, which was the second-strongest monthly gain in home sales ever. But sales then were still behind where they were at the same time in 2018, marking only brief spark before the start of a tepid spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the housing market's slight pickup last month is a positive sign for the sector. Mortgage rates have been dropping steadily in recent months. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in July was 3.77%, down from 4.46% six months earlier, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">June's sales were revised higher, to a 5.29 million annual rate from an earlier estimate of 5.27 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that capped a weak spring selling season overall. The spring is crucial to the housing market because roughly 40% of the year's sales take place in March through June.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>. lowered its sales forecast and warned that falling lumber prices -- as well as the potential effects of tariffs on U.S. consumers -- could weigh on growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-improvement retailer said fiscal 2019 sales growth would increase by 2.3%, down from its previous guidance of 3.3%. Same-store sales were projected to grow by about 4%, a percentage point lower than its previous forecast. The company affirmed its earnings guidance, projecting per-share earnings growth of about 3.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower lumber prices, crimping what <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> can charge customers, have resulted in about $340 million in lost revenue from a year ago, Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome said on a call with analysts on Tuesday.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company also said the potential role of tariffs factored into its revised guidance. Chief Executive Craig Menear said in a conference call that <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> has to weigh the uncertainty around the tariffs and the potential "total impact on the customer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ted Decker, executive vice president of merchandising, said on the call that he and his team have been negotiating with merchants and suppliers to limit the tariff effects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of customer transactions was flat from a year ago, while the amount of money customers spent per visit rose 1.7%, and big-ticket transactions, or the number of comparable transactions over $1,000, climbed 3.7% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The consumer is healthy today," Ms. Tome said in an interview, citing the number of customers and transactions <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> sees in stores and online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said consumer confidence is high, wages are up and homeowners are spending right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Same-store sales -- a common metric in retail based on revenue at stores open at least one year -- rose 3%. Analysts expected a 3.3% rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall sales for the Atlanta company rose 1.2% from a year ago to $30.84 billion, slightly behind analysts' estimates of $31 billion, according to FactSet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

Home Depot Withstands Housing Fears --- A mixed earnings report is enough to send shares higher as investors apparently were steeled for worse</span>
</div><div class="author">By Justin Lahart </div><div>505 words</div><div>21 August 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B14</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a company releases results that can be described as "mixed," the natural inclination is to ask how far the stock fell. For <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, however, a mixed second quarter was enough to send its stock sharply higher Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-improvement retailer said that it earned $3.17 a share in its fiscal second quarter ended Aug. 4, topping analyst estimates. But its sales of $30.8 billion were a bit light, and same-store sales growth of 3% also was short of estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, the company lowered its sales forecast for the entire fiscal year, saying it now expects 4% same-store-sales growth, down from an earlier forecast of 5%. This was partly due to the effects of lower lumber prices. But the company also warned that the effects of tariffs on consumers could weigh on growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet investors had apparently steeled themselves for worse. <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> shares rose more than 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors' low expectations may reflect ingrained skepticism over <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>'s ability to weather a weak housing market. Home sales were down in the first half of this year from a year earlier and home-price gains have moderated, so it is natural to worry the company has experienced a dent in demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> appears far less tied to home sales than it was before the housing bust. This seems to be driven in part by many homeowners' decision to invest in the house they already have rather than going out and buying a new one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also is a reflection of how old homes in the U.S. are getting. As of 2016, the median age of owner-occupied homes in the U.S. was 37 years, according to a National <span class="companylink">Association of Home Builders</span>' analysis, compared with 31 years a decade earlier. The regular upkeep these aging homes require to maintain their value provides a steady source of income for <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> also is benefiting from the travails of <span class="companylink">Sears</span>, a once formidable seller of appliances and tools, which filed for bankruptcy last fall and continues to close stores. <span class="companylink">Lowe's Cos</span>. also has been paring back stores as part of its turnaround plan, easing the competitive pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That isn't to say that <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> is immune to trouble. If tariffs start hurting consumers, then consumers aren't going to be so ready to get started on big home-improvement projects and <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>'s sales will suffer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, however, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> says its real-time sales figures haven't registered any tariff effects. Its caution seems directed at what might happen, rather than anything it is actually seeing. For investors who have been spending the past month worrying that the economy already is sliding into a tariff-induced slowdown, that counts as great news.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultralow interest rates are making it a miserable year for Japanese banks, with many stocks hitting historic lows. The bad news is that things can still get worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For <span class="companylink">Chiba Bank</span>, in particular, the market doesn't yet seem to be fully accounting for all the risks it faces as one of the country's largest regional lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank is already priced for misery, at just 0.42 times its book value. Yet the current state of affairs may actually be as good as it gets: Defaults are so low as to be practically nonexistent, economic growth is low but positive—not a guaranteed state of affairs in Japan—and nonperforming loans are minimal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The squeeze on margins[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/japanese-banks-are-circling-the-drain-11565089206] caused by three decades of declining and now subzero benchmark interest rates has cut <span class="companylink">Chiba Bank</span>'s interest income as a share of total assets in half over the last 10 years, down to below 0.25%. Unlike the country's megabanks, such as <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi UFJ Financial</span> and <span class="companylink">Sumitomo Mitsui Financial</span>, it can't reasonably escape by venturing overseas for other assets[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-bank-for-japanese-farmers-that-fuels-the-global-lending-market-11550502026].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the bank has garnered significant exposure to the property market in its home prefecture southeast of Tokyo. Commercial real-estate loans, mostly against rented housing, now make up around 27% of the bank's loan book, up nearly 5 percentage points in as many years. Household mortgages account for another 35% of the book.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The residential vacancy rate in the region, where the bank's loans are overwhelmingly concentrated, runs to almost 17%, up from below 13% four years ago and higher than in neighboring Kanagawa and Saitama, according to real estate information company TAS Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So <span class="companylink">Chiba Bank</span> is exposed not only to the margin pressure haunting all of Japan's regional banks, but also the particular risk of a downturn in a single prefecture's property market that is already showing signs of strain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any knock to the housing market in Japan caused by an economic downturn would hit <span class="companylink">Chiba Bank</span> disproportionately hard. And if the <span class="companylink">Bank of Japan</span> attempts to combat economic problems by cutting interest rates even further[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/boj-policy-makers-butt-heads-over-banks-complaints-1536831257], as it insists it is prepared to do, the pressure on profitability would be compounded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike European banks, which have similar profitability challenges but look increasingly well-capitalized after years of painful fundraising, many of Japan's lenders have moved in the opposite direction. <span class="companylink">Chiba Bank</span>'s Tier 1 capital ratio stands at 12%, down by around a percentage point in the last four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oddly, the stock has yet to plumb new lows during the current sector selloff, keeping above its 2012 and 2016 troughs even though the lender's prospects have probably deteriorated. It can't be too long before the market catches up with the grim reality for <span class="companylink">Chiba Bank</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two devices that appeared to be pressure cookers were discovered at about 7 a.m. in the Fulton Street subway station, but they didn't have explosives in them, police said.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span> said Friday its preliminary index of consumer sentiment for August was 92.1, down from July's reading of 98.4.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumers concluded, following the Fed's lead, that they may need to reduce spending in anticipation of a potential recession," said Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. households also strongly reacted to President Trump's early August move to extend tariffs to essentially all Chinese imports from Sept. 1, he said.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Home building in the U.S. fell for a third straight month, showing that rising labor and material costs continue to dent the pace of home construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts, a measure of new-home construction, fell 4% in July  [http://www.census.gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf]from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.191 million, the Commerce Department said Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential building permits, which can signal how much construction is in the pipeline, rose 8.4% from June to an annual pace of 1.336 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 1.0% drop in housing starts and a 4.1% increase for permits last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-starts data are volatile from month to month and can be subject to large revisions. July's 4% decline for starts came with a margin of error of 8.0 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts were up 0.6% from July last year and building permits were up 1.5% from July 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Northeast saw the sharpest dip in housing starts with a decline of 13.8% from June. Building permits were also down 3.3% from the previous month in the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite historically low mortgage rates and rising wages, the housing sector has been strained by a low inventory of affordable homes propelled by rising construction costs and lack of land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average rates for 30-year mortgages are at their lowest level in nearly three years, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said Thursday. The National <span class="companylink">Association of Home Builders</span> also reported Thursday that builder confidence in the market for new single-family homes rose in August and said demand for homes, particularly at lower price points, is strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders have struggled to keep up with demand, as the tight job market has created labor shortages, raised labor costs and prolonged construction. Tariffs on Canadian lumber and certain Chinese materials, like quartz and granite, have also made building materials more expensive.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Mike Bird </div><div>407 words</div><div>16 August 2019</div><div>08:35</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese state power may have found its limit in the effort to keep household debt in check.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beijing is wisely wary of the decade-long boom in China's housing market, the consequent build-up in borrowing and what it means for the country's development model. But in the data there is no sign of a crackdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, in its annual Article IV assessment of the Chinese economy, the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> raised its forecasts for Chinese household debt by several percentage points. The <span class="companylink">IMF</span> expects household debt to rise to 56.2% of GDP this year, and as high as 67.9% of GDP in 2024. The latter figure would be well above current levels in Japan and the eurozone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on activity in the housing market, where the majority of household debt is generated, the <span class="companylink">IMF</span> is right to cast doubt on Beijing's plans to deleverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past 12 months, developers have booked a record 11.7 trillion yuan ($1.66 trillion) in pre-sales—sales of homes due to be completed in the years ahead. Assuming that buyers put down a deposit of around 30%, that is north of 8 trillion yuan in mortgage debt not yet fully on the shoulders of the household sector. Until the property is built, mortgage debt acquired for forward delivery of housing is taken on by buyers but guaranteed by developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In comparison, Chinese household debt rose by 7.3 trillion yuan between the end of 2017 and the end of 2018, according to data from the <span class="companylink">Bank for International Settlements</span>. Assuming there will be a little bit of mortgage repayment too, a similar increase seems likely in 2019 from pre-sale mortgage debt alone. That excludes any mortgage debt raised to buy completed homes as well as any other forms of consumer credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government has good reasons to want to stop the buildup. Many emerging markets have struggled to regain[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/banking-giants-are-mortgaging-chinas-future-11554364772] high levels of growth after generating considerable property-related debt, particularly in Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is no sign that household debt is even plateauing, let alone declining. Beijing's stated preference is for an end to speculative household borrowing, but it is proving to be a difficult habit to kick.</p>

Keller Williams Expands Its Reach in Online Home Sales</span>
</div><div class="author">By Will Parker </div><div>425 words</div><div>15 August 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate firm Keller Williams is joining with home-sales platform Offerpad, expanding its reach into the rapidly growing market of algorithm-driven home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The realty franchise entered the all-cash online sales market known as iBuying in May. The new agreement will give Offerpad first dibs any time a Keller Williams customer wants to sell to an iBuyer instead of putting their home on the open market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The partnership starts in Phoenix and Dallas, Keller Williams said. The firm plans to include 10 other markets by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IBuyers use algorithms to identify homes that can be purchased at a discount and sold again quickly. Sellers usually choose to sell at a discount to an iBuyer because it is faster and easier than a formal sales process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Keller Williams decided to join with Chandler, Ariz.-based Offerpad after the initial rollout of its iBuyer outfit, Keller Offers, performed below expectations, said Gayln Ziegler, director of operations for Keller Offers. If Offerpad passes on a listing, Keller Offers can then give a seller its own quote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through Offerpad, Keller Williams hopes to increase its deal volume by 3,000 sales a year, Ms. Ziegler said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the early popularity of iBuying startups like Opendoor, real-estate companies like <span class="companylink">Zillow Group Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Redfin Corp</span>. introduced their own programs. The sector of the sales market has grown quickly. In Phoenix, a top market for these sales, nearly 7% of transactions involved an iBuyer in December, according to an analysis from Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The iBuyer business is one of low margins, so high volume is necessary to make it profitable. This is easier in a market where prices have been steadily rising, as they have for much of the past several years. But the rapid-sales process could be more challenging when home prices are flat or falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Offerpad previously was part of a similar pilot program with Zillow that ended last year after Zillow decided it would begin buying and selling homes itself. The new venture with Keller Williams is much more formalized, said Brian Bair, founder and CEO of Offerpad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Opendoor struck an agreement with the brokerage Redfin, which will allow sellers to request a quote from Opendoor on its website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a recent earnings call, Redfin's CEO, Glenn Kelman, said the move was meant to allow users to get access to iBuyer offers when it can't meet demand.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>904 words</div><div>14 August 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An earlier photo accompanying this article, since removed, incorrectly said it showed a condo/apartment complex under construction in Denver in 2017. That photo was of Denver's Source hotel. (Aug. 16, 2019)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trump administration is vastly expanding the scope of condominium purchases eligible for lower-down-payment loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move, announced Wednesday by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>, could help revive the entry-level condo market for first-time buyers because <span class="companylink">FHA</span>-backed loans require only a 3.5% down payment and lower credit score than conventional loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also loosens financial-crisis-era rules and could expose the government to a higher likelihood of loan default if the housing market continues to slow and prices fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">FHA</span> insured a million home loans last year made by banks and other private lenders, the vast majority of which were for single-family homes. With the new rules, the agency estimates it could insure as many as 60,000 additional condo loans each year, on top of the 16,000 condo loans it backed in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condos are a more affordable alternative for first-time buyers in cities like Seattle, Austin and Denver, where single-family homes are increasingly out of reach for many. The median price of an existing condo or co-op unit was just over $260,000 in June, compared with nearly $290,000 for the median existing single-family home, the National Association of Realtors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is set to really expand homeownership," said Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which oversees the <span class="companylink">FHA</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skeptics say now is a risky time for the government to back more condo loans. David Stevens, retired chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association, who ran the <span class="companylink">FHA</span> through the fallout from the 2008 housing crisis, said he worries about repeating the mistakes of the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"<span class="companylink">FHA</span> is already a higher-risk program," Mr. Stevens said. "Layer that on top of a higher-risk product called the condominium, and you definitely have to prepare yourself for the fact that in the next correction you're going to take more losses at <span class="companylink">FHA</span> than anywhere else."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stevens said condos are a dicier proposition because units in a building can be turned into rentals, which tend to be less well-maintained. A single foreclosure in a condo building can affect other units as windows aren't washed, balconies aren't painted and maintenance dues aren't paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason the <span class="companylink">FHA</span> became enmeshed in risky condo loans during the previous housing boom was a practice known as spot approvals. Entire condo buildings are supposed to be certified before borrowers can get <span class="companylink">FHA</span> loans there, but the agency began routinely making exceptions and granting individual loans, Mr. Stevens recalls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beginning in 2008, the <span class="companylink">FHA</span> tightened its lending standards for condos, including eliminating spot approvals. Condo lending became a niche part of its business: Only 6.5% of the 150,000 condo projects in the U.S. are FHA-certified.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the <span class="companylink">FHA</span> will once again approve loans for individual units in buildings that aren't certified. FHA Commissioner Brian Montgomery said the agency has tightened requirements to avoid the abuses of the last housing boom. Individual loans will be approved in most buildings only if no more than 10% of the loans are to <span class="companylink">FHA</span> borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes have been in the works since 2016 but hit a pause during the switch in presidential administrations before agency officials revisited the policy details.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new rules won't help the struggling luxury-condo markets in Miami or New York. <span class="companylink">FHA</span> loans are targeted at moderate-income borrowers and are capped at around $350,000 in Miami and around $730,000 in the New York area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A low-down-payment loan did help Ryan Bielby, a 27-year-old voice designer in Seattle, afford his first home. Mr. Bielby has been living for about five years in Capitol Hill, where single-family homes in the area were completely out of his price range of $300,000 to $400,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He found a top-floor condo unit with views of the city and hardwood floors and was able to afford it putting about 5% down. Mr. Bielby said he had spent several years saving for that down payment and didn't want to wait much longer. "I wanted to start putting more money down to start building up some equity," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, said the new rules could help stimulate demand from more moderate-income buyers and boost the housing market late in the cycle. Still, he said that unless builders shift from building luxury apartments to condos, supply shortages at the lower end will persist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is bringing additional potential demand, and right now we are in a housing shortage, so this is a move in the right direction but clearly we need more supply," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's an insurable risk. Just do it with your eyes open," said Ed Golding, a fellow at the Urban Institute and former FHA commissioner during the Obama administration. "It's too important a part of the housing stock to just completely ignore."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is booming. Just not in the places you might expect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes for sale in small to midsize cities like Boise, Idaho; South Bend, Ind.; Columbia, Mo.; and Youngstown, Ohio, are enjoying a sustained upswing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the crucial spring selling season, only 10 of 178 metropolitan areas had double-digit annual price increases, down from two dozen in the second quarter of 2018, according to the National Association of Realtors. Nearly all of those high-growth areas were in less-expensive, smaller markets, where home prices are now rising faster than incomes, inventory levels are shrinking, and bidding wars are breaking out, especially for starter homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've seen this shift to the center of the country," said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, a Seattle-based real-estate brokerage. "It used to be flyover country, and now it's saving our bacon."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national housing market and the economy have been on separate paths for most of the past year. Jobs have been plentiful and wage growth is picking up, while mortgage rates are at their lowest level in nearly three years. But existing-home sales are down 4% this year compared with last, according to an analysis of National Association of Realtors data by Ted Jones, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Stewart Title Guaranty Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That divergence has stumped economists. But the growing strength of housing markets in the heartland suggests that strong economic fundamentals are helping, just not where prices have already grown faster than incomes for seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some of those [smaller] markets never saw a big boom coming out of the recession," said Ralph McLaughlin, deputy chief economist at CoreLogic Inc. "This may be a rising tide finally reaching some of these secondary markets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Danielle Parent, a Redfin agent in Cleveland, said she is seeing an influx of buyers from expensive coastal cities. Home prices in Cleveland rose nearly 12% in June compared with a year earlier, according to Redfin. That was driven by a shortage of inventory, as the number of homes for sale declined nearly 7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every time I think my buyers have just a minute to think about buying a house, if you get the price right, it immediately sells," Ms. Parent said. "It's still very, very competitive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julia Tiersky and Brian Tiersky spent about a decade in Seattle before deciding last month to move back to Cleveland, where Ms. Tiersky is from. The couple said lower housing and child-care costs sold them on the move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Hudson, a suburb of Cleveland where the couple decided to settle, they were surprised at how competitive the market was. "We'd find something we like and think we'll go out in a couple of weeks. By the time we did that, things would be off the market," Mr. Tiersky said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the couple found the right home, with a treehouse and proximity to Hudson's downtown, Ms. Tiersky took a redeye flight from Seattle and went straight from the airport to see it. They made an offer a few hours later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A long rally in hot spots like the Bay Area and Seattle has run out of gas. These markets are experiencing their first price declines in years, as homes linger on the market for weeks and would-be buyers balk at the still-expensive price tags.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unclear whether the sales growth in smaller U.S. cities will be enough to prop up the overall housing market, since slower growth or price declines in the biggest metro areas have weighed heavily on national home sales figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Midwestern markets have heated up so quickly they arenow experiencing some of the downsides of a hot market: shortages of inventory and rising prices that are blocking first-time buyers from entering the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anthony West, a Realtor in Kansas City, Mo., said the rise in competition and lack of inventory have prolonged the buying process for millennials and increased prices of lower-cost homes. He said younger buyers are having to make compromises, such as choosing an inconvenient location, forgoing the inspection period, or stretching themselves financially to pay for homes. "That's got me concerned for them down the road as to will they recoup those extra funds that they purchased this property for?" Mr. West said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michelle Gordon, a Realtor in Grand Rapids, Mich., said there is strong demand for entry-level homes, especially with lower mortgage rates. "We have some buyers coming out of the woodwork," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nathan Thornton, a 34-year-old general manager at a manufacturing company, and his wife, Clare Thornton, recently bought their third home in Grand Rapids since 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple, who have three boys under 7 years old, were desperate for a second bathroom. They looked for a year-and-a-half but kept losing out in bidding wars. "There were a lot of over-ask cash offers that were gobbling everything up," Mr. Thornton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, the couple found the perfect four-bedroom house with an attached garage and two bathrooms. Then they sold their own home in 24 hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had multiple offers coming in, but the first one was so good, we locked in right away," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>603 words</div><div>9 August 2019</div><div>10:43</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. mortgage rates have tumbled to their lowest level in nearly three years, but they are unlikely to provide much of a lift to the sluggish home-sales market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the rates could provide a modest boost to sales during the final months of this year, though few expect cheaper borrowing costs to reverse the course of a slowing market. Home sales have been weighed down by steep prices and limited starter-home inventory in many markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a bit of an added lease on life for this housing cycle. I don't think it's going to dramatically change anything," said Issi Romem, senior director of housing and urban economics at Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average rates for a 30-year mortgage hit their lowest level since November 2016, falling to 3.6% from 3.75% last week, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said on Thursday. Those mortgage rates have been falling for much of this year, after hitting nearly 5% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower rates have had an impact in refinancing. Applications for refinancing increased[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/homeowners-rush-to-refinance-thanks-to-falling-yields-11565277073] 12% in the week ending Aug. 7 compared with the prior week, but purchase applications declined 2% in the same period, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales are down about 4% so far this year, according to an analysis of National Association of Realtors data by Ted Jones, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Stewart Title Guaranty Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national slowdown in the housing market has been driven by high-price markets, especially in the West Coast markets like the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Seattle. Economists and real-estate agents said some of the factors driving the recent decline in borrowing costs—a weakening global economy, an intensifying trade battle with China, and new fears about a U.S. recession—are likely to have a bigger impact on the market than lower rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What's screwing everything up is the trade talks. When people have a lot of money and things are uncertain, they just kind of wait," said Jeff Barnett, a regional manager at Compass in the Bay Area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barnett said business in his office is down about 20% compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in more affordable markets, falling rates may have come too late to offer a significant boost to the housing market. About 40% of existing home sales take place from March through June each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're already far along in the housing season. I think people were making the decision whether to buy or not earlier in the year," said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents said they have not received many calls in recent weeks as rates fell because many people are on vacation or worried about getting their children back to school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It came during what I would consider our back-to-school season when buyers take a little bit of a pause," said Dakotah Smith, a Redfin market manager for Iowa and Nebraska.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strongest headwind facing the housing market at the moment is a shortage of starter homes, said Sam Khater, chief economist at Freddie Mac. Lower mortgage rates could make those homes slightly more affordable to buyers but don't help if they simply can't find homes in their price range to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The price of money is really low and it's declining but that's not what's holding back the market," Mr. Khater said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A two-story Atlanta building designed to produce more energy than it consumes is poised to open in early fall, a crucial test case of whether a large-scale environmentally-advanced project can achieve its goals in the heat and humidity of the Southeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Georgia Institute of Technology</span> and its partner the Kendeda Fund, a private grant foundation, are finishing up a 37,000 square-foot campus building. The building, which will have classrooms and teaching labs, was designed to be certified as a so-called "living building," meaning it will generate a surplus of electricity and that it can maintain a self-sufficient water supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building is far larger than other such projects in the Southeast. Its performance will be closely watched because creating a comfortable environment out of Atlanta's hot and humid air can be an energy-intensive task in conventionally designed structures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Share Your Thoughts</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How do you think this project will push eco-friendly developments in the future? Join the conversation below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The southeast is one of the most difficult climates to design for in the world because you have a need for heating in the winter time, cooling in the summertime, and you have humidity to deal with year round," said Dennis Creech, a fund adviser for the Kendeda Fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The living building program was designed by the Seattle-based International Living Future Institute. Many of the 23 other projects certified by the Institute have been in the more temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest or less humid Northeast. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The university hopes to prove that buildings can be constructed to some of the highest environmental standards, even in the Southeast's climate of weather extremes and heat and humidity. PHOTO: Melissa Golden for The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlanta building "takes away some of the naysayer argument of 'Oh, that works in Seattle or Germany but you can't do that here,'" said Shan Arora, director of the Kendeda Building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlanta building relies on robust insulation, triple-pane glass windows and automated external blinds to help maintain comfortable temperatures, keeping out hot humid air and preventing heat gain from the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A roof canopy of more than 900 solar panels will provide shade in addition to powering the building. Energy-efficient radiant cooling and heating in the flooring, ceiling fans and a separate dehumidifying system also reduce energy use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The solar roof doubles as a catchment system streaming rainwater into a 50,000-gallon cistern to be treated for use in sinks, water fountains, showers, and composting toilets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kendeda Fund donated $30 million to design and construct the building and support programs at the building, which will also have a design studio space, an auditorium, conference rooms, an apiary and a roof garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction costs for the building were about $503 a square foot, according to the team. Design and construction costs are still higher than that of conventional buildings, but prices for technologies such as solar panels have come down over the last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Costs also have declined because, as more of these structures have been built, consultants have gained experience and more vendors supplying products that comply with the requirements have emerged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are trying to get enough catalyst buildings in different climates and different locations that can be beacons to people," said Amanda Sturgeon, chief executive of the International Living Future Institute. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Ryan Dezember </div><div>688 words</div><div>3 August 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slump in home sales this spring has befuddled economists and bedeviled real-estate agents, given how low borrowing costs and unemployment have been. Big rental-home owners, on the other hand, are overjoyed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Invitation Homes Inc</span>., which owns more than 80,000 single-family houses, and <span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span>, with nearly 53,000, reported record occupancy and rents this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Invitation said that its same-home occupancy rate ticked up to 96.5%, and that rents on leases signed during the period were up 5.3% from a year earlier. Occupancy and rent growth for <span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span> were 96.5% and 4.7%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those are highs for both companies and better than what has been achieved by owners of apartments, which are also in demand but suffer somewhat from being overbuilt, said John Pawlowski, an analyst at the real-estate research firm <span class="companylink">Green Street Advisors</span>. "The rental market broadly is on very firm footing," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors are skittish about the nascent single-family rental sector's expenses. These include maintenance of tens of thousands of far-flung houses, as well as property taxes, which constitute roughly half of these companies' ongoing costs and have been increasing along with home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, though, demand for their family-size rentals in highly rated suburban school districts has been sufficient for the companies to be profitable. "While expenses remain a fly in the ointment, top line growth is coming in strong enough to keep the bottom line intact," <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> analysts wrote in a review of <span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span>'s results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a tepid reception in 2017, Invitation's stock has soared. Including dividends, it has returned 38% this year, even as <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group Inc</span>., the investment firm that financed Invitation's multibillion-dollar house hunt at the depths of the foreclosure crisis, has halved its stake by selling roughly $3 billion worth of Invitation shares into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span>, which has fewer homes but operates in more markets than Invitation, was established by the self-storage magnate B. Wayne Hughes and run by one of his former <span class="companylink">Public Storage</span> lieutenants. Its stock, which made its debut in 2013, has returned 23% in 2019. The S&amp;P 500 index has added about 20% in 2019, including dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both companies cater to relatively well-to-do families with school-age children. The average rent at Invitation is $1,800 a month. At <span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span>, it is $1,620. As such, they compete with not only each other but homeownership as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spring -- the prime leasing season for single-family-rental companies -- is when about 40% of home sales take place. Sales of existing homes fell 1.7% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 5.27 million, according to the National Association of Realtors. They declined year-over-year for a 16th straight month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Showings per available property at <span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span> were up 20% in the second quarter from a year earlier, and Invitation Chief Executive Dallas Tanner said the second quarter was the first in which buying a home wasn't the most common reason tenants gave for moving out of the company's homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lack of affordability is pushing would-be buyers to rental-home companies and helping to keep them there, particularly those who are seeking to purchase a home for the first time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers at <span class="companylink">John Burns Real Estate Consulting</span> recently estimated that even after 30-year mortgage rates fell from nearly 5% in November to below 4%, only 54% of Americans can afford to buy a house that is 20% below the median price in their area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For a renter, there aren't many other options if you have a family that's too big for an apartment and not a lot of money for a down payment," said Trevor Tetzlaff, one of the researchers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growth of U.S. home prices slowed again in May, as the housing market continues to moderate during what has been a weak year for sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales prices grew 3.4% for the year ending in May 2019, down from the 3.5% increase during the year ending in April, according to the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index. Prices have been decelerating on an annual basis for more than a year, the report said, though they continue to outpace the rate of inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That is the longest stretch of cooling price growth since the great recession. That's sort of the elephant in the room," said CoreLogic deputy chief economist Ralph McLaughlin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the nation's 20 largest cities, price gains were modest, growing 2.4% for the year ending in May. However, the data were highly variable. While prices grew 6.4% in Las Vegas, they declined 1.2% in Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the latest statistics indicate some housing markets remain resilient despite the broader softening trend, said Philip Murphy, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. He noted that seven of the largest U.S. cities saw larger than average gains. "For now, there is still substantial diversity in local trends," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McLaughlin expects national price deceleration to reverse course within the next one to three months, given historically low interest rates and a slight uptick in inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales volume of existing homes has declined for the last 16 months, falling 1.7% for the year ended in June, according to the National Association of Realtors. Although the current rate of price deceleration hasn't yet been enough to spark more sales, some analysts point to more rapidly falling prices in West Coast markets as another potential draw for new buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of those markets, Seattle has seen the biggest swing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sluggish May market made Seattle the first city to post a year-to-year price decline since 2012, Mr. McLaughlin said. He cited slowing job growth there and increasing inventory as contributing factors.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An investment group has agreed to pay $1.2 billion for a portfolio of 2,800 New York rental apartments with an investment strategy that, at first glance, appears to run counter to conventional real-estate wisdom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, real-estate investors have purchased thousands of rent-regulated New York rental apartments with hopes of converting them into market-rate units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the venture of L+M Development Partners Inc. and its partner Invesco Real Estate is moving in the opposite direction: It is planning to convert two-thirds of the units it is purchasing from <span class="companylink">Brookfield Asset Management</span> and Urban American into apartments that are affordable to tenants with limited incomes. All of them are now market rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal is one of the biggest examples of what may become an important tool in the city's effort to create more affordable rental apartments. L+M and Invesco have agreed to subject the apartments to rent regulations in exchange for deep property-tax breaks. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea is that the value of the tax break will make up for the lost rent from the 2,800 apartments in East Harlem and Roosevelt Island. L+M is investing in the properties through its workforce-housing fund, which is focusing on units that will stay near fully rented regardless of economic conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's defensive and more cycle-resistant than conventional executions where you are relying on market forces," said Eben Ellertson, a managing director at L+M.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar strategies are being pursued by a small but growing group of other investors. In another large deal that closed in June, Camber Property Group and Belveron Partners paid $77 million to buy Highbridge House, a 400-unit high rise in the Bronx. That group is planning to rent all its units to tenants with low and moderate incomes in exchange for lower taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deals come when the city is facing an acute lack of affordable housing. Skyrocketing rents helped housing advocates win an unprecedented victory in Albany earlier this year as the state legislature added a range of obstacles preventing landlords from raising rents or freeing apartments from rent regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this atmosphere, city officials and investors have dusted off a 1960s-era city tax-exemption program known as Article XI. The provision allows the city to negotiate individual deals with property owners, where the city seeks to balance the cost of lost tax revenue with the benefit of rents set at no more than 30% of median income for renter households who meet specific income limits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing advocates and city officials estimate that thousands of affordable units could be created through the program. Landlords have removed more than 100,000 units from city rent regulations over the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've seen an increase of these [Article XI] agreements since the start of the mayor's housing plan," said Matthew Creegan, a spokesman for the <span class="companylink">New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Article XI isn't a panacea. The program is complex and requires negotiations between owners and the city and approval by the city council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City records show the taxes on just three of the four L+M projects for which figures are available would have totaled $11.2 million this year. They will now pay a fraction of that, but the exact figure wasn't disclosed. The city put the cost of the lost tax revenue at $235 million over the next 40 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The venture of L+M and Invesco beat out offers from investors including sovereign-wealth funds from Asia and the Middle East and big foreign and domestic pension funds, said Adam Spies, co-head of the <span class="companylink">Cushman &amp; Wakefield</span> team representing the sellers.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Christina Rexrode </div><div>982 words</div><div>29 July 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alex Ruiz, 29 years old, and his wife, Stephanie Johnson, have steady jobs, are setting aside money for retirement and are slowly paying down their student debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet buying a house seems out of reach for at least another decade. Home values in Asheville, N.C., where they live, are up some 70% over the past seven years. Their student-loan payments and rising rent have made it difficult to save for a down payment, and the houses that go on the market get snapped up right away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Day to day we're OK generally," said Mr. Ruiz, a case manager at a government-funded agency. "But the depressing part is when we take a hard look at the possibility of our future."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For generations, the wealth of U.S. households was built on the foundation of homeownership. That is changing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeownership rates for younger Americans have fallen sharply over the past decade. The median age of a home buyer is 46, the oldest since the National Association of Realtors began keeping records in 1981. Economists, policy makers and mortgage lenders expect the trend to extend to younger generations. The decline illustrates what for many Americans is the real legacy of the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who came of age in the crisis and its immediate aftermath had no bargaining power when they entered the job market, crimping their earnings ever since. They started adulthood when the housing market was crashing and watched as banks foreclosed on their parents -- and decided they weren't interested in tying their fortunes to a piece of property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, as memories of the crisis fade, they want to buy homes but are finding themselves priced out of the market. Home prices have risen across the board but most steeply among the starter homes first-time buyers can afford, as developers focus on high-end properties where profit margins are higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of lower-priced homes rose by 64% from early 2012 to late 2018, according to mortgage-data tracker <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, while the price of higher-end homes rose just 40%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effects are already reverberating through the economy. More adults in their 20s and 30s are living with their parents, according to census data, which could make them unwilling or unable to move cities for better jobs. The possibility of rent increases could make them less willing to spend, which some economists believe has already contributed to the economy's slow postcrisis growth. Some young adults said their inability to buy a home had made them rethink having children, which could exacerbate the challenges created by America's aging population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Lower homeownership for young adults means lower economic growth," said Sam Khater, chief economist of mortgage-finance giant Freddie Mac. "That's it in a nutshell."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeownership rates for young people are near their lowest levels in more than three decades of record-keeping. About 40% of young adults, ages 25 to 34, were homeowners in 2018, according to federal data analyzed by <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That is down from about 48% in 2001. Some economists calculate the decline is actually even steeper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crux of the problem: Home prices have outpaced wage gains. From roughly the end of 2000 to the end of 2017, median home prices rose 21% after adjusting for inflation, while median household income rose 2%, according to federal and industry data analyzed by <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the drop in homeownership is a matter of preference. The financial crisis made today's young adults averse to debt and risk, lenders said. That means they might be willing to spend on daily luxuries but not to tie up the bulk of their money in a mortgage. Millennials aren't making up for lost home equity in other investments. The median net worth for young families plunged by nearly a third from 2001 to 2016 after adjusting for inflation, according to the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if millennials soon start buying homes en masse, as some banks and mortgage lenders predict, there are consequences to buying late. A recent report by the Urban Institute examined homeowners who turned 60 or 61 between 2003 and 2015. Those who bought their first home between ages 25 and 34 had median housing wealth of about $149,000. Those who waited until ages 35 to 44 had half that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effects of not buying, or buying late, should become more clear as millennials enter new stages of life. The median family net worth of homeowners is more than $230,000, according to the Fed, compared with $5,000 for renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without home equity, people are less able to weather job losses or unexpected medical expenses, and less able to start small businesses. Baby boomers could find that when they want to downsize, there are fewer buyers because younger adults never built up equity in a first home. And decades from now, millennials might have to keep working well into retirement age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Jobs are plentiful, the economy seems good, and lenders are going to look at this and say, 'Everything's great,'" said Brad Blackwell, who recently retired as head of housing policy at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span>. "But they should take the long view."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elysse Lane, 32, and her husband finished business school in 2016 and wanted to live in the San Francisco area, where she had a job offer and family. They moved to Austin, Texas, instead, in large part because buying a home in California seemed impossible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the market in Austin is crowded too. They have put offers on three homes but lost to other bidders. One small comfort: They don't really feel out of place. Many of their friends are in similar situations.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Will Parker </div><div>489 words</div><div>26 July 2019</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. homeownership rate fell for a second straight quarter, as high prices and limited starter-home inventory are steering more households toward renting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate stood at 64.1% for months April to June, a slight decline from 64.2% in the first quarter and down from 64.3% one year ago, according to data from the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>. The second quarter marked the first time the homeownership rate fell on an annual basis since 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before this year, homeownership had been ticking higher since the start of 2017 and was approaching its historic average of around 65%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 585,000 new homeowners in the quarter, compared with the nearly 600,000 new rental households during the period. The vacancy rate for rental apartments fell to 6.8% from 7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The short-term struggle is that to increase the homeownership rate, you typically need to move someone from renter to owner," said Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American Financial Corporation. "But is there something they can afford to buy?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The soft homeownership numbers are the latest sign that low mortgage rates and low unemployment are failing to lure enough buyers to the market. It is a phenomenon that has puzzled economists, and some think that it is only a matter of time until cheap borrowing costs boost homeownership and sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One recent bright spot was new-home sales in June, which increased 7% from the prior month. But previously owned homes account for the vast majority of sales, and weaker sales of existing homes last month brought a slow spring selling season to a disappointing end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners are staying in their homes much longer than they were in the past, according to a <span class="companylink">First American Financial Corporation</span> data analysis -- another factor in the lack of inventory available to first-time home buyers. As of May, the average homeowner tenure was 11.3 years. Five years ago, that average was about 9 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though mortgage interest rates are relatively low, they have been even lower at various points during the past five years, making those buyers who are locked into lower rates less willing to consider moving elsewhere, Mr. Fleming said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fleming and other analysts say low inventory of homes affordable to first-time buyers is keeping the homeownership in check.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Historically the ratio has been 2-to-1 homeowners to renters in household formation," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quarterly homeownership data are volatile and several quarters of consistent movement are typically needed to indicate trends. For example, although millennials have a lower rate of ownership than other generations, the rate of ownership for people under 35 actually rose 1% last quarter, though it has remained between 34% and 37% for the past five years.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Home-buyers bought more new homes in June, a bright spot in the beleaguered housing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes increased 7% from the prior month [https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrs/index.html?mod=article_inline] to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 646,000 in June, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. The increase follows two straight months of declines. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal have expected a sales pace of 659,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes for sale in June would last 6.3 months at the current pace. That's up from 6 months a year earlier. The median sales price of a new home in June was $310,400, roughly the same as a year ago, when the median sales price was $310,500. From a year ago, new home sales were up 4.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales data can be volatile and subject to revisions. The June increase came with a margin of error of plus or minus 15.2 percentage points. Sales in May were revised down to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 604,000 from an initial estimate of 626,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the volatility, "the trend has picked up so far this year," said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics in a note to clients. So far this year, the annualized rate of sales is averaging 652,000, he said, up from a rate of 615,000 for all of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Mezger, president and chief executive of Los Angeles-based home builder KB Home, said the company is selling more than five homes on average each month in new-home developments it builds. He attributes the strong sales to KB's focus on the starter home end of the market, while the high end has been weaker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In every market there is a price point at which things slow. Strategically we don't get up into that price point," Mr. Mezger said. "As first time buyer demand has come back, it's right in the sweet spot for us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales are a relatively narrow slice of all U.S. home sales. About 90% of homes purchased were previously owned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales are moving in the opposite direction. Sales in that market fell 1.7% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 5.27 million, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low unemployment and rising wages have put more households in a position to buy. At the same time, mortgage rates have been held down by the prospect of a cut in interest rates next week by the Federal Reserve. As of last week, the average rate for a 30-year mortgage was about 3.8%, down from 4.5% a year ago, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report showed new home sales falling in the Northeast and the Midwest, where they fell to the lowest level since September 2015. But sales rose strongly in the West in June after slumping in May. Sales in the South were roughly on par with the previous month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. unemployment rate in June was 3.7%, near a 50-year low. A July 24 Page One article about home sales incorrectly said the rate was at a 50-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ August 2, 2019)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales slumped in June as home prices for major West Coast cities declined for the first time since 2012, ending the spring selling season with a thud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents said lower asking prices could attract more buyers, but home values in the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Seattle have roughly doubled over the past seven years. That means prices may have to retreat further before buyers do more than look, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices have dropped in Silicon Valley and sellers just aren't used to the concept that [prices] can go down," said Ken DeLeon, founder of DeLeon Realty in Palo Alto, Calif. "There's just this malaise buyers had of, 'I feel like it's gonna drop further.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales fell 1.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 5.27 million, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday. Sales declined 2.2% compared with a year earlier, marking the 16th consecutive month of annual declines in sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spring selling season is crucial because about 40% of the year's sales take place in March through June. Falling sales during most of this period have puzzled economists. They struggle to explain why the housing market has remained soft while the rest of the economy has been booming. Borrowing rates have fallen to their lowest levels in two years, wages are rising and unemployment is at a 50-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It doesn't make economic sense," said Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of momentum during the spring could now mean a prolonged slowdown in the market, some economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The demand this cycle is certainly showing signs that perhaps it's reached its full capacity," said Ralph McLaughlin, deputy chief economist at real-estate data provider <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there was some reason for optimism in the June report. While sales declined in the South and the West, they actually rose slightly in the Midwest and Northeast, according to the <span class="companylink">NAR</span>. Some economists expect lower mortgage rates will lure more buyers, and additional inventory could help stabilize the market that has been pinched by limited supply and high prices in many metro areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think by the end of the year, total home sales, both new and existing, will probably not be much different than where they were last year," said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of previously owned homes account for about 90% of U.S. home buying. The Commerce Department releases June new-home sales data on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders have turned more cautious in recent weeks. Ryan Marshall, chief executive of PulteGroup Inc., an Atlanta-based builder, said on a Tuesday earnings call that the company's sales figures for the rest of the year would likely be softer than analysts expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, new-home sales have disappointed this year, falling 3.7% in May compared with the year prior, according to the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A slump in coastal markets also shows little sign of reversing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a home fell in San Jose, Seattle and Los Angeles in June, compared with a year earlier, according to real-estate brokerage Redfin. For San Jose, that was the seventh month of annual price declines. The slowdown in the West Coast markets spans all price points, including starter homes, which had been the tightest segment of the market. In San Jose, inventory for homes in the bottom-third price tier nearly doubled in June compared with a year earlier, while prices dropped 3.8%, according to Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michelle Englert, a Bay Area real-estate agent, hosted an open house in a San Jose condo on June 21. The asking price was $770,000, well below what other condos in the complex were priced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We priced this aggressively low because there are two other units in this building that have been sitting for 30 plus days," said Ms. Englert, who has worked in the area for nearly 20 years. "We just wanted to shotgun sale it and see what happens."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Englert said she has noticed buyer fatigue over the past year and thinks the area might be tapped out. "People are looking but not pulling triggers," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coastal housing markets were the first to rebound from the housing bust because of an influx of young, affluent professionals and a shortage of housing, especially at prices affordable to first-time buyers. But after years of increases, prices in those markets have overshot what even many well-off buyers can afford, and agents said they see many buyers dropping out of the market or pausing their searches. The 2017 overhaul of the federal tax code that capped the deduction for state and local taxes at $10,000 and reduced the limit for the mortgage-interest deduction has also damped demand for more expensive homes in high-tax states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Portland, Ore., 30-year-old Alisa Rudnick and her fiance have been searching for their first home since January, hoping to settle somewhere before September. They were targeting a home for less than $500,000, but after being outbid at more than asking price on four occasions, they have suspended their search. "We put our search on hold to focus on the wedding," Ms. Rudnick said. "We're going to try again in the off cycle."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While price declines are concentrated on the West Coast, other costly markets such as New York, Boston and the Denver area are also weakening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denver saw the second-largest increase in starter homes for sale in June, according to Redfin, at nearly 63%. "We are entering a buyer's market hard," said Steve deGuzman, a broker at REX Homes in Denver. "Values accelerated so quickly we don't have a way for the first-time buyer to enter the market."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After decades of solid economic growth that has transformed Poland, Warsaw is experiencing a surge in luxury housing, pushing prices up 20% last year in the high-end sector and causing a dramatic change to the city's skyline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Poland's geographical position at Europe's crossroads made it a battlefield for centuries, but now places it as an ideal transportation and diverse manufacturing hub. Locals benefiting from the robust economy, especially in the country's expanding service industry, are buying up prime properties in and around the capital, resulting in a conspicuous new crop of residential towers and low-rise refurbishments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices in the capital and financial center jumped 6.7% overall in 2018, according the Global Residential Cities Index, compiled by the U.K.'s Knight Frank. That figure places Warsaw ahead of American markets such as Boston and Seattle, and European stalwarts like Munich and Dublin. But the number was surpassed by the surge in the luxury segment, which begins at about $610 a square foot, says Kazimierz Kirejczyk, vice president of Warsaw's <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, an analyst of Poland's residential real-estate trends. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Konstancin-Jeziorna, originally a spa destination about 15 miles south of the city, is home to the wealthiest Poles, says Mr. Kirejczyk. Buyers there are drawn to large villas and <span class="companylink">big lots</span>. A local mansion built in 2004 is on the market for $3 million. The seven-bedroom, 13,000-square-foot home is on a wooded, ¾-acre lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other sought-after areas include Mokotow, an embassy district just south of the commercial heart of Warsaw, where a 3,000-square-foot, 1960s semidetached house, with four bedrooms and three bathrooms, is listed for $1.53 million, following a 2015 refurbishment. The area is known for its low-rise apartment buildings and single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the city center, however, luxury living is going high-rise, including projects tied to prominent international architects. Zlota 44, a 54-story residential skyscraper designed by Polish-American architect Daniel Libeskind and completed in 2017, has given the skyline a jagged emblem. Residents are offered lavish in-house amenities, including a wine-tasting room and a quartz-lined, 80-foot pool. The building's 6,500-square-foot triplex penthouse is on the market for $10.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A short walk away, the 5-year-old, 44-story Cosmopolitan tower, designed by Chicago-based German-American architect Helmut Jahn, has a combination indoor-outdoor gym and a cinema room with a golf simulator. A four-bedroom 40th-floor unit, measuring 1,700 square feet, is on the market for $1.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both complexes have concierge service, a new must-have for high-end buildings in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most buzzed-about luxury development currently under construction in Warsaw is Foksal 13/15, a 19th-century, low-rise apartment complex that survived the city's near-total destruction during World War II. A 5,000-square-foot duplex, with a roof terrace and space for seven bedrooms, sold in 2017 for $4.6 million. The project is scheduled for completion later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeroen van der Toolen, managing director of the Polish subsidiary of Ghelamco—the Belgian-based real-estate company behind Foksal and a leading developer of commercial projects in Warsaw—says the vast majority of buyers in the complex are Poles already residing in the city, as well as ex-patriate Poles working abroad who plan to use their new apartments as pieds-à-terre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warsaw was devastated during World War II, and the city has been rebuilding since. Older residents still recall the consumer shortages of the 1980s, with long lines snaking around barren grocery stores. Today, along with the latest-style high-rises, Warsaw has become a culinary destination. It is home to innovative Michelin-star chef Wojciech Modest Amaro, an alumnus of Spain's celebrated El Bulli restaurant. At Atelier Amaro, he features artisanal Polish vodkas and wines from boutique Polish vineyards in his multicourse, $195 menus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Amaro, now 47, recently bought his own home in Wilanow, a villa enclave between Mokotow and Konstancin-Jeziorna, which he says allows him to live in the city but with a countryside feel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Poland has begun its first true golden age," says economist Marcin Piatkowski, author of "Europe's Growth Champion: Insights from the Economic rise of Poland."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Piatkowski says Poland's per capita GDP has nearly tripled since 1990, putting it ahead of all other postcommunist states and members of the eurozone. He compares the boomtown feeling in Warsaw with Beijing, where he is currently working for the <span class="companylink">World Bank</span>. Mr. Piatkowski, 43, also is looking for a Warsaw pied-à-terre, preferably a high-rise with river views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many high-end buyers opt for the towers and the renovations in the city center, says Mr. Kirejczyk, "If you have a lot of money, you don't buy, you build."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011, Peter Kusmierkiewicz-Tourel, a Warsaw entrepreneur, and his wife, U.S.-born consultant Marielle Kusmierkiewicz-Tourel, bought a 2/3-acre lot in Izbica, a village about a 40-minute drive north of Warsaw. The couple, now 41 and 32, respectively, built a Neo-Modernist villa as a vacation home, working with prizewinning architect Robert Konieczny. They divide their time between a Warsaw duplex, an apartment in Tel Aviv and their two-story Izbica home, which overlooks the Narew, a tributary of the Vistula River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the 3,200-square-foot, four-bedroom, four-bathroom villa, completed in 2014, is for sale for $2 million. The open-plan home has a glass-enclosed ground floor, with a sauna that leads to a terrace with an outdoor shower. The property comes with private river access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two plan to stay in the same area, where the broad, winding Narew is reminiscent of a lake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though once remote, Izbica is turning into a Warsaw suburb. The couple expect offers from people who work full- or part-time in the capital and will use the home as a primary residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1980s, Warsaw residents typically had two stark choices: stay put in a collapsing society or try their luck abroad. In today's Warsaw, says Mr. Amaro, the chef, you can choose what you want. "For us," he says, "luxury means having options."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. unemployment rate in June was 3.7%, near a 50-year low. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the rate was at a 50-year low. (Aug. 1, 2019)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales slumped in June as home prices for major West Coast cities declined for the first time since 2012, ending the spring selling season with a thud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents said lower asking prices could eventually attract more buyers, but home values in the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Seattle have roughly doubled over the past seven years. That means prices may have to retreat further before buyers do more than look, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices have dropped in Silicon Valley and sellers just aren't used to the concept that [prices] can go down," said Ken DeLeon, founder of DeLeon Realty in Palo Alto, Calif. "There's just this malaise buyers had of, ‘I feel like it's gonna drop further.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales fell 1.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 5.27 million, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday. Sales declined 2.2% compared with a year earlier, marking the 16th consecutive month of annual declines in sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spring selling season is crucial because about 40% of the year's sales take place in March through June. Falling sales during most of this period have puzzled economists. They struggle to explain why the housing market has remained soft while the rest of the economy has been booming. Borrowing rates have fallen to their lowest levels [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/lower-rates-have-a-downside-for-banks-11563796800] in two years, wages are rising and unemployment is near a 50-year low [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-job-creation-bounced-back-in-june-11562330095?mod=article_inline].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It doesn't make economic sense," said Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of momentum during the spring could now mean a prolonged slowdown in the market, some economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The demand this cycle is certainly showing signs that perhaps it's reached its full capacity," said Ralph McLaughlin, deputy chief economist at real-estate data provider <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there was some reason for optimism in the June report. While sales declined in the South and the West, they actually rose slightly in the Midwest and Northeast, according to the NAR. Some economists expect lower mortgage rates will eventually lure more buyers, and additional inventory could help stabilize the market that has been pinched by limited supply and high prices in many metro areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think by the end of the year, total home sales, both new and existing, will probably not be much different than where they were last year," said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of previously owned homes account for about 90% of U.S. home buying. The Commerce Department releases June new-home sales data on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders have turned more cautious in recent weeks. Ryan Marshall, chief executive of PulteGroup Inc., an Atlanta-based builder, said on a Tuesday earnings call that the company's sales figures for the rest of the year would likely be softer than analysts expected. Pulte shares were down more than 7% in Tuesday trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, new-home sales have disappointed this year, falling 3.7% in May compared with the year prior, according to the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A deepening slump in expensive coastal markets also shows little sign of reversing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a home fell in San Jose, Seattle and Los Angeles in June, compared with a year earlier, according to real-estate brokerage Redfin. For San Jose, that was the seventh month of annual price declines. The slowdown in the West Coast marketsnow spans all price points, including starter homes, which had been the tightest segment of the market. In San Jose, inventory for homes in the bottom-third price tier nearly doubled in June compared with a year earlier, while prices dropped 3.8%, according to Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michelle Englert, a Bay Area real-estate agent, hosted an open house in a San Jose condo on June 21. The asking price was $770,000, well below what other condos in the complex were priced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We priced this aggressively low because there are two other units in this building that have been sitting for 30 plus days," said Ms. Englert, who has worked in the area for nearly 20 years. "We just wanted to shotgun sale it and see what happens."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Englert said she has noticed buyer fatigue over the past year and thinks the area might be tapped out. "People are looking but not pulling triggers," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coastal housing markets were the first to rebound from the housing bust because of an influx of young, affluent professionals and a shortage of housing, especially at prices affordable to first-time buyers. But after years of double-digit increases, prices in those markets have overshot what even many well-off young buyers can afford, and agents said they see many buyers dropping out of the market or pausing their searches. The 2017 overhaul of the federal tax code that capped the deduction for state and local taxes at $10,000 and reduced the limit for the mortgage-interest deduction has also damped demand for more expensive homes in high-tax states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Portland, Ore., 30-year-old Alisa Rudnick and her fiancé have been searching for their first home since January, hoping to settle somewhere before their September wedding. They were targeting a home for less than $500,000 and in the city, but after being outbid at more than asking price on four separate occasions, they have suspended their search. "We put our search on hold to focus on the wedding," Ms. Rudnick said. "We're going to try again in the off cycle."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While price declines are concentrated on the West Coast, other costly markets such as New York, Boston and the Denver area are also weakening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denver saw the second-largest increase in starter homes for sale in June, according to Redfin, at nearly 63%. "We are entering a buyer's market hard," said Steve deGuzman, a broker at REX Homes in Denver. "Values accelerated so quickly we don't have a way for the first-time buyer to enter the market."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday: The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> releases existing-home sales data for June. Sales of previously owned homes rose in May, a sign that falling mortgage rates could be nudging the housing market toward a more modest performance after months of sluggishness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday: The Commerce Department releases new-home sales figures for June. Purchases of newly built single-family homes decreased 7.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 626,000 in May, the slowest pace of sales since December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The eurozone will see purchasing managers' manufacturing data for July. Manufacturing activity in Europe contracted in June, wrapping up the weakest quarter for the goods-producing sector in six years, <span class="companylink">IHS Markit</span> data showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday: The Commerce Department releases June durable-goods data. In May, overall orders for durable goods -- manufactured products intended to last at least three years -- fell 1.3% from the prior month. Meanwhile, an underlying business-investment gauge -- new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- increased 0.4% from April. The June data on durable goods will offer the latest glimpse of whether manufacturing is stabilizing after a few wobbly months earlier in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday: The Commerce Department releases second-quarter gross domestic product data. In the first quarter, the economy grew at a 3.1% seasonally adjusted annual rate. The economy likely grew at a slower pace in the April through June period as trade tensions prompted companies to rein in investment. The report also will signal how resilient American consumers remained during a period of trade tensions and slowing global growth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower interest rates were supposed to breathe new life into the housing market. But so far there are few signs of a real-estate revival.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks in large part to the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s dovish turn this year, mortgages have rarely been so cheap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of last week, the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.75%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, down from 4.73% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throw in an unemployment rate at nearly a 50-year low and improving household balance sheets and it appears the housing market should still have plenty of fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But housing doesn't look so hot. The latest evidence of that came Wednesday as the Commerce Department reported that construction was started on an annualized 1.25 million new homes last month, fewer than the 1.27 million economists expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family housing starts, which better capture the trend in construction than the volatile overall figure, came to an annualized 847,000, which was down 1% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential building permits, a measure of the pipeline for new construction, also came in below expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent home-sales figures also have been on the weak side. Sales of previously owned homes were 1.1% below their year-earlier level in May, while new-home sales declined by 3.7% over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last month, shares of <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>, the country's second-largest home builder, fell sharply after it gave a disappointing outlook on new home orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a variety of forces that might be muting the effect of lower mortgage rates on the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would-be buyers have to qualify for a mortgage before they get one, for example, and lending standards remain far more stringent than they were before the financial crisis. Nor do Americans view homes as such a good investment as they used to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the issue of affordability: Home-price gains have moderated, but as of May prices were still up 3.6% from a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, outpacing the 3.1% average increase in hourly earnings over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the 2017 tax overhaul effectively raised the costs of homeownership for many buyers, particularly in high-tax states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps it is just a matter of time before lower rates start to work their magic. But given the overall backdrop -- low rates, strong hiring, soaring stock prices -- it seems as if the housing market ought to be doing a whole lot better than it is already. One or two Fed rate cuts are unlikely to make a big difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This might be about as good as it gets.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building in the U.S. declined in June, a fresh sign of weakness in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Housing starts [http://www.census.gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf], a measure of new-home construction, fell 0.9% in June from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.253 million, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential building permits, which can signal how much construction is in the pipeline, dropped 6.1% from May to an annual pace of 1.220 million. That was the biggest monthly drop since March 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Lower mortgage rates are not spurring the home building industry to increase construction, as lack of skilled workers, cheaper material costs and land zoned for building continue to hamstring production," said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 0.7% decrease for starts and a 0.3% decrease for permits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-starts data are volatile from month to month and can be subject to large revisions. June's 0.9% decline for starts came with a margin of error of 7.9 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts were up 6.2% from June last year. Building permits were down 6.6% from June 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall housing sector has struggled with high prices and low inventory, even with a strong labor market, low borrowing costs and rising incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage eased further in June to 3.73% in the final week of the month, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the lowest rate since late 2016.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hispanics are experiencing the largest homeownership gains of any ethnic group in the U.S., a turnaround for the population hardest hit by the housing bust that could help buoy the market for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homeownership rate for Hispanics has increased more during the past several years than any race or ethnic group, including whites. The rate, which hit a 50-year low in 2015, has risen 3.3 percentage points since then, according to <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span> data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall U.S. homeownership rate bottomed in the second quarter of 2016 and has grown 1.3 percentage points since then. For blacks, the homeownership rate has fallen to its lowest level on record in the first quarter of this year. This marks the first time in more than two decades that Hispanics and blacks, the two largest racial or ethnic minorities in the U.S., are no longer following the same path when it comes to owning homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Hispanics make up 18% of the U.S. population, the group accounted for nearly 63% of new U.S. homeowner gains over the past decade, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals</span>. New homeowners include people buying first homes and those coming back into the market after a foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group's homeownership has risen alongside gains in income and education and a growing familiarity with the U.S. mortgage market. The Latin community also has a large millennial population entering the age of homeownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hispanic home buying stretched from towns in Southern California to rural Texas and suburban Minneapolis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market would look very different today if it weren't for a tidal wave of Latino home buyers," said Gary Acosta, NAHREP's co-founder and chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minorities bore the brunt of the 2008 housing bust and their return to homeownership has been mixed. Now, a growing population of young Latinos increasingly eager to buy homes offers fresh hope to a slowing housing market, where sales of existing homes have fallen on an annual basis for the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That slowdown has been driven, however, by a lack of starter homes and prices that have risen out of reach of many young buyers in major cities -- challenges that have hit the Hispanic community, which is concentrated in many of these places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Down payments can also be a barrier to minority communities. A recent study by the Urban Institute found that 4.6 million Hispanic millennials earn enough to afford a home in their area but are blocked by a lack of down payment and inventory for sale. The Hispanic homeownership rate remains at 47.4%, well below the rate for non-Hispanic whites, which was over 73% in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local and national lenders have courted a Hispanic clientele, who represent an appealing growth market as overall loan volume has slowed. Lenders have added Spanish-speaking loan officers and devoted additional resources to underwriting loans to borrowers who are self-employed or where multiple generations in a family are buying a home together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAHREP also said the median age in the Hispanic community is just under 29, compared with the median age for the U.S. overall of nearly 38 years old. That means Latinos are more weighted toward the age of first-time home buyers, who historically in the US. have been in their early 30s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason Madiedo, chief executive of Las Vegas-based Alterra Home Loans, said 80% of his company's loans are to Hispanic buyers and 70% are to first-time buyers who are fearful that if they don't buy a home now they won't ever be able to afford one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The FOMO -- the fear of missing out -- has sort of set in," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eyra Colindres, a 30-year-old Starbucks manager, began looking for a home last year after her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. Ms. Colindres, who came to the Los Angeles area from Mexico when she was 5 years old, wanted to care for her parents by purchasing a home where they could live together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Her biggest stress factor was how is she going to stay here," Ms. Colindres said of her mother.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through a friend, Ms. Colindres met a loan officer at mortgage lender New American Funding. The loan officer helped her repair her credit so that she could get approved for a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September 2018, she closed on a $235,000 two-bedroom in San Bernardino, Calif. She surprised her mother with the purchase, and they all moved in together. "It took her about a week to stop crying," Ms. Colindres said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hispanics and blacks saw significant gains in homeownership during the housing bubble, aided by lenders that targeted minority buyers with risky loans that eventually led to wide-scale foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hispanic homeownership rate hit a high of more than 50%, before plummeting 6 percentage points over the next eight years, according to census data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses in Hispanic communities were 2.5 times as likely to be foreclosed upon as homes in white communities between 2007 and 2015 while homes in black communities were twice as likely to be foreclosed on, according to an analysis by Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Artemisa Boston, a Realtor in Minneapolis, often has to reassure buyers that most mortgages nowadays have payments that are fixed for 30 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many come from countries where credit and mortgages aren't available so they are used to buying homes in cash. Ms. Boston will sometimes tell buyers to come back when they have been in the same job for two years so they can qualify for a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hispanic borrowers took out 9.4% of mortgages in the U.S. last year, versus 5.8% at their recent low point in 2010, according to ComplianceTech's LendingPatterns.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eva Angelina Romero, a real-estate agent in Nashville, Tenn., said that more small lenders are offering programs geared to Hispanic buyers. One uses a tax identification number instead of a Social Security number, which a buyer wouldn't have if undocumented. She said that while most of her clients used to be non-Hispanic, now 80% are Latino.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Mortgage companies are looking at that segment even more so now than before because refinances are not as plentiful [and saying] this is an opportunity we can no longer wait on," said Alterra Home Loans' Mr. Madiedo.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blacks Fall Behind</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Homeownership</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Hispanic homeownership rate is on the rise, the black homeownership rate has fallen 8.6 percentage points since its peak in 2004, hitting its lowest level on record in the first quarter of this year, according to census data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say black communities have struggled to recover financially since the housing crisis, which has kept homeownership out of reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decadeslong legacy of housing segregation has also made many would-be black buyers wary of returning to the market after losing their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can see that discrimination is still there, although it has changed its form," said Michela Zonta, a senior policy analyst at the <span class="companylink">Center for American Progress</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study by Ms. Zonta released on Monday also found that higher-income black homeowners are more likely to buy homes in heavily minority neighborhoods that have failed to benefit from the rise in home prices since the foreclosure crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes in neighborhoods with a high concentration of white borrowers on average have seen their homes appreciate 3% from 2006 through 2017, according to the study. However, homes in neighborhoods with a concentration of black borrowers on average are worth 6% less than they were in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-income black borrowers have concentrated in neighborhoods where homes have lost 2% of their value, compared with white borrowers, who have concentrated in neighborhoods where homes have appreciated 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Zonta said the findings underscore the need to step up enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, which prevents mortgage brokers and real-estate agents from steering clients to predominantly minority areas.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-builder shares soared during the first half of 2019 with help from falling interest rates, but some analysts warn that slowing home sales and a tight labor market could weigh on these companies in the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P Homebuilders Select Industry index is up 28.8% year to date, making it one of the top-performing sectors and outpacing the S&amp;P 500 stock index's 18.7% return over that period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With interest rates easing, borrowing costs have been falling sharply. The 30-year mortgage rate has slid to 3.75%, its lowest level in more than two years. That favorable backdrop for home buyers has helped lift home-builder sentiment and led analysts to upgrade some companies. Financial-services firm Wedbush, for example, upgraded <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., the largest U.S. home builder last month, citing lower rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boon of low rates "has been apparent in the strong mortgage demand data and will in all-likelihood be reflected in improving home sales data this summer," said Alex Pettee, president and director of research at investment advisory Hoya Capital Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry has also benefited from falling lumber prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But builder confidence, as measured monthly by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>, declined from May to June. The confidence rating is now lower than it was at the same time last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders cited increased construction costs overall, a labor shortage and trade tension with China, a source of materials. During an earnings call on June 25, a <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> executive cited tariffs on Chinese goods, specifically, as an operating headwind. The stock price fell 6.2% that day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts also pointed to disappointing recent sales figures during what is typically the most robust time of year. New home sales fell 7.8% between April and May, dropping nearly 36% on the West Coast. Sales of existing homes rose last month, but remained below 2018 levels. Single-family housing starts also fell more than 6% in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spring selling season accounts for more than 40% of annual sales revenue for many builders, and with that period now over, further earnings declines will likely follow, said Kenneth Leon, global director of industry and equity research at CFRA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Expectations are going to be less and that will factor into perhaps lower revenue and lower earnings estimates," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the challenge for builders is meeting demand at the lower end of the market, where new construction -- which sells at a premium to existing homes -- has to compete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The biggest difficulty of housing is those entry-level starter homes," said Raymond James analyst Buck Horne. "We're building about 200,000 houses under $250,000 a year. That number used to be 700,000."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales at <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> decreased in the second quarter compared with the year prior. But the company saw a 15% increase in new orders, increasing market share in markets such as Denver and Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some home builders are also tapping into the leasing market, building single-family homes for rent. They hope this could meet the increasing demand from people struggling to buy. ERC Homebuilders, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> and <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. have launched or expanded their build-to-rent offerings in the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Build-to-rent "only accounts for about 6% of total housing starts," Mr. Pettee said. "But you could easily see that go to 10 or 12% in the next five years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>., another publicly traded builder, said in April that it had increased its supply of homes targeted toward first-time buyers.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for rental apartments reached a five-year high this spring, spurred by new household formation and lagging home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of new apartment move-ins in the second quarter of 2019 increased 11% over the same period last year, according to a national report from real-estate analytics firm <span class="companylink">RealPage</span>. The demand surge drove the national occupancy rate to 95.8%, compared with 95.4% at the end of the second quarter of 2018, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">RealPage</span>'s chief economist, Greg Willett, attributed the increase in the second quarter partly to economic uncertainty that slowed the market in the first quarter. "This is catch-up," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand grew particularly in Chicago and Houston. Move-ins in those markets outpaced apartment construction by nearly 3 to 1, <span class="companylink">RealPage</span> data showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly rental prices nationwide shot up 3% from the second quarter of 2018 to the same period this year. Many small metros saw bigger increases. Rents rose 7.4% in Wilmington, N.C., and 6.4% in Huntsville, Ala., according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although apartment construction is near the highest it has been in 30 years, much of that new supply is targeting higher earners, Mr. Willett said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With little new affordable supply, the market for lower-cost rentals is much tighter. Most of the new supply "doesn't really help the consumer in [lower-end] housing where it's already full," said Mr. Willett.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The volume of existing-home sales on an annualized basis has fallen for 15 straight months. But the asking price of homes is still increasing at a rate that is faster than income growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shallowing buyer pool and the lack of affordable homes has helped fuel the demand for rentals, said Calvin Schnure, economic analyst at the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. "There's a shortage of every type of housing," he said, noting construction hasn't kept pace with population growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the Trump administration said it would explore using federal programs to reduce local barriers to housing construction, such as restrictive zoning. <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> also released a survey showing that American renters increasingly believe they will never afford to buy their own home.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. optimism about the economy deteriorated in June to its lowest level in 21 months as consumers fretted over escalating trade tensions and a cooling jobs market, according to a monthly barometer of Americans' mood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>, a private research group, said its index of consumer confidence fell to 121.5 in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was a nearly 10-point drop from 131.3 in May and was the index's lowest level since September 2017. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a reading of 131.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Tuesday, the Commerce Department said purchases of newly built single-family homes posted an unexpected decline in May. New-home sales decreased 7.8% from April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 626,000, the slowest pace of sales since December. That could weigh on overall economic growth in the second quarter of the year -- and came despite falling mortgage rates, which make homeownership more affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales are a relatively narrow slice of all U.S. home sales, and it can be volatile. Still, the two reports show "heightened anxiety" on the part of consumers, said Robert Frick, an economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People do not want to make a big purchase when they're nervous," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers in the latest <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> survey had a more downbeat view of the labor market, after hiring cooled in May. The share of respondents who said jobs were plentiful decreased slightly to 44% in June from 45.3% in May, while those who said jobs are hard to get rose to 16.4% from 11.8% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The escalation in trade and tariff tensions earlier this month appears to have shaken consumers' confidence," said Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Although the index remains at a high level, continued uncertainty could result in further volatility in the index and, at some point, could even begin to diminish consumers' confidence in the expansion," she said, referring to current economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of household assessments about the present economic situation decreased to 162.6 from 170.7, while an index tracking expectations for the future decreased to 94.1 from 105.0 last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the survey's cutoff date in mid-June, the trade outlook has improved somewhat. President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have agreed to meet in Japan this week, spurring hopes for a trade truce that could stave off a fresh round of tariffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also easing trade tensions, the U.S. said in early June that it would hold off on imposing tariffs on Mexico.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Americans purchased fewer new homes in May, a sign the housing sector remains on somewhat uneven footing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes decreased 7.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 626,000 in May, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. It was the slowest pace of sales since December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a sales pace of 683,000 homes in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly decline was driven by a 35.9% drop in sales in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Any time new home sales are up or down sharply because of one region, there is good reason to suspect that the move is fluky," Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities, wrote in a note to clients. He said strong sales of previously owned homes in May lessens any concern about the broader housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales data can be volatile and subject to revisions. The May decrease came with a margin of error of plus or minus 14.7 percentage points.  Sales in April  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-fell-in-april-11558620316?mod=article_inline]were revised up modestly to a 679,000 pace, while March sales were revised down to 705,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More broadly, new-homes sales have bounced back from a slump last summer and fall but remain below the postrecession high touched in November 2017. Sales are about half what they were during the peak of the housing bubble in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales are a relatively narrow slice of all U.S. home sales—about 90% of homes purchased in the U.S. are previously owned. Sales of previously owned homes rose in May [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-rose-strongly-in-may-11561125827?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=2&amp;mod=article_inline], increasing 2.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.34 million, the National Association of Realtors said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two markets moved in opposite directions last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mounting concerns about the global economy have pushed down borrowing costs, and that appears to be aiding the market for previously owned homes. Mortgage rates are down more than a percentage point from late last year, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That helps make properties more affordable for buyers who finance their purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Low unemployment  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-may-nonfarm-payrolls-increased-by-75-000-11559910687?mod=article_inline]and rising wages are putting more households in a position to buy, somewhat insulating the broader real-estate sector from a global slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's report showed the number of new homes for sale in May would last 6.4 months at the recent pace. That is up from 5.6 months a year earlier. The median sales price of a new home in May was $308,000, down from $316,700 a year earlier. But lower prices and more supply didn't stoke better demand last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While sales fell sharply in the Northeast and West, they rose in the South to the highest level in a decade. That is a positive sign because the South is the largest region for new-home sales.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Will Parker </div><div>403 words</div><div>25 June 2019</div><div>12:28</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growth of U.S. home prices continued to slow in April in another sign of a weaker-than-expected selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average home prices in major metropolitan areas rose 3.5% in the year ended in April, decelerating from 3.7% the prior month and 3.9% in February, according to the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index. The decline reflects decreasing demand and an increasing supply, analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home price gains continued in a trend of broad-based moderation," said Philip Murphy, managing director of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of home-price growth has been slowing for a year now. But average prices are still increasing in most major U.S. cities and continue to outpace inflation, according to the Case-Shiller report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. cities with the largest price growth in April included Las Vegas, Phoenix and Tampa, where prices increased by more than 5%. But prices in the largest U.S. cities are growing slower than the country at large.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report's 10-city and 20-city composite indexes of the largest metropolitan areas increased only 2.3% and 2.5%, respectively. Seattle was the only major city where prices were flat in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists described the yearlong trend of decelerating price growth as a process of normalization after several years of steep price climbs. "That really starts to wear on affordability after a while, so I think things are evening out," said Ruben Gonzalez, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty, Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price deceleration persists despite mortgage rates that are near historic lows. Existing home sales figures for May reported earlier this month by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> suggest there has been a recent uptick in buyers taking advantage of those low rates after a slow start to the selling season. But some economists said that uptick means the housing market might finally start mirroring the growth of the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now prospective buyers can expect more modest price increases than were seen in recent years, said Zillow economist Matthew Speakman. "This slowdown has been widely expected for some time, and is likely to give many would-be buyers some much-needed breathing room."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rose 2.5% in May</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes rose in May, a sign that falling mortgage rates could be nudging the housing market toward a modest spring performance after a sluggish start to this prime selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales increased 2.5% in May from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.34 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roughly 40% of the year's sales take place in March through June. May was the first month this spring when sales rose from the prior month, but compared with a year earlier sales in May still declined 1.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates are below 4% for the first time since January 2018, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That is down from nearly 5% in the fall, a saving of about $200 a month for the typical home buyer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of previously owned homes rose in May, a sign that falling mortgage rates could be nudging the housing market toward a modest spring performance after a sluggish start to this prime selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales rose 2.5% in May from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.34 million, the National Association of Realtors said Friday [https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/existing-home-sales-ascend-2-5-in-may].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spring is crucial to the housing market because roughly 40% of the year's sales take place in March through June. May was the first month this spring when sales rose from the prior month, but compared with a year earlier sales in May still declined 1.1%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market struggled late last year even as the rest of the economy boomed, in part because higher mortgage rates priced some buyers out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, analysts said the housing market may be benefiting from growing economic uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are really seeing some headwinds in the broader economy right now, with the trade war and in the technology sector and also in manufacturing and agriculture," said Tian Liu, chief economist at Genworth Mortgage Insurance. "The housing market is actually less exposed to those headwinds right now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates are now below 4% [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/falling-mortgage-rates-spur-application-frenzy-11560357230] for the first time since January of last year, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That is down from nearly 5% in the fall, a saving of roughly $200 a month for the typical home buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve indicated Wednesday that it could cut interest rates [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-holds-rates-steady-hints-at-possible-cut-if-outlook-dims-11560967516] in the months ahead if an economic outlook clouded by uncertainty over trade policy doesn't improve, raising the prospect that mortgage rates may drift even lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ashley Lauren Farnschlader, a Realtor in Philadelphia, said she had one client reach out to her because she had read that mortgage rates were low and had decided to start looking for a home again. Still, Ms. Farnschlader added, "I don't think it's been the big push that everybody wants it to be."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, economists say the housing market's performance is surprisingly tepid given the sharp fall in mortgage rates. Some analysts said that suggests the market is moderating after years of rapid price growth and sales will struggle to reach previous highs of the current housing cycle in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Certainly with existing sales, I think we've seen the peak," said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added he expects most metropolitan areas to continue to see modest price and sales growth but that some, such as San Jose, Calif., are more vulnerable to a downturn because prices have risen so steeply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales have now fallen on an annual basis for 15 straight months. New home sales have grown strongly in recent months, but the construction sector has struggled. Housing starts fell 0.9% in May [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-housing-starts-declined-in-may-11560861140] from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.269 million, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. U.S. home-builder confidence also dropped in June [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-home-builder-confidence-slips-in-june-11560781139], as builders reported concerns over rising construction costs and trade issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are continuing to rise faster than incomes, which may be offsetting some of the additional buying power that consumers are getting from lower rates. The national median sale price for a previously owned home last month was $277,700, up 4.8% from a year earlier and the strongest monthly pace of growth since August 2018, the National Association of Realtors said Friday. It marked the 87th straight month of year-over-year gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News Corp., owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory of homes for sale is continuing to increase. The NAR said there were 1.92 million existing homes available for sale at the end of May, up 2.7% from a year earlier and a 4.3-month supply at the current sales pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market has been starved for inventory for years, but in this case economists said inventory levels are increasing primarily because homes are taking longer to sell so the growing choices aren't necessarily appealing ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city of Boston has seen roughly a 30% increase in inventory compared with the same time last year, according to Larry Rideout, chairman of Boston-based Gibson Sotheby's International Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everything is always behind the curve," he said. "Everyone has decided it's the chance to [put their home on the market] and unfortunately they've missed that window."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>1018 words</div><div>20 June 2019</div><div>19:12</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of investor purchases of U.S. homes have climbed to an all-time high, a sign that rising home prices have done little to dampen demand for flipping homes or turning them into single-family rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big private-equity firms, real-estate speculators and others that buy properties comprised more than 11% of U.S. home purchasers in 2018, according to data released on Thursday by <span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investor purchases are the highest on record and nearly twice the levels before the 2008 housing crash. The investor interest poses a challenge for millennials and other first-time buyers who are increasingly looking to buy starter homes and are forced to compete with deep-pocketed cash buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big commercial property owners like <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> and <span class="companylink">Starwood Capital Group</span> began buying thousands of homes out of foreclosure during the housing bust. Many economists credit investors with helping to stabilize the housing market in 2011 and 2012 by buying with cash when prices were low and mortgage credit froze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But analysts expected those purchases to slow, as the market rebounded and properties could no longer be had for fire-sale prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, demand for properties has intensified. While these purchases dipped slightly when the market started to recover in 2015 and 2016, they have rebounded to surpass the previous peak of six years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong rental demand, technology that facilitates buying homes online and low interest rates that make other investments less appealing have fueled investor appetite.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How much do you think professional investors influence home prices or sales activity in the housing market? Join the conversation below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are an especially powerful force at the bottom of the market, where they often pay all cash. Investors purchased one in five homes in the bottom third price range in 2018, according to the <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> analysis, up 5 percentage points from the 20-year average of less than 15%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These are the homes that first-time home buyers would logically be buying," said Ralph McLaughlin, deputy chief economist at <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shane Parker, a real-estate agent in metropolitan Detroit, said first-time buyers he works with are struggling to win bidding wars against out-of-state buyers. The locals he works with are becoming more aggressive, putting in escalation clauses and agreeing to pay the difference if properties don't appraise.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of his clients, Michael Burnett, a tech writer in Detroit, and his wife are looking for their first home so they can have a treehouse for their young girls. They have visited 25 properties and bid on half a dozen but keep losing out to cash buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple recently fell in love with a property they thought had great potential. "It's ugly on the outside, ugly on the inside, but it can be made beautiful," said Mr. Burnett, 43 years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house ended up getting a dozen offers, more than half of which were cash, and selling for $40,000 over the asking price of $150,000. "We write letters. You think you've composed this great heartfelt, 'I have a family, see my family,'" he said. "Oh, please…Cash is king."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate entrepreneur Gregor Watson's business has helped boost investor participation. Following the housing bust, he and partners bought more than 6,000 homes across the country and turned them into single-family rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then he founded Roofstock, a company that enables investors to purchase properties online. The internet has made it easier for smaller investors and foreign buyers to purchase properties they may never have visited. Demand is also shifting toward former industrial cities in the Northeast and Midwest where prices remain low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Watson said that many people in San Francisco and New York are priced out of buying homes where they live but are able to purchase an investment property in less expensive cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Pickens, 31, who works in tech sales in the Bay Area, and his wife kept losing out in bidding wars to all-cash offers. "It was all cash, no contingency, seven-day close," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his wife decided instead to rent a small apartment in <span class="companylink">Santa Clara County</span> and buy investment homes on Roofstock in less expensive locales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They now own homes in Georgia and Tennessee despite never having visited either state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So-called iBuyers, such as Opendoor, Zillow Offers and RedfinNow, which snap up homes in cash for a fee to help sellers avoid the hassle of putting their homes on the market, comprised less than 2% of investor purchases last year, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest markets for investor purchases in 2018 were Detroit, followed by Philadelphia and Memphis, Tenn., where home prices are still low enough for investors to profit by renting them out. Investors bought nearly half the starter homes in Philadelphia last year and about 40% of lower-priced homes in Detroit, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Tawan Davis launched a business renting out single-family homes three years ago, he focused on Philadelphia because of the city's slow foreclosure process and history of disinvestment, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Davis typically purchases homes for about $75,000 to $90,000, puts an additional $50,000 to $80,000 into renovation and rents them out for around $1,300 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he is often welcomed in these neighborhoods because his modestly priced rental properties help act as a bulwark against gentrification. Many of his renters are single and work as nurses or adjunct professors, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They'd much rather see us than a lawyer from New York," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After agreeing to pay just over $700,000 for a home, built in the 1920s in the Houston Heights area of Houston, Lee and Christa Gilley were shocked to see that Zillow, the real-estate data aggregator, had estimated the home's value at just $530,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We didn't want to get taken advantage of," recalls Mr. Gilley, a 32-year-old tech entrepreneur, of discovering the "Zestimate," Zillow's estimated home value. "Are we doing the right thing? Is the wool being pulled over our eyes?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe, but they'd never know one way or the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas is a nondisclosure state, one of about a dozen in the U.S., in which the sales price of homes isn't required to be publicly disclosed. (Some states are legally nondisclosure states but sales prices can be easily extrapolated by looking at publicly recorded transfer tax information, which is disclosed in those states.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Gilleys, as a result, were forced to rely exclusively on comparable sales data provided by their realtor, and they had no independent way to verify that those comps were representative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In nondisclosure states, the Gilleys, Zillow and other content aggregators, some local government tax and appraisal officials, and anyone else who needs previous sale price data to make decisions about a home's value is out of luck. They must instead get that information from real-estate agents who have been involved in local sales or have access to the local Multiple Listings Service, or from sporadically available mortgage data. Or they could just walk around town and ask other homeowners what they paid. None of these techniques are likely to yield a comprehensive result.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not just buyers and sellers who struggle with the lack of information. Anyone paying property tax in nondisclosure states may be suffering as well: Local governments complain that the lack of disclosure causes systematic and dramatic under- or over-appraisal of properties, leading to disproportionately large tax burdens on some owners, and lower-than-expected burdens on others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 2004 study in Social Science Quarterly argued that nondisclosure states had "inequities in effective tax rates and tax revenue leakages." In particular, after analyzing data for homes in Albuquerque, N.M. the study found "substantial tax inequities," with lower-priced homes contributing "more than [their] share of properties taxes." Recent studies in Texas have found the same effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Texas, for example, difficult-to-assess commercial properties and high-end homes tend to be undervalued, said Dick Lavine, an analyst with the Center for Public Policy Priorities. "Most high-end residential and many larger commercial and industrial properties are paying less than their fair share and shifting the burden onto ordinary and middle-class homeowners," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors in nondisclosure states say that homeowner and buyer privacy trumps other concerns. "The purpose of it is protecting the consumer," said real-estate agent Keith McMullin of Port Aransas Realty in Texas. He said clients from out of state are often surprised, but pleased, when they learn that their home purchase price won't be made public, because "your nosy neighbor can't go to Zillow and find out what you sold your house for."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some brokers also argue that sales prices disclosure is unnecessary because they can provide market information for their clients, since they have access to closed sales prices through the local MLS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Share Your Thoughts</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do you think home sales prices should be publicly available? Why or why not?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not all counties have MLS systems, and those that do vary widely in their rules, with some including closed sales data and some not. Moreover, a growing number of listings across the country are withheld from the MLS and instead marketed privately, noted Manhattan real estate appraiser Jonathan Miller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Gilleys' agent, Amy McGee of <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker</span> United, Realtors, says she worries that if Texas became a disclosure state, home buyers might think they no longer need a broker, when in her opinion, "raw data isn't enough. You can't pick up a book about dentistry and drill someone's teeth."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents' fears of disintermediation haven't, by all accounts, been realized by real-estate agents in the roughly 40 states where sales prices are made public. In fact, some who have worked in both types of states say disclosure makes their job easier. But despite this, the real-estate lobby has been successful in blocking many recent attempts in nondisclosure states to bring more sales price transparency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For markets to function effectively, buyers and sellers need information," said Mike Kadas, former director of the Department of Revenue in the nondisclosure state of Montana. "With that information, someone is less likely to be taken advantage of or get a screaming deal, because they can make more informed choices about what market prices are."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changes to disclosure rules have been proposed, and failed to pass, in nearly every Texas legislative session for the 20 past years. Texas Realtors (formerly known as the <span class="companylink">Texas Association of Realtors</span>), one of the state's most powerful lobbying groups, has been instrumental in blocking the law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A private transaction between myself and you should be kept private," said Daniel Gonzalez, director of legislative affairs for Texas Realtors. "We should not have to give the government any indication of what we're doing in our private lives."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, Texas state representative Michelle Beckley introduced a bill mandating that county clerk filings of real-estate transactions include the sale price, but it died in May in the House Committee on Business &amp; Industry. Political-action committee donations from Texas Realtors were the largest single source of donations to state representatives who sat on that committee in 2019. Drew Darby, vice chair of the committee, has received roughly $185,000 in contributions from Texas Realtors during his career, while another member, Tan Parker, has received approximately $80,000 from the group, according to data from the National Institute on Money in Politics. Neither Mr. Darby or Mr. Parker returned a request for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate industry has also lobbied against disclosure efforts in Montana. In 2015, Mr. Kadas worked with state Sen. Dick Barrett to introduce a bill allowing disclosure of real-estate sales prices in that state, where tax appraisers have access to the data, but homeowners don't. This makes it difficult for owners to challenge their property tax assessments, explained Mr. Kadas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measure was opposed by the Montana Association of Realtors, which spent about $154,000 on lobbying efforts in 2015 and about $115,000 in 2014 in preparation for the battle, according to the National Institute on Money in Politics. The MAR also received $50,000 from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> earmarked to oppose sales price disclosure. "They have a huge monopoly on that information and they want to protect that," Mr. Kadas said. A compromise was reached. Montana homeowners who want to challenge their assessments are now allowed to see the prices of some nearby homes, but must sign a confidentiality agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Simonich, CEO of MAR, denied that his group is trying to protect an information monopoly, and said its primary concern is "maintaining the privacy of individuals."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Mr. Kadas' view, privacy concerns are outweighed by consumers' right to know if they're getting a fair price. "To me, it's not a real serious thing if your neighbors know how much you sold your house for," he said. "For most things we know the prices—cars, computers, you name it. That's why the economy works—we can shop around and compare."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the Gilleys, they ultimately did close on their Houston home despite their concerns of overpaying, and Mr. Gilley said he's now fairly confident they got a fair price. But for Mr. Gilley, the lack of accurate data made the process more stressful. "Because Zillow and all that was so off," he said, "it added a little bit of apprehension."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real Estate Agents say Disclosure Makes Their Job Easier</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite intense opposition to sales prices disclosure by the real-estate lobby, many real-estate agents in disclosure states say the greater availability of information makes their job easier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frederick Peters, head of Manhattan's Warburg Realty, said many co-op buyers and sellers weren't happy when New York City co-op sales prices became public in 2006, but overall the greater transparency has been "a gift" to brokers because it makes it easier to price properties accurately. After the change, "we weren't guessing about comps anymore," he said. Previously, "you were always sort of guessing and trying to call in favors for other agents by asking them what they had gotten for something. It was a much more inexact science."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Full disclosure of sales prices makes real-estate markets more efficient, meaning people are less likely to pay wildly low or high prices, explained Manhattan real estate appraiser Jonathan Miller. Since New York City co-op data became public, he said, "people are better informed. One-bedrooms sell for $900,000—you're not likely to have outliers like $500,000 or $2 million."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida-based real-estate agent Gene Martinez of Compass said over the years, "I have found that having more information is just better for everyone."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, "we're living at a time where the public demands an increased level of information and transparency," he said. "To me, it's odd that you wouldn't disclose what a sales price would be."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Alphabet Inc</span>.'s <span class="companylink">Google</span> said it would commit $1 billion to boost housing construction in the San Francisco Bay Area, the latest in a series of commitments by tech companies to address an affordability crisis in the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai announced the moves Tuesday in a blog post in which he said the commitment will include the repurposing of $750 million of company-owned land from commercial to residential use on which an estimated 15,000 units will be built, across all income levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Google</span> will also create a $250 million fund for loans and other types of financing. The funds will go to developers to help them preserve affordable housing and build new homes, including at least 5,000 new below-market-rate units, Mr. Pichai said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As we work to build a more helpful <span class="companylink">Google</span>, we know our responsibility to help starts at home," the CEO wrote. The company will also give $50 million through its charitable arm, Google.org, to nonprofits working to address homelessness and displacement, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world's biggest technology companies are facing pressure to turn their attention to their hometowns on the West Coast where a tech-driven jobs boom has strained a housing market already short on supply. Rising rents around tech hubs from Seattle to Silicon Valley have pushed out low-to-middle-income workers from once-affordable neighborhoods, helping fuel widespread homelessness.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities and states struggling to stem these issues have increasingly turned to the tech industry for help. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom, who praised <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s announcement in a statement, has specifically called on Silicon Valley to invest in helping address the state's housing shortage, which he estimates at 3.5 million homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Google</span>'s new housing play comes at a time when the company is growing its footprint in the region. It is building a new campus in its hometown of Mountain View, Calif., which extracted a commitment from the company to build affordable housing as part of its expansion. <span class="companylink">Google</span> is also in talks with San Jose for a potential new campus that would bring 20,000 employees to the city. Housing and displacement have been flashpoints for local communities there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics say these investments don't go far enough. "There is clearly still more it needs to do, but it's a very welcome first step towards fully addressing its impact on rent hikes, evictions and overcrowding," said Jeffrey Buchanan, director of public policy at Working Partnerships USA, a nonprofit focused on addressing inequality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a study the group commissioned, <span class="companylink">the city of San Jose</span> alone would need more than 17,650 new homes—at least 5,200 of them affordable—to offset rent increases expected from new demand for housing as <span class="companylink">Google</span> builds out in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry at large has taken note: In January, a group of Bay Area companies and philanthropists including Facebook Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg raised $260 million to help build at least 8,000 homes in the region, part of what they envision as a $500 million fund for affordable housing[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/facebook-ceo-firms-to-raise-500-million-for-san-francisco-area-housing-11548360034]. A separate fund seeded by <span class="companylink">LinkedIn</span>, the Cisco Foundation and other tech philanthropists has raised $62 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Seattle area, <span class="companylink">Microsoft Corp</span>. in January pledged $500 million to support affordable housing[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/microsofts-answer-to-seattle-areas-housing-problem-500-million-11547701071]: $475 million for construction loans and $25 million in grants to address homelessness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> and <span class="companylink">Amazon.com Inc</span>. last week gave $5 million each to a Seattle nonprofit that operates housing and support services for homeless people. <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> also said it would put $3 million toward affordable-housing initiatives in Arlington, Va., the site of its planned new headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Northern California, the Bay Area has led the nation in home prices for the past two decades, and new jobs continue to far outpace the addition of new homes. Proposed legislation aimed at making it easier to build more dense housing in California has stalled amid opposition, mostly from suburban homeowners resistant to new development.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Man Who Probed</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ex-Governor Indicted</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An investigator in the case that led to last year's resignation of Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens was accused of lying and concealing evidence in an indictment unsealed Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Tisaby, a former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent brought in to help investigate Mr. Greitens, was charged with six counts of perjury and one count of evidence tampering stemming from that work. Mr. Greitens, a Republican, was criminally charged with misconduct related to an extramarital affair he admitted to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greitens denied he broke any laws. His lawyer, Scott Rosenblum, said he continued to deny the charge. A new charge was later filed relating to campaign-finance irregularities. Those charges were dropped a day after Mr. Greitens resigned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kimberly Gardner, a Democrat, had hired Mr. Tisaby to investigate Mr. Greitens, which led to charges last year of invasion of privacy for taking a picture of his partially clad mistress without her consent and transmitting it to a computer. Mr. Greitens was accused by the woman of threatening to release the photo if she told anyone about the affair, according to a Missouri House investigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greitens's defense had accused the prosecution of misconduct by allowing Mr. Tisaby to perjure himself, leading a St. Louis judge last year to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate those charges. Mr. Tisaby's indictment is the first to come out of that investigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tisaby pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for Ms. Gardner declined to comment, citing a gag order imposed by the court. A spokesman for Gerard Carmody, the special prosecutor, declined to comment, also citing the gag order.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—A gauge of U.S. home building declined in May, a fresh sign of weakness in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 0.9% in May from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.269 million, the Commerce Department  said Tuesday [https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf].

The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> housing market index fell to 64 this month from 66 in May, the trade group said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's housing data, "along with a constellation of other economic factors, could weigh on the Federal Reserve's scales regarding whether or not they will cut rates, which would potentially provide some stimulus for the economy and the housing market," said John Pataky, executive vice president at TIAA Bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed officials meet Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington, and are expected to deliberate whether to lower interest rates  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-debates-whether-rate-cut-moment-has-arrived-11560850201]should the economic outlook darken.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-starts data are volatile from month to month and can be subject to large revisions. May's 0.9% drop in starts came with a margin of error of 12.9 percentage points.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday: The <span class="companylink">U.S. Commerce Department</span> releases housing-starts data for May. The gauge of home building across the U.S. increased in April, driven by an uptick in single-family construction.

A host of factors, including a lack of available land and rising input costs have driven up prices, causing a slowdown in the broader U.S. housing market.
